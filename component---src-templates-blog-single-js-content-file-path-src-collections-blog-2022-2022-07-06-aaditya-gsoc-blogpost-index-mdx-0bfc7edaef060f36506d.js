Slowly I realized that I don’t want to make projects that satisfy just my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world.

I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time, I was comfortable with it. I am thankful that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing.
