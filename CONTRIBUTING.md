We encourage community curation of the landscape (all are encouraged to participate). We also encourage representatives of the projects/products in the landscape to curate and maintain their listings so as to guarantee their freshness and accuracy of representation. 

### <a name="updating-the-service-mesh-landscape">Updating the Landscape</a>

The service mesh landscape is powered by Jekyll. In order to add/update the landscape, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the **_data/categories** folder. Edit these yaml files (if appropriate):

- [non-functional.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/categories/non-functional.yml) - overview of various service meshes
- [meshes.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/categories/meshes.yml) - list of individual service mesh details
- [proxies.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/categories/proxies.yml) - list of individual modern proxies
- [gw.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/categories/gw.yml) - list of API gateways
- [lb.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/categories/lb.yml) - list of load balancers

Entries should be listed in alphabetical order. Edit other yaml files as needed. 

### <a name="news">Adding News</a>

1. In order to add/update news items, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the `collections/_news` directory. 
1. Create a copy of the [news template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/collections/_news/0000-00-00-news-template.md).

### <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" ><img src="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" width="50%"><a>

### <a name="flow">Contribution Flow</a>
