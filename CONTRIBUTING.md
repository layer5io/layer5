  - [Site Performance Considerations](#site-performance-considerations)

The following list of instructions pertains to commonplace site updates by contributors.

## Things to keep in mind

1. Prioritize using only the theme colors and hexcodes that are already being used in [themeStyles.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/theme/app/themeStyles.js) instead of introducing new color codes to the file.
2. Avoid adding `rel="noreferrer"` attribute to internal links on the site. Use gatsby [`<Link>` component](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/linking-between-pages/) for internal links on the site.

## Adding dark mode for components

The site currently has dark and light mode, the colors used in these two modes can be found in the dark and light theme objects in [themeStyles.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/theme/app/themeStyles.js).

These theme objects use a property whose value automatically changes based on the active theme without using a conditional.

An example of a conditional:

```
theme === "dark" ? "white" : "black"
```

The preference is to **not use conditionals** for elements because they will flicker when reloading a page in dark mode.

As currently constructed, the dark and light theme objects share similar property names that have different values.

The property name will tell you how the value (color or hexcode) will change from dark mode to light mode. The first part is for dark mode, then "To", and the next part is for light mode.

example #1: `whiteToBlack`

"white" is the first part for dark mode
"To"
"Black" is the second part for light mode

In dark mode the value of `whiteToBlack` will be `white`
In light mode the value of `whiteToBlack` will be `black`

example #2: `grey141414ToGreyF5F5F5`

In dark mode this value will be `#141414` (a dark shade of grey)
In light mode this value will be `#F5F5F5` (a light shade of grey).

The hexcode in the property name is the indication of the color shade being used in the active theme. Always check the hexcode to confirm it is the desired shade/color.

In a styled component, you can use the property name in the following way:

#### Examples

example #1:
`color: ${props => props.theme.whiteToBlack};`

example #2:
`color: ${props => props.theme.greyDEE3DEToGreen3C494F}`

### Adding a new color pair transition property

It is recommended to use pre-existing styles, colors, hexcodes from the theme. Avoid adding your own CSS variables and incorporating new colors.

If you must add a new property that changes with the theme:

1. Add a new property with the same name to the dark and light theme objects in [themeStyles.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/theme/app/themeStyles.js) and the corresponding values you want them to have in each mode.

#### Example:

```
const lighttheme = {
  blue0000FFToRedFF0000: "#FF0000",
```

```
const darktheme = {
  blue0000FFToRedFF0000: "#0000FF",

```

2. Use that property name in your styled component

```
color: ${props => props.theme.blue0000FFToRedFF0000};
```

### Adding the transition property to the element in the styled component

Transition property is not inherited. It must be added for each element that is changing colors and be consistent with the transition timing and style of the background color in [`GlobalStyle`](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/sections/app.style.js) to ensure uniform color change.

Currently this property:value is

```
transition: 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1);
```

## Adding SVG and Images Guidelines

Each image on a website adds to [page weight/page size](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/page-weight-website-speed#:~:text=What%20is%20page%20weight%20or,to%20load%20for%20the%20visitor.) affecting loading times, especially on mobile browsers. In general, images for the site should be optimized for file size, format, and dimensions.

Preferred:
  file size: less than 500Kbs, ideally less than 100kbs.
  format: webp
  dimensions: 
    - if background image, width no bigger than 2000px
    - most other web images should not need a width bigger than 1200px
    - helpful [image optimzation tool](https://tiny-img.com/webp/) (more tools under "tools" tab)
 (more guidelines available [here](https://tiny-img.com/blog/best-image-size-for-website/))

In addition, it is preferred that the images have these qualities with regards to the site's dark and light theme colors:

- SVG or image does not need to change colors depending on the theme

OR

- SVG or image uses transparent sections that change with the background color to work with either theme.

[Example of SVG file with transparent sections](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/assets/images/meshmap/icon-only/meshmap-icon.svg)

[Example of image file with transparent sections](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/assets/images/app/projects/meshery-logo-light.webp)

You can see these two examples in action [here](https://layer5.io/projects) by toggling the theme (located on the right side of the navigation bar).

The above are the preferred kinds of SVG and images. If your SVG or image fits one of the descriptions above, then you do not need to read further.

### Changing SVG according to theme

SVG image formats are the preferred format because of the ability to control colors used to fill path or stroke with styled-components and have them change dependent on the theme without using a conditional.

#### Importing SVG as a React Component

To use the SVG as an `svg` element and not a source for an `img` element, we will import the SVG as a ReactComponent. You can see an example of importing the SVG as a ReactComponent in the code [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/sections/General/Navigation/index.js)

```
import { ReactComponent as Logo } from "../../../assets/images/app/layer5-colorMode.svg";
```

Then we include the component where you want to display it

```
<Link to="/" className="logo">
    <Logo />
</Link>
```

#### Adding the color change property to the SVG

To change a fill for a SVG depending on the theme, you will need to create a class in the SVG to fill inner paths or rect or polygon with default colors, then assign that SVG class in a styled-component to a property value as done in components.

#### Example: Layer5 Logo

To see the code for this SVG click [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/assets/images/app/layer5-colorMode.svg?short_path=e76da80). (note: if link is not working , click [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/assets/images/app/layer5-colorMode.svg) and then click the "<>" button to display the source blob.)

In the SVG code, we see classes declared here:

```
<defs>
        <style>
            .colorMode1 {
                fill: #fff
            }
          ...
        </style>
</defs>
```

We use `colorMode[#]` in the class name to designate classes that we want to change depending on the theme.

Then in the related styled component, we use a specific class generated by styled-components to add the theme property.

In our example with the logo in the navigation, this is the relevant [styled component](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/sections/General/Navigation/navigation.style.js).

Here, if we want to update the CSS of the SVG then we target the appropriate parent class. For this example, looking at the where the SVG React component (`<Logo />`) was placed, we see `className="logo"` as the relevant parent class.

```
<Link to="/" className="logo">
    <Logo />
</Link>
```

In the styled component, we find ".logo", add the `svg` element, and within that add the class that is generated by the styled-component plugin, in our example it is `.layer5-colorMode_svg__colorMode1`.

> Note: the styled-component generated class name is based off the file name and the colorMode class name, using the following structure:
>
> svg file name (`layer5-colorMode`)

- a separator (`_svg___`)
- the class name being targetted inside the SVG (`colorMode1`)
  > this results in the class `.layer5-colorMode_svg__colorMode1`

```
 .logo {
    margin-top: 8px;

    svg {
      width: 155px;
      .layer5-colorMode_svg__colorMode1 {
        fill: ${props => props.theme.whiteToGreen3C494F};
        transition: fill 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1);
      }
    }
  }
```

> Notes:
>
> - You can add presentation css attributes to `svg` similar to how you would add to an `img`.
> - You can find the generated class name when you inspect the element in the browser console and look at the styles section of the svg code.
> - Even though we have a default fill property in the SVG itself (just in case), the fill property in the styled component will override it.
> - Whenever we are changing colors in a SVG, be sure to add the transition timing and style that is used for the background color in [GlobalStyle](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/sections/app.style.js) to have everything smoothly transition. Currently this property: value is
>
> ```
>  transition: 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.8, 0.2, 1);
> ```

## Changing images depending on the theme.

If possibe we wish to avoid using images dependent on the theme because we are required to use a conditional (which will cause a flicker of the image when the page is reloaded). If necessary, please use the following instructions.

1. To change images or SVG as the image source, according to the theme, you have to import the hook `useStyledDarkMode` from the following [folder](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/theme/app/useStyledDarkMode.js), and then use the `isDark` value from `useStyledDarkMode` hook for the conditional.

For example, you can view the code for [this file](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/sections/Meshmap/Meshmap-collaborate/meshmap-collaborate-banner.js).

Here are the relevant parts of the code:

```
import { useStyledDarkMode } from "../../../theme/app/useStyledDarkMode";

const { isDark } = useStyledDarkMode();

 <img className="canvas" src={isDark ? EmptyDark : EmptyLight} alt="" />
```

## Changing images in gatsby-image-plugin according to the theme.

Procedure of changing the image for the gatsby-image is the same as we change for images, however, it is recommended to fetch two images, one for a dark theme and one for a light theme change it according to the `isDark` value as done with images.

Example (For Thumbnail):
Fetching images through Graphql. Add this in graphql query in frontmatter

      darkthumbnail {
      childImageSharp {
        gatsbyImageData(layout: FULL_WIDTH)
      }
      extension
      publicURL
    }

Change image according to isDark value:

```
<Image
      {...((isDark && frontmatter.darkthumbnail.publicURL !== frontmatter.thumbnail.publicURL)
        ? frontmatter.darkthumbnail : frontmatter.thumbnail)}
      imgStyle={{ objectFit: "contain" }}
      alt={frontmatter.title}
    />
```

> Note:
>
> - A condition `frontmatter.darkthumbnail.publicURL !== frontmatter.thumbnail.publicURL` is added so that the image only changes if there is a difference between the thumbnail publicURLs.

## How to Add Images and Icons

1. It is recommended to use `@react-icons/all-files` instead of `react-icons` for importing icons. The issue with react-icons is that even though we are importing a single icon from the package/folder it still imports the complete icon folder which is creating unwanted junks of JS in the build.
2. It is recommended to use Gatsby's `<StaticImage>` instead of `<img>` tag to display static images on the site **except for SVG images**. This performs automatic image optimization, thereby improving site performance.
3. Avoid creating duplicate copies of the same image under different folders. All images must be imported from `/assets/images` folder.

## Updating/Creating a Community Member Profile

Layer5 community members are an integral part of what makes Layer5 and its projects successful. Prominently highlighting our members and their works is something that we think is important. To initiate adding a new or updating an existing community member profile, be sure to use the community member [issue template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity%2C+help+wanted%2C+framework%2Fgatsby%2C+language%2Fmarkdown%2C+good+first+issue&template=community_member_profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A). When creating or updating a community member profile, use the [profile template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/master/src/collections/members/_member-profile-template). You can easily understand how the template is used by reviewing other profiles.

### Badges for Community Members

Badges are a great way of highlighting the area of contribution by any given community member. A variety of badges exist so that community members and their efforts may be affiliated with a particular project or with a community initiative. An example of how a badge is assigned using markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/members/lee-calcote/index.mdx), and it will appear [this way](https://layer5.io/community/members/lee-calcote) on a member profile.

## Updating the Service Mesh Landscape

Another common site update includes the updation of the Service Mesh Landscape. The service mesh landscape is powered by Gatsby.js. To update the landscape, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the **src/collections/landscape** folder.

Make sure to open a [new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Flandscape&template=landscape.md&title=%5BLandscape%5D) first. Following is a list of files that you may edit and make the necessary updates (if appropriate):

- [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/non-functional.js) - overview of various service meshes
- [meshes.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/meshes.js) - list of individual service mesh details
- [proxies.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/proxies.js) - list of individual modern proxies
- [gateway.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/gateways.js) - list of API gateways
- [load-balancer.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/load-balancer.js) - list of load balancers

Entries should be listed in alphabetical order. Data provided to the `smi.js` is dynamic and based upon results from conformance tests run using Meshery.

To update the Service Mesh Timeline, add the new service mesh in the [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/non-functional.js) file. Add an `announce-date` key for the service mesh, then add a `timeline-order` key having a value 1+`maximum value of timeline-order` till now, to list the service mesh in the timeline correctly.

## Site Performance Considerations

1. Analyze page load metrics of mobile version in lighthouse report (see status of GitHub workflow on your open PR).
2. While creating a new page make sure to use Gatsby Head API for SEO.
3. Prefer using `loading="eager"` for Hero images to improve LCP(Largest Contentful Paint) and FCP(First Contentful Paint).
4. Optimise page by deferring loading of third party scripts. You can use [off-main-thread](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/built-in-components/gatsby-script/#off-main-thread-strategy-experimental) in Script API.
5. Prefer Code Splitting using [loadable](https://github.com/gregberge/loadable-components) to lazy load heavy components which are not in the viewport.

Note:- You can also refer to [Improving Site Performance](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/performance/improving-site-performance/), [web.dev](https://web.dev/vitals/).


# How to Contribute

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your operating system before you start contributing:

- [Nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  To verify run:

  ```
  node -v
  ```

  ```
  npm -v
  ```

- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

  To verify run:

  ```
  gatsby --version
  ```

**Note:** If you're on a _Windows environment_ then it is highly recommended that you install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) both for performance and ease of use. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/gatsby-on-wsl) for the installation of _Gatsby.js on WSL_.

## Set up your Local Development Environment

Follow the following instructions to start contributing.

**1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5) repository.

**2.** Clone your forked copy of the project.

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/<your-username>/layer5.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.

```
cd layer5
```

**4.** Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/layer5io/layer5.git
```

**5.** Check the remotes for this repository.

```
git remote -v
```

**6.** Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project (updated repository).

```
git pull upstream master
```

**7.** Create a new branch.

```
git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
```

**8.** Install the dependencies for running the site.

```
make setup
```

**9.** Make the desired changes.

**10.** Run the site locally to preview changes.

```
make site
```

This will run a local webserver with "live reload" conveniently enabled. ( **NOTE**: while using the make command on Windows, there sometimes arises an error in identifying the command even after it is installed (unrecognized command), this is because the PATH for the binary might not be set correctly ).

**11.** Track your changes.

```
git add .
```

**12.** Commit your changes. To contribute to this project, you must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](#signing-off-on-commits) for each commit you make.

```
git commit --signoff -m "<commit subject>"
```

or you could go with the shorter format for the same, as shown below.

```
git commit -s -m "<commit subject>"
```

**13.** While you are working on your branch, other developers may update the `master` branch with their branch. This action means your branch is now out of date with the `master` branch and missing content. So to fetch the new changes, follow along:

```
git checkout master
git fetch origin master
git merge upstream/master
git push origin
```

Now you need to merge the `master` branch into your branch. This can be done in the following way:

```
git checkout <your_branch_name>
git merge master
```

**14.** Push the committed changes in your feature branch to your remote repo.

```
git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
```

**15.** Once you’ve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. Please ensure that you compare your feature branch to the desired branch of the repo you are supposed to make a PR to. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it.

## Signing-off on Commits

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the **Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO)** for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

**Note:** you don't have to manually include this line on your commits, git does that for you as shown below:

```
$ git commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

In most cases, git automatically adds the signoff to your commit with the use of
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global `.gitconfig`:

_~/.gitconfig_

```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```

Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./.github/assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.webp" ><img src="./.github/assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.webp" width="50%"/><a>

## What to Expect For `development` and `production` Builds

When you do a cold build (this means that there are no cached files from previous builds, or you have used the `make clean` or `gatsby clean` command), it will take longer to build, depending on your systems memory/processor, it can take around **10-15 minutes**. We are working to reduce this time. If you experience unsuccessful builds or extremely long build times, or memory crashes, please post in the [Layer 5 Community Discussion](https://discuss.layer5.io/c/community/12) or Layer 5 Slack #support channel.  

Warm development and production builds are much faster as Gatsby will use cache files when possible during the build.

When you run a gatsby build command, you can expect your terminal/console to show the following output (remember timing can be dependent on your system):

</details>

**note**: There is a temporary workaround to help with overly long build times if your changes do not involve `.mdx` files. In the file `layer5/.env.development`, you can set the `GATSBY_DEV_AMENDED` env variable to `true`, and save the file. This will restrict the number of mdx files to include in a development build. Remember to change this env variable back to `false` and do not commit changes to this file (it should be `.gitignored`).

## Additional Developer Notes

### Sitewide Changes
If you are making changes that affect multiple or all site pages, remember that pages are also built from `.mdx` files (in the `src/collections` folder and `content-learn` folder that is outside of the `src` folder) using files in the `src/templates` folder.

If your code involves modifying path names, please note that in live production builds on GitHub Pages (the Layer5 host server), the pathnames will end in `.html` (e.g. `about.html`). This was done to address a flickering trailing slash issue. Otherwise in local development and production builds, pages are served as `index.html` (e.g. about/index.html). Click [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/4133) for more information.

### Dev and Browser Warnings You May Encounter

Note:

- These are **non-blocking warnings** you can expect to see in your terminal or browser while working in local development environment.
- They do not impact the performance of the code and are unrelated to your contributions.
- These will not show in `build` or `production` mode.
- These are being documented to minimize confusion for the user while doing development.

> warn ./node_modules/react-accessible-accordion/dist/es/index.js
> Attempted import error: 'useId' is not exported from 'react' (imported as 'useId').

and

> client.js:196 export 'useId' (imported as 'useId') was not found in 'react' (possible exports: Children, Component, Fragment, Profiler, PureComponent, StrictMode, Suspense, \_\_SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED, cloneElement, createContext, createElement, createFactory, createRef, forwardRef, isValidElement, lazy, memo, useCallback, useContext, useDebugValue, useEffect, useImperativeHandle, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useReducer, useRef, useState, version)

Where/When:

- In terminal: after `npm start`
- In browser: loading https://layer5.io

Reason: [https://github.com/springload/react-accessible-accordion/issues/351](https://github.com/springload/react-accessible-accordion/issues/351)

> V5 is a release we cut explicitly for React 18 support (Hence the major upgrade, this was a breaking change, the webpack fix would not work as we are using React 18 new APIs), we are sticking with V4 for React 17 and under compatibility, using V4 has no functional difference outside of React version compatibility.

Layer5 currently using:
"react-accessible-accordion": "^5.0.0"
react": "^17.0.2"

To clear the warning:
Upgrade the `react`package to ^18. However upgrading may introduce too many breaking changes and complexity.

---

> Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.
> Check the top-level render call using <head>. See https://reactjs.org/link/warning-keys for more information.
> at title

Where/When:

- In terminal: after `npm start` and loading page

Reason: In this version of Gatsby (4.20), the file:
`node_modules/gatsby/cache-dir/head/head-export-handler-for-ssr.js` is missing code to assign `key` prop to each head tag included in the `SEO` component.

To clear the warning:
This could be resolved by adding code to the package, but requires too much complexity to include for each user. This warning is cleared in later versions of Gatsby.

### Tool: Editing .md, .mdx files
For editing .md files like CONTRIBUTING.md, this is a [helpful editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) that maintains spacing with preview (note: local images will not appear).
For editing .mdx files, you can check MDX compatibility with this [editor](https://mdxjs.com/playground/).
