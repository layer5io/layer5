### Common Types of Site Updates

#### Community Member Profile ([create new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity&template=New+Member+Profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A))

Layer5 community members are an integral part of what makes Layer5 and it's projects successful. Prominently highlighting our members and their works is important. When adding a new or updating an existing community member profile, be sure to use the [Community Member Profile issue template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity&template=New+Member+Profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A), which has all the instructions needed. 

#### <a name="updating-the-service-mesh-landscape">Updating the Service Mesh Landscape ([create new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Flandscape&template=landscape.md&title=%5BLandscape%5D))

The service mesh landscape is powered by Gatsbyjs. In order to add/update the landscape, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the **\_data/categories** folder. Edit these yaml files (if appropriate):

- [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/layer5-ng/src/sections/Landscape/non-functional.js) - overview of various service meshes
- [meshes.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/layer5-ng/src/sections/Landscape/meshes.js) - list of individual service mesh details
- [proxies.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/layer5-ng/src/sections/Landscape/proxies.js) - list of individual modern proxies
- [gw.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/layer5-ng/src/sections/Landscape/gw.js) - list of API gateways
- [lb.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/layer5-ng/src/sections/Landscape/lb.js) - list of load balancers

Entries should be listed in alphabetical order. Data provided to the `smi.js` is dynamic and based upon results from conformance tests run using Meshery.

To update the Service Mesh Timeline, add the new service mesh in the [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/layer5-ng/src/sections/non-functional.js) file. Add `announce-date` key for the service mesh then add a `timeline-order` key having value 1+`maximum value of timeline-order` till now, to list the service mesh in the timeline correctly.

### <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" ><img src="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" width="50%"/><a>
