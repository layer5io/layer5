### <a name="updating-the-service-mesh-landscape">Updating the Landscape</a>

The service mesh landscape is powered by Jekyll. In order to add/update the landscape, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the **\_data/categories** folder. Edit these yaml files (if appropriate):

- [non-functional.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/landscape/non-functional.yml) - overview of various service meshes
- [meshes.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/landscape/meshes.yml) - list of individual service mesh details
- [proxies.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/landscape/proxies.yml) - list of individual modern proxies
- [gw.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/landscape/gw.yml) - list of API gateways
- [lb.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/landscape/lb.yml) - list of load balancers

Entries should be listed in alphabetical order. Edit other yaml files as needed.

- Aslo, to update the Service Mesh Timeline, add the new service mesh in the [non-functional.yml](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/_data/landscape/non-functional.yml) file. Add `announce-date` key for the service mesh then add a `timeline-order` key having value 1+`maximum value of timeline-order` till now, to list the service mesh in the timeline correctly.

### <a name="news">Adding News</a>

1. In order to add/update news items, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the `collections/_news` directory.
1. Create a copy of the [news template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/collections/_news/0000-00-00-news-template.md).
1. Follow the instructions included in the news template and name the new file after the title of the news article.
1. Entries will be listed in chronological order automatically.

### <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:

```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global `.gitconfig`:

_~/.gitconfig_

```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```

Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" ><img src="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" width="50%"><a>

### Set Up Your Development Environment

- First [install Ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/), then install Jekyll and Bundler.

**Note:** Windows users can run Jekyll by following the [Windows Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/), for Jekyll. This includes installing the Ruby Version Manager [RVM](https://rvm.io) - a command-line tool that allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments on your local machine.
Alternatively, if you are running Windows 10, you may install the Windows Subsystem for Linux:

- [WSL1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) for Windows build version 1607 or higher.

### <a name="flow">Contribution Flow</a>

Please contribute! The Layer5 site uses GitHub Pages (Jekyll) to host its site. The process of contributing to documentation follows this flow:

1. Fork a copy of this repo.
1. Get a local clone of your fork of the site.
   `git clone https://github.com/layer5io/layer5`
1. Create and checkout a new branch to make changes within
   `git checkout -b <my-username>/<my-changes>`
1. Edit site/add content.
   `vi <specific page>.md` # or use your favorite IDE
1. Run site locally to preview changes.
   `make site` # this will run a local web server with "live reload" conveniently enabled.

- **Note:** _From the Makefile, this command is actually running `$ bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload`. There are two Jekyll configuration, `jekyll serve` for developing locally and `jekyll build` when you need to generate the site artefacfs for production._

1. Commit and push changes to your remote branch.
   `git push origin <my-username>/<my-changes>`
1. Open a [pull request](../../pulls) (in your web browser) against the master branch on https://github.com/layer5io/layer5.

Build and preview your changes by running `make site` or `make docker`.
