# Layer5-NG Site
This repository is for development of the next generation of layer5.io using Gatsby and Strapi. A persistent deployment of the site is available at https://layer5ng.netlify.app

See the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvUZy2_S1a2_14BAQIg6b9cMhUuu04kYzkOPDPaPptI/edit#) for more information and the [#websites](https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/C015QJKUMPU) channel.

## Site Development

Before building the site, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed on your system.

### Dependencies:

- [Nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [gatsby cli](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/#using-the-gatsby-cli): e.g., `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

### Building the site

Run the following:

1. `make setup-libs`-To install the dependencies for the running the site.
1. `make site`-To run the website locally.


### <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" ><img src="./assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" width="50%"/><a>
