## Layer5 Site
The Layer5 website is hosted in this repository and is built using Gatsbyjs. See the [design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvUZy2_S1a2_14BAQIg6b9cMhUuu04kYzkOPDPaPptI/edit#) for more information and the [#websites](https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/C015QJKUMPU) channel.

When submitting a pull request a preview deployment will be built and made available to you on your PR.

### Common Types of Site Updates

#### Community Member Profile ([create new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity&template=New+Member+Profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A))

Layer5 community members are an integral part of what makes Layer5 and it's projects successful. Prominently highlighting our members and their works is important. When adding a new or updating an existing community member profile, be sure to use the [Community Member Profile issue template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity&template=New+Member+Profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A), which has all the instructions needed.

#### Source code for Community Member Profiles

When adding a new or updating an existing community member profile be sure to follow the existing template which can be found here [Community Member Profile template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/master/src/collections/members/_member-profile-template). You can easily understand the template by checking out one of the profiles [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/members/abishek-kumar/index.mdx)


#### Badges for Community Members

Badges offer recognition of the efforts and works of community members.  Badges are assigned to a community member in acknowledgement of their engagement within and/or contribution to the representative project or (sub-)community. A variety of badges exist so that community members and their efforts may be affiliated with a particular project or community initiative. An example of how a badge assigned using markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/members/abishek-kumar/index.mdx), and it will be appear [this way](https://layer5.io/community/members/abishek-kumar) on a member profile.

#### <a name="updating-the-service-mesh-landscape">Updating the Service Mesh Landscape ([create new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Flandscape&template=landscape.md&title=%5BLandscape%5D))

The service mesh landscape is powered by Gatsbyjs. In order to add/update the landscape, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the **src/collections/landscape** folder. Edit these js files (if appropriate):

- [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/non-functional.js) - overview of various service meshes
- [meshes.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/meshes.js) - list of individual service mesh details
- [proxies.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/proxies.js) - list of individual modern proxies
- [gateway.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/gateways.js) - list of API gateways
- [load-balancer.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/load-balancer.js) - list of load balancers

Entries should be listed in alphabetical order. Data provided to the `smi.js` is dynamic and based upon results from conformance tests run using Meshery.

To update the Service Mesh Timeline, add the new service mesh in the [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/non-functional.js) file. Add `announce-date` key for the service mesh then add a `timeline-order` key having value 1+`maximum value of timeline-order` till now, to list the service mesh in the timeline correctly.

### <a name="commit-signing">Signing-off on Commits (Developer Certificate of Origin)</a>

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

```
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions). An example of signing off on a commit:
```
$ commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
```

To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

*~/.gitconfig*
```
[alias]
  amend = commit -s --amend
  cm = commit -s -m
  commit = commit -s
```
Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./.github/assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" ><img src="./.github/assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" width="50%"/><a>
