# How to Contribute

## Prequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your operating system before you start contributing:

- [Nodejs and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

  To verify run:

  ```
  node -v
  ```

  ```
  npm -v
  ```

- [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) 

  To verify run:

   ```
   gatsby --version
   ```

**Note:** If you're on a *Windows environment* then it is highly recommended that you install [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) both for performance and ease of use. Refer to the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/gatsby-on-wsl) for the installation of *Gatsby.js on WSL*.

## Set up your Local Development Environment

Follow the following instructions to start contributing.

  **1.** Fork [this](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5) repository.

  **2.** Clone your forked copy of the project.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/layer5io/layer5.git
  ```

  **3.** Navigate to the project directory.

  ```
  cd layer5
  ```

  **4.** Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.
  
  ```
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/layer5io/layer5.git
  ```

  **5.** Check the remotes for this repository.

  ```
  git remote -v
  ```

  **6.** Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project(updated repository).

  ```
  git pull upstream master
  ```

  **7.** Create a new branch.

  ```
  git checkout -b <your_branch_name>
  ```

  **8.** Install the dependencies for running the site.

  ```
  make setup-libs
  ```

  **9.** Make the desired changes.

  **10.** Run the site locally to preview changes.

  ```
  make site
  ```

This will run a local web server with "live reload" conveniently enabled. ( **NOTE**: while using make command on Windows, there sometimes arises an error in identifying the command even after it is installed (unrecognized command), this is because the PATH for the binary might not be set correctly ).

  **11.** Track your changes.

  ```
  git add .
  ```

  **12.** Commit your changes. To contribute to this project, you must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](#signing-off-on-commits) for each commit you make.

  ```
  git commit --signoff -m "<commit subject>"
  ```
  or you could go with the shorter format for the same, as shown below.

  ```
  git commit -s -m "<commit subject>"
  ```

  **13.** While you are working on your branch, other developers may update the `master` branch with their branch. This action means your branch is now out of date of the `master` branch and missing content. So in order to fetch the new changes, follow along:

  ```
  git checkout master
  git fetch origin master
  git merge upstream/master
  git push origin
  ```

  Now you need to merge the `master` branch into your branch. This can be done in the following way:

  ```
  git checkout <your_branch_name>
  git merge master
  ```

  **14.** Push the committed changes in your feature branch to your remote repo.

  ```
  git push -u origin <your_branch_name>
  ```

  **15.** Once you’ve committed and pushed all of your changes to GitHub, go to the page for your fork on GitHub, select your development branch, and click the pull request button. Please ensure that you compare your feature branch to the desired branch of the repo you are supposed to make a PR to. If you need to make any adjustments to your pull request, just push the updates to GitHub. Your pull request will automatically track the changes in your development branch and update it.

## Signing-off on Commits

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the **Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO)** for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) file for the full text of what you must agree to
and how it works [here](https://github.com/probot/dco#how-it-works).
To signify that you agree to the DCO for contributions, you simply add a line to each of your
git commit messages:

  ```
  Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
  ```

**Note:** you don't have to manually include this line on your commits, git does that for you as shown below:

  ```
  $ git commit -s -m “my commit message w/signoff”
  ```

In most cases, git automatically adds the signoff to your commit with the use of 
`-s` or `--signoff` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).


To ensure all your commits are signed, you may choose to add this alias to your global ```.gitconfig```:

  *~/.gitconfig*

  ```
  [alias]
    amend = commit -s --amend
    cm = commit -s -m
    commit = commit -s
  ```

Or you may configure your IDE, for example, Visual Studio Code to automatically sign-off commits for you:

<a href="./.github/assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" ><img src="./.github/assets/images/git-signoff-vscode.png" width="50%"/><a>


# Common Types of Site Updates

Two of the most common site updates that our contributors work on have been listed below.

## Updating/Creating a Community Member Profile 

Layer5 community members are an integral part of what makes Layer5 and it's projects successful. Prominently highlighting our members and their works is something that we think is important. When adding a new or updating an existing community member profile, be sure to use the [Community Member Profile issue template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity&template=New+Member+Profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A) which has all the instructions that one may need for this.
Make sure to create a [new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Fcommunity&template=New+Member+Profile.md&title=%5BCommunity%5D+Member+Profile%3A) before working on it.

### Source code for Community Member Profiles

Now that you've created a new issue, you'll need to work on the code for the same. When adding a new or updating an existing community member profile be sure to follow the existing template which can be found here [Community Member Profile template](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/tree/master/src/collections/members/_member-profile-template). You can easily understand the template by checking out one of the profiles [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/members/lee-calcote/index.mdx).

Now, our new community member profile has been created. But there are some additional accessories that the new member profile may have.
Badges are a great way of highlighting the contribution done by the community members and a good accessory for the profile.

### Badges for Community Members

A variety of badges exist so that community members and their efforts may be affiliated with a particular project or with a community initiative. An example of how a badge is assigned using markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/members/abishek-kumar/index.mdx), and it will appear [this way](https://layer5.io/community/members/abishek-kumar) on a member profile.

## Updating the Service Mesh Landscape 

Another common site update includes updation of the Service Mesh Landscape. The service mesh landscape is powered by Gatsby.js. In order to update the landscape, fork this repository, clone it, create a branch and navigate to the **src/collections/landscape** folder.

Make sure to open a [new issue](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/new?assignees=&labels=area%2Flandscape&template=landscape.md&title=%5BLandscape%5D) first. Following are a list of files that you may edit and make the neccessary updates (if appropriate):

- [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/non-functional.js) - overview of various service meshes
- [meshes.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/meshes.js) - list of individual service mesh details
- [proxies.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/proxies.js) - list of individual modern proxies
- [gateway.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/gateways.js) - list of API gateways
- [load-balancer.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/load-balancer.js) - list of load balancers

Entries should be listed in alphabetical order. Data provided to the `smi.js` is dynamic and based upon results from conformance tests run using Meshery.

To update the Service Mesh Timeline, add the new service mesh in the [non-functional.js](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/src/collections/landscape/non-functional.js) file. Add `announce-date` key for the service mesh, then add a `timeline-order` key having a value 1+`maximum value of timeline-order` till now, to list the service mesh in the timeline correctly.
