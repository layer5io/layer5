Since then, my path into the world of service meshes has brought me an avalanche of opportunities and has helped me grow by leaps and bounds as a developer.\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a standard interface that encapsulates various common service mesh functionalities. It explains several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), their configuration variables, and their corresponding effect on the service mesh underneath in full detail. What makes SMI vital is that these CRDs are generic, and the specifications are implemented and actively followed up by various service meshes. Some of these service meshes have developed adapters that define SMI CRDs as a wrapper over the APIs they already provide, instead of adhering to the SMI spec internally. SMI specifications address essential features for the most common service mesh use cases:"),o.createElement("img",{className:"image-right",src:i,alt:"smi-logo"}),o.createElement(t.ul,null,"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"Traffic policy – To apply policies like identity and transport encryption across services"),"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"Traffic telemetry – To capture key metrics like error rate and latency between services"),"\n",o.createElement(t.li,null,"Traffic management – To shift traffic between different services"),"\n"),o.createElement(t.p,null,"However, at the moment, no service meshes adhere to the SMI specifications completely.
