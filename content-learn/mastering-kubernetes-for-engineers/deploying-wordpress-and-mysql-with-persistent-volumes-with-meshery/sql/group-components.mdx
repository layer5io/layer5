<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Add Labels</h2>

To make it easier to filter and manage your resources during visualization, add labels to all of them.

You can also choose to use the existing label, `app:wordpress`, but a new one, `dev:tutorial`, is recommended for this tutorial to prevent your resources from getting mixed up with others in the public playground cluster.

1. Click on the label icon.
2. Click the **+** sign next to Labels.
3. Add the label `dev:tutorial`.
4. Do this for **all** the resources on the canvas.

<a href={wp14}>
  <img src={wp14} width="100%" align="center" />
</a>

5. Now click on `Save As` and save the design.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Group Components</h2>

The _**Group Components**_ icon on the dock below allows you to group resources based on shared labels or annotations.

This functionality aids in visualizing the relationships between various resources, making it easier to manage them, troubleshoot issues, and understand the overall cluster architecture.
