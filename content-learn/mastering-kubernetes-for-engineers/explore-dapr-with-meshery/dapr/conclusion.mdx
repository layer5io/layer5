Congratulations! You have reached the end of this course on understanding how Dapr works in a Kubernetes cluster, using Meshery as a visual guide. Throughout this course, you learned how to import Dapr, Redis, and application configuration files into Meshery and visualize the resources and their relationships.

You successfully created and configured a Dapr state store component using Meshery. You deployed the designs and visualized the deployed resources in the cluster using Operator mode. Additionally, you viewed the Dapr sidecars and observed the resources deployed in the <code>dapr-system</code> and <code>default</code> namespaces.

Finally, you streamed the logs and observed the API calls, gaining a deeper understanding of how Dapr's APIs, such as the state management API and service invocation API, work together to facilitate seamless inter-service communication and efficient management of application state.

Well done on completing this course and enhancing your knowledge of Dapr and Meshery!
