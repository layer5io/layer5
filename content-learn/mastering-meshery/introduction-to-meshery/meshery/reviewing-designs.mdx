<h1 class="chapter-sub-heading">Introduction</h1>

When working with Kanvas’ Designer Mode, collaboration is key. Design reviews allow team members to examine, provide feedback, and approve design proposals, ensuring that all components are thoroughly evaluated and potential issues are identified early. This process leads to more robust designs, informed decision-making, and a unified understanding among team members, ultimately contributing to the success of the project.

<h1 class="chapter-sub-heading">Lifecycle of Design Reviews</h1>

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Submitting Designs</h2>

This initial step involves preparing your design to be reviewed by your peers. Start by submitting your design for review, ensuring all components are accurately placed and configured. It is crucial to double-check that every aspect of the design is ready for feedback. In the context of Kanvas, you can submit designs for review by:

* **Ensuring Collaboration is Enabled:** Make sure that [collaboration](https://docs.layer5.io/kanvas/designer/share-resource/#granting-access-for-teams-upcoming-feature) mode is turned on within Kanvas so that your team members can access and review the design.  
* **Having the Design in the Same Workspace/Team:** Place your design in a [workspace or team](https://docs.layer5.io/kanvas/designer/share-resource/#granting-access-for-teams-upcoming-feature) where other members have access. This ensures that all relevant team members can easily find and review the design. Kanvas allows you to manage design access permissions and visibility, ensuring that only the intended collaborators can view and edit the design.
* **Sharing the Design Link:** Generate and share a link to your design with your team members. This direct approach ensures that anyone with the link can access the design immediately. Ensure that the designs’s [visibility status](https://docs.layer5.io/kanvas/designer/share-resource/#visibility) is set appropriately (Private, Public, or Published) based on who you want to have access.
    1. **Private:**  Only you, the creator, and the user or team with granted access permission can view and edit the design.
    2. **Public:** Anyone within your organization can view, comment on, and edit the design. You can still restrict permissions for individual users or teams.
    3. **Published:** The design becomes discoverable to other Meshery users, allowing them to view, download, and clone the design.

By following these steps, you can effectively submit your designs for review within Kanvas, ensuring that they are accessible to the right team members and ready for collaborative feedback.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Reviewing Designs</h2>

Team members can review designs using comments or annotations.

<h4 class="chapter-sub-heading">Design Reviews with Comments</h4>

You can add comments in two convenient ways:

* **Commenting via the Dock:** Click on the comment icon in the dock to create a new comment, or drag and drop it anywhere on the canvas to position it.

</a>

<h4 class="chapter-sub-heading"><u>Tips for using Comments as a Design Review Tool</u></h4>

<a href={commentsAsDesignTool}>
  <img src={commentsAsDesignTool} width="100%" align="center" />
</a>

* **Initiating Threads:** You can initiate a comment thread by adding a comment. Your comment may request a design review or provide feedback on a design. Team members can reply directly to comments, creating a structured dialogue around each point of feedback for easy referencing.
* **Utilize Mentions:** Easily draw the attention of relevant team members by tagging them in your comment. To activate this, type @ in the comment box, and a list of your team members will appear. Select who you want to mention. This ensures that the right people are notified and can contribute to the discussion.
* **Enable Email Notifications:** Customize your [notification preferences](https://docs.layer5.io/cloud/identity/users/notification-preferences/) to receive emails for comments on your design. When this is enabled, you’ll be notified when comments are made on your design, you’re mentioned in a comment, or someone adds a comment to a thread you’ve previously engaged with.
* **Mute Comment Notifications:** You can also customize your notification preferences to mute email notifications for comments on your design. This can be useful if you want to temporarily pause notifications or reduce email clutter. You’ll still have access to all comments directly within Kanvas.

<a href={comments}>
  <img src={comments} width="100%" align="center" />
</a>

* **Comment on Specific Elements:** Place comments to specific components, whether it’s a shape, text, or an entire component. This specificity ensures that feedback is targeted and directly related to the part of the design under discussion.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Resolving Comments</h2>

Once the feedback has been addressed, you can mark the comment as resolved. For resolving comments, simply right click on the comment component and select the **“resolve”** comment action. It closes the comment thread and signifies that the conversation around that feedback has concluded. It helps keep the review process organized and ensures that completed discussions are neatly archived.

**View Comment History**

Even after comments are resolved, you can view the history to understand the decisions and discussions that took place. This feature is beneficial for future reference and maintaining a clear record of the review process.

<a href={commentHistory}>
  <img src={commentHistory} width="100%" align="center" />
</a>

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Reopening Comments</h2>

After a comment has been resolved, there might be situations where you need to reopen the discussion. Unresolving a comment allows you to reinitiate conversations, address additional concerns, or make further changes.

To unresolve a comment:
* Click on the comment icon at the top right of the design canvas.
* Select "resolved" from the dropdown menu. 

This will show the resolved conversations which can be reopened. This flexibility ensures that ongoing iterations and continuous improvements can be managed effectively.

<a href={reopeningComments}>

</a>

By following these steps, you can create a thorough and collaborative review process within Kanvas, ensuring that your designs are vetted comprehensively and efficiently.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Pinning and Locking Comments in Kanvas</h2>

1. <h4 class="chapter-sub-heading">Pinning of Comments</h4>

<a href={pinningComments}>
  <img src={pinningComments} width="100%" align="center" style="max-height:40rem;object-fit:contain;" />
</a>

This image illustrates the feature of pinning comments to specific nodes within Kanvas. This functionality allows users to attach a comment to a particular node, ensuring that the comment remains associated with the node regardless of its position within the design. This is particularly useful for providing context-specific feedback or instructions that should always be visible alongside the relevant component. You can take a comment icon near to a node and it automatically gets pinned to that node.

**How It Works:**

    * **Attach Comments:** When a comment is pinned to a component, it stays linked to that node. This means that no matter where the node is moved within the design, the comment will follow.
    * **Contextual Feedback:** This feature helps in maintaining the relevance of the feedback, as the comments are always displayed in relation to the specific node they refer to.
    * **Collaborative Consistency:** Ensures that all collaborators see the comments in the correct context, facilitating clearer communication and understanding.

2. <h4 class="chapter-sub-heading">Locking Comments</h4>

<a href={lockingComments}>
  <img src={lockingComments} width="100%" align="center" />
</a>

This image shows the locking and unlocking interface for nodes in Kanvas. Right-click on the node to access the “lock” option. Locking a comment ensures that it remains fixed in its position, even if the overall design pattern changes. This is useful for highlighting and securing key components of the design that should not be altered or moved during collaborative sessions.

**How It Works:**

    * **Lock Comments:** By locking a comment, you ensure that it stays in place. This can be particularly useful for critical components that form the backbone of your design.
    * **Shared Among Collaborators:** When a comment is locked, collaborators working on that design will be unable to move or reposition the locked component. This is an excellent opportunity to brainstorm suggestions for easily identifying locked components.
    * **Unlocking Comments:** Comments can be unlocked when necessary, allowing for flexibility in design adjustments. This can be done through the radial menu shown in the image, which provides options for copying, resetting styles, duplicating, deleting, and unlocking nodes.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Design Reviews with Annotations</h2>
