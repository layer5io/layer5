<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">Fault Injection using SMI in Linkerd</h2>

Application failure injection is a form of chaos engineering where we artificially increase the error rate of certain services in a microservice application to see what impact that has on the system as a whole. Traditionally, you would need to add some kind of failure injection library into your service code in order to do application failure injection. Thankfully, the service mesh gives us a way to inject application failures without needing to modify or rebuild our services at all.

<h3 class="chapter-sub-heading">
  Using SMI Traffic Split API to inject errors
</h3>

We can easily inject application failures by using the Traffic Split API of the Service Mesh Interface. This allows us to do failure injection in a way that is implementation agnostic and works across service meshes.

We will do this first by deploying a new service which only return errored responses. We will be using a simple NGINX service which has configured to only return HTTP 500 responses.

We will then create a traffic split which would redirect the service mesh to send a sample percentage of traffic to the error service instead, let's say 20% of service's traffic to error, then we would have injected an artificial 20% error rate in service.

<h3 class="chapter-sub-heading">Deploy Linkerd Books Application</h3>

We will be deploying [Linkerd Books application](https://github.com/BuoyantIO/booksapp) for this part of the demo

Use meshery to deploy the bookinfo application :

- In Meshery, navigate to the Linkerd adapter's management page from the left nav menu.
- On the Linkerd adapter's management page, please enter `default` in the `Namespace` field.
- Then, click the (+) icon on the `Sample Application` card and select `Books Application` from the list.

Inject linkerd into sample application using

```sh
linkerd inject https://run.linkerd.io/booksapp.yml | kubectl apply -f -
```

In the following, one of the service has already beeen configured with the error let's remove the error rate from the same :

```sh
kubectl edit deploy/authors
```

Remove the lines

```sh
- name: FAILURE_RATE
  value: "0.5
```

Now if you will see `linkerd stat`, the success rate would be 100%

```sh
linkerd stat deploy
```

<h3 class="chapter-sub-heading"> Create the errored service</h3>

Now we will create our error service, we have NGINX pre-configured to only respond with HTTP 500 status code

```sh
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: error-injector
  labels:
    app: error-injector
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: error-injector
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: error-injector
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:alpine
          ports:
          - containerPort: 80
            name: nginx
            protocol: TCP
          volumeMounts:
            - name: nginx-config
              mountPath: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
              subPath: nginx.conf
      volumes:
        - name: nginx-config
          configMap:
            name: error-injector-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: error-injector
  name: error-injector
spec:
  clusterIP: None
  ports:
  - name: service
    port: 7002
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: nginx
  selector:
    app: error-injector
  type: ClusterIP
---
apiVersion: v1
data:
 nginx.conf: |2

    events {
        worker_connections  1024;
    }

    http {
        server {
            location / {
                return 500;
            }
        }
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: error-injector-config
```

After deploying the above errored service, we will create a traffic split resource which will be responsible to direct 20% of the book service to the error.

```sh
apiVersion: split.smi-spec.io/v1alpha3
kind: TrafficSplit
metadata:
  name: fault-inject
spec:
  service: books
  backends:
  - service: books
    weight: 800m
  - service: error-injector
    weight: 200m
```

You can now see an 20% error rate for calls from webapp to books

```sh
linkerd routes deploy/webapp --to service/books
```

You can also see the error on the web browser

```sh
kubectl port-forward deploy/webapp 7000 && open http://localhost:7000
```

If you refresh page few times, you will see `Internal Server Error`.

<h3 class="chapter-alt-heading">Cleanup</h3>

```sh
kubectl delete trafficsplit/error-split
```

- Remove the book info application from the `Meshery Dashboard` by clicking on the `trash icon` in the `sample application` card on the linkerd adapters' page.
