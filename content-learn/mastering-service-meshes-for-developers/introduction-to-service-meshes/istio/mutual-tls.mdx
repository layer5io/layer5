Istio provides transparent mutual TLS to services inside the service mesh where both the client and the server authenticate each others' certificates as part of the TLS handshake. As part of this course, we have deployed Istio with mTLS.

By default istio sets mTLS in `PERMISSIVE` mode which allows plain text traffic to be sent and accepted by a mesh. We first disallow plain text traffic using `PeerAuthentication` and setting mTLS mode to STRICT.

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading"> Confirm mTLS is being enforced</h2>

This can be easily done by executing a simple command:-

```sh
kubectl get peerauthentication --all-namespaces
```

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading"> Verify mTLS</h2>

Citadel is Istioâ€™s key management service. As a first step, confirm that Citadel is up and running:

```sh
kubectl get deploy -l istio=citadel -n istio-system
```

Output will be similar to:

```
NAME            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
istio-citadel   1/1     1            1           3m23s
```

To experiment with mTLS, let's do so by logging into the sidecar proxy of the `productpage` pod by executing this command:

```sh
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pod | grep productpage | awk '{ print $1 }') -c istio-proxy -- /bin/bash
```

We are now in the proxy of the `productpage` pod. Check that all the ceritificates are loaded in this proxy:

```sh
ls /etc/certs/
```

You should see 3 entries:

```sh
cert-chain.pem  key.pem  root-cert.pem
```

Now, try to make a curl call to the `details` service over HTTP:

```sh
curl http://details:9080/details/0
```

Since, we have TLS between the sidecar's, an HTTP call will not work. The request will timeout. You will see an error like the one below:

```sh
curl: (7) Failed to connect to details port 9080: Connection timed out
```

Let us try to make a curl call to the details service over HTTPS but **WITHOUT** certs:

```sh
curl https://details:9080/details/0 -k
```

The request will be denied and you will see an error like the one below:

```sh
curl: (16) SSL_write() returned SYSCALL, errno = 104
```

Now, let us use curl over HTTPS with certificates to the details service:

```sh
curl https://details:9080/details/0 -v --key /etc/certs/key.pem --cert /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem --cacert /etc/certs/root-cert.pem -k
```

Output will be similar to this:

```sh
*   Trying 10.107.35.26...
* Connected to details (10.107.35.26) port 9080 (#0)

```

This proves the existence of mTLS between the services on the Istio mesh.

Now lets come out of the container before we go to the next section:

```sh
exit
```

<h2 class="chapter-sub-heading">
  Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone (SPIFFE)
</h2>
<br />
Istio uses [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/) to assert the identify of workloads on
the cluster. SPIFFE consists of a notion of identity and a method of proving it.
A SPIFFE identity consists of an authority part and a path. The meaning of the
path in spiffe land is implementation defined. In k8s it takes the form
`/ns/$namespace/sa/$service-account` with the expected meaning. A SPIFFE
identify is embedded in a document. This document in principle can take many
forms but currently the only defined format is x509.

To start our investigation, let us check if the certs are in place in the productpage sidecar:

```sh
kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=productpage -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- ls /etc/certs
```

Output will be similar to:

```sh
cert-chain.pem
key.pem
root-cert.pem
```

Mac users, MacOS should have openssl available. If your machine does not have openssl install, install it using your preferred method.

Here is one way to install it on RHEL or CentOS or its derivatives:

```sh
sudo yum install -y openssl-devel
```

Here is one way to install it on Ubuntu or Debian or its derivatives:

```sh
sudo apt install -y libssl-dev
```

Now that we have found the certs, let us verify the certificate of productpage sidecar by running this command:

```sh
kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=productpage -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- cat /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem | openssl x509 -text -noout  | grep Validity -A 2
```

Output will be similar to:

```sh
    Not Before: Sep 23 17:32:28 2019 GMT
    Not After : Dec 22 17:32:28 2019 GMT
```

Lets also verify the URI SAN:

```sh
kubectl exec $(kubectl get pod -l app=productpage -o jsonpath={.items..metadata.name}) -c istio-proxy -- cat /etc/certs/cert-chain.pem | openssl x509 -text -noout  | grep 'Subject Alternative Name' -A 1
```

Output will be similar to:

```sh
X509v3 Subject Alternative Name: critical
    URI:spiffe://cluster.local/ns/default/sa/bookinfo-productpage
```
