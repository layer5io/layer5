The pods are run here, so the worker node contains all the necessary services to manage the networking between the containers, communicate with the master node, and assign resources to the containers scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kubelet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubelet ensures that all containers in the node are running and are in a healthy state.  If a node fails, a replication controller observes this change and launches pods on another healthy pod. Integrated into the kubelet binary is ‘cAdvisor` that auto-discovers all containers and collects CPU, memory, file system, and network usage statistics and also provides machine usage stats by analyzing the ‘root’ container. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubelet gets the configuration of a pod from the apiserver and ensures that the described containers are up and running. This is the worker service that’s responsible for communicating with the master node. It also communicates with etcd, to get information about services and write the details about newly created ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kube Proxy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kube Proxy acts as a network proxy and a load balancer for a service on a single worker node. . It takes care of the network routing for TCP and UDP packets. It forwards the request to the correct pods across isolated networks in a cluster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pod is the basic building block on Kubernetes. It represents the workloads that get deployed. Pods are generally collections of related containers, but a pod may also only have one container. A pod shares network/storage and also a specification for how to run the containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Containers are the lowest level of microservice. These are placed inside of the pods and need external IP addresses to view any outside processes. Docker is not the only supported container runtime, but is by far, the most popular. Docker runs on each of the worker nodes, and runs the configured pods. It takes care of downloading the images and starting the containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;kubectl&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubectl is a command line tool to communicate with the API service and send commands to the master node. kubectl must be configured to communicate with your cluster. If you have multiple clusters, you might try using kubectx, which makes switching between contexts easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Managing objects with kubectl&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can divide a Kubernetes cluster into multiple environments by using namespaces (e.g., Dev1, Dev2, QA1, QA2, etc.), and each environment can be managed by a different user. One of the inconveniences of writing kubectl commands is that every time you write a command, you need the --namespace option at the end. People often forget this and end up creating objects (pods, services, deployments) in the wrong namespace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this trick, you can set the namespace preference before running kubectl commands. Run the following command before executing the kubectl commands, and it will save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands for your current context:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=mynamespace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is Multi-Cluster Kubernetes?]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

So these ports will be used for all the internal Istio communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ingress Gateway Deployment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a wrapper around the Envoy proxy and it is configured as the sidecars used inside the service mesh. When a Gateway or VirtualService gets changed, they are detected by the Istio Pilot controller and converts this information to an Envoy configuration and sends it to all the proxies, including the Envoy inside the IngressGateway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since container ports are not supposed to be declared in Kubernetes pods, we don&amp;#x27;t have to declare the ports in the Ingress Gateway Deployment. If we look inside the deployment we can see that there are a number of ports that are already declared anyway. We have to take care about the Ingress Gateway Deployment in SSL certificates. To access the certificates inside the Gateway resources, make sure that we have mounted all the required certificates properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-yaml&quot;

At their core, service meshes provide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A services-first network; A developer-driven network;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A network that is primarily concerned with alleviating application developers from building infrastructure concerns into their application code; A network that empowers operators with the ability to declaratively define network behavior, node identity, and traffic flow through policy;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A network that enables service owners to control application logic without engaging developers to change its code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value derived from the layer of tooling that service meshes provide is most evident in the land of microservices. The more services, the more value derived from the mesh. In subsequent chapters, I show how service meshes provide value outside of the use of microservices and containers and help modernize existing services (running on virtual or bare metal servers) as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 cwuCUo accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 hlOIub accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 ilNMiK&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-5&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-5&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jCBZFW&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;When should I adopt a service mesh?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__OpenIcon-sc-zq6yo-2 eqQQKC&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 217.9L383 345c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0 9.4-9.4 9.3-24.6 0-34L273 167c-9.1-9.1-23.7-9.3-33.1-.7L95 310.9c-4.7 4.7-7 10.9-7 17s2.3 12.3 7 17c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0l127.1-127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__CloseIcon-sc-zq6yo-3 fVIWdl&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 294.1L383 167c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0s9.3 24.6 0 34L273 345c-9.1 9.1-23.7 9.3-33.1.7L95 201.1c-4.7-4.7-7-10.9-7-17s2.3-12.3 7-17c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l127.1 127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemPanel&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionBodyWrapper-sc-zq6yo-6 llPzmQ accordion__body&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-5&quot; hidden=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many service meshes to choose from as well as a variety of deployment models.

We expect earnest effort from its contributors. What “earnest effort” means is different for each community member as all have different circumstances. Suffice to say, the more you put into your efforts, the greater your reward will be. Most community contributors stay with the project for many months, if not indefinitely. Length of involvement is entirely up to the individual community member. You can expect to be challenged, to be assisted, to learn, to be recognized for your effort and to have your contributions appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Layer5 community, you are expected to be a good representative of Layer5&amp;#x27;s cultures and values of helping fellow members and paying it forward as we all learn together. You are expected to offer your ideas and skills to help advance our community and its projects. You are expected to share your experiences with others, to be curious, to be helpful, to ask questions, to challenge others and to be challenged yourself, to spread the word about what we collectively do here, to invite new members, to learn, to share, to make friends, to build a network, to write blog posts, to tweet, to become maintainers, to become MeshMates, to earn an internship, to get hired by Layer5 - - any and all of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/community/meshmates&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 klVCbA appion__btn faqbutton&quot; title=&quot;Reach out to a MeshMate to find out more&quot;&gt; Reach out to a MeshMate to find out more&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 cwuCUo accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 hlOIub accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 ilNMiK&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-14&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-14&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jCBZFW&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;I see works of other contributors being highlighted.

Start contributing and keep contributing. Community members who consistently contribute are the first individuals to be awarded internships when new internship opportunities open up - particularly members who are making significantly impactful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand that internships are assigned as a recognition of work that you are already performing. They are not assigned in the hopes of you becoming a good contributor, but are awarded to support and reinforce efforts that you are already giving. Engage and make an impact on an area of a project. Show your passion for helping move the project forward, willingness to work hard, and capacity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognize that there are many hundreds of contributors and relatively few maintainers and MeshMates.

You can also utilise various algorithms, such as a fixed or sliding window, a sliding log, etc. The purpose of rate limits is to ensure that your services are not oversubscribed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a limit is reached, well-implemented services commonly adhere to IETF RFC 6585, sending 429 Too Many Requests as the response code, including headers, such as the following, describing the request limit, number of requests remaining, and amount of time remaining until the request counter is reset:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact-left&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-RateLimit-Limit: 60&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X-RateLimit-Reset: 1372016266&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quota management&lt;/strong&gt; (or conditional rate-limiting) accounts for requests based on business requirements instead of limiting rates based on operational concerns. It can be difficult to tell the difference between rate limiting and quota management because both features are handled by the same service mesh capability but are exposed to users in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuring a policy setting a threshold for the number of client requests allowed to a service over time is the canonical example of quota management. User Lee, for example, is on the Free service plan and is allowed upto 10 requests per day. Quota policy imposes consumption limitations on services by keeping track of incoming requests in a distributed counter,often using an in-memory datastore like Redis  Conditional rate limits are a powerful service mesh capability when applied based on a user-defined set of arbitrary attributes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure4-42e3faa6d38a8c21b7584ee807ee0dec.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Communication Paths&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 4: An example of service mesh architecture. Secure communication paths in Istio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For securing service-to-service communication, most service meshes include a certificate authority that manages keys and certificates. Certificates are generated for each service and serve as the service&amp;#x27;s unique identifier. When sidecar proxies are employed, they assume the identity of the service and perform lifecycle management of certificates (creation, distribution, refresh, and revocation) on its behalf.   Local TCP connections are often established between the service and the sidecar proxy, whereas mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) connections are typically established between proxies in sidecar proxy deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internal traffic within your application should be encrypted as a matter of security. The service calls in your application are no longer contained within a single monolith via localhost; they are now exposed over the network. Allowing service calls without TLS on the transport is a recipe for disaster in terms of security. When two mesh-enabled services communicate, they have strong cryptographic proof of their peers.   After identities have been established, they are used to create access control policies that determine whether or not a request should be serviced. Policy controls configuration of the key management system (e.g., certificate refresh interval) and operational access control are used to determine whether a request is accepted, based on service mesh employed. Approved and unapproved connection requests, as well as more granular access control parameters like time of day, are identified using white and blacklists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Delay and fault injection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s important to accept that your networks and/or systems will fail. Why not introduce failure and verify behaviour ahead of time? As proxies sit in line to service traffic, they frequently support protocol-specific fault injection, which allows you to configure the percentage of requests that should be subjected to faults or network delays. For example, generating HTTP 500 errors might be used to test the robustness of your distributed application&amp;#x27;s response behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injecting latency into requests without a service mesh is a time-consuming procedure, but it is probably a more prevalent problem encountered during  operation of an application. Users are far more irritated by slow replies that result in an HTTP 503 after a minute of waiting than by a 503 after a few seconds. The finest element of these resilience testing capabilities is that no application code needs to be changed to make these tests possible. The results of the tests, on the other hand, may prompt you to make changes to the application code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a service mesh, developers spend far less time creating code to cope with infrastructure issues—code that could be commoditized by service meshes in the future. The separation of service and session-layer concerns from application code is manifested as a phenomenon I refer to as decoupling at Layer 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh can be regarded of as surfacing the OSI model&amp;#x27;s session layer as a separately addressable, first-class citizen in your modern architecture. They are a secret weapon of cloud native systems, waiting to be exploited as a highly configurable work horse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Swappable Sidecars]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

Why is this phenomenon required? We&amp;#x27;ll look to the microservices and containers movement for service meshes, a cloud-native approach to design scalable, independently supplied services. What was previously internal application communications have become a mesh of service-to-service remote procedure calls (RPCs) transported via networks thanks to microservices. Microservices democratize language and technology choice across independent service teams that generate new features quickly as they iteratively and continuously provide software(typically as a service). The most crucial driver of microservices as an architectural model is the decoupling of engineering teams and their enhanced speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Operating Many Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial couple of microservices are relatively simple to deliver and operate—at least in comparison to organizations&amp;#x27; challenges when they first use many microservices. Whether that &amp;quot;many&amp;quot; is three or one hundred, a major technological issue will inevitably arise. To relieve microservices headaches, several remedies are prescribed; one notable example is the use of client libraries. In microservices environments, language and framework-specific client libraries, whether pre-existing or generated, are utilized to address distributed systems challenges. Many teams first explore their path to a service mesh in these situations. The sheer volume of services that must be managed on an individual, distributed basis (rather than centrally as with monoliths) and the challenges of ensuring their reliability, observability, and security cannot be met with outmoded paradigms, necessitating the need to reincarnate prior thinking and approaches. It is necessary to adapt new tools and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since microservices are distributed (often ephemeral) by nature, and the network is critical to their functioning, we should consider the fallacy that networks are reliable, have no latency, have infinite bandwidth, and that communication is guaranteed. When you consider how important it is to be able to control and secure service communication in distributed systems that rely on network calls with every transaction, every time an application is invoked, you can see why you are under tooled and why running more than a few microservices on a network topology that is in constant flux is so difficult. In the age of microservices, a new layer of tooling for the caretaking of services is needed—a service mesh is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Is a Service Mesh?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service meshes provide intent-based networking for microservices describing desired behavior of the network in the face of constantly changing conditions and network topology. At their core, service meshes provide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A services-first network;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A developer-driven network;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A network that is primarily concerned with alleviating application developers from building infrastructure concerns into their application code; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A network that empowers operators with the ability to declaratively define network behavior, node identity, and traffic flow through policy; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A network that enables service owners to control application logic without engaging developers to change its code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value derived from the layer of tooling that service meshes provide is most evident in the land of microservices. The more services, the more value derived from the mesh. In subsequent chapters, I show how service meshes provide value outside of the use of microservices and containers and help modernize existing services (running on virtual or bare metal servers) as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of you will find yourself working in organizations that have more than one sort of service mesh. Diversity is driven by a broad set of workload requirements varying from process-based to event-driven in their design, from those running on bare metal to executing in functions and those representing every style of deployment artifact in-between. The scope of service mesh capability required by different organizations varies. As a result, different service meshes are created with slightly different use cases in mind, resulting in differences in service mesh architecture and deployment models. Service meshes, which are driven by Cloud, Hybrid, On-Prem, and Edge, can enable each of these. With the requirements of different edge devices and their functions, along with ephemeral cloud-based workloads, microservice patterns and technologies give a plethora of opportunities for service mesh differentiation and specialization. Cloud vendors produce and collaborate as they provide service mesh as a managed service on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure1-624b7da78797752b7cf79ce222606415.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;comparative spectrum&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 1: A comparative spectrum of the difference between some of the service meshes based on their individual strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand for service meshes, including meshes native to specific cloud platforms, is growing in tandem with the number of microservices. As a result, many enterprises now use various service mesh products, either separately or together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Abstractions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because there are any number of service meshes available, independent specifications have cropped up to provide abstraction and standardization across them. Three service mesh abstractions exist today:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; (SMP) is a format for describing and capturing service mesh performance. Created by Layer5; Meshery is the canonical implementation of this specification.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) is a set of API standards for enabling service mesh federation. Created by VMware.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface&lt;/a&gt; (SMI) is a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. Created by Microsoft; Meshery is the official SMI conformance tool used to ensure that a cluster is properly configured and that its behavior conforms to official SMI specifications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Landscape&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s start characterizing different service meshes now that we better understand why we live in a multi-mesh world. Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads (services operating on a VM or on bare metal), while others specialize in layering on top of container orchestrators, such as Kubernetes. All service meshes support integration with service discovery systems. The subsections that follow provide a very brief survey of service mesh offerings within the current technology landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact-left&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;See the Layer5 &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-landscape&quot;&gt;service mesh landscape&lt;/a&gt; for a comprehensive overview and characterizing of all of the service meshes, service proxies, and related tools available today. This landscape is community-maintained and places service meshes in contrast with one another so that the reader might make the most informed decision about which service mesh best suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Do I Need One?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have a container orchestrator; why do I need another infrastructure layer?&amp;quot; you might wonder.

We’ll see that control and data planes of service meshes are not necessarily tightly coupled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure2-1a9f1b412652dfd917052e9ac2854c73.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Mesh Topology&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Mesh topology—fully connected network nodes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Physical network topologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star, spoke-and-hub, tree (also called hierarchical), and mesh are some of the most used physical networking topologies. Nodes in mesh networks connect directly and non-hierarchically, such that each node is connected to an indefinite number (typically as many as possible or as needed dynamically) of neighbour nodes, allowing at least one path from a given node to any other node to route data efficiently .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireless is the canonical use case for physical mesh networks in which the networking medium is sensitive to line-of-sight, weather-induced, or other disruptions, and so reliability is a top priority. Mesh networks typically self-configure, allowing dynamic task distribution. This ability is especially important to mitigate the risk of failure (improving resiliency) and reacting to continuously changing topologies. It&amp;#x27;s easy to see why this network topology is the preferred design for service mesh architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service mesh network planes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh architectures typically employ the same three networking planes: data, control, and management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure3-58e1728df81b55a288fc15de629455ce.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Service mesh architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 3: An example of service mesh architecture. In Conduit’s architecture, control and data planes divide in-band and out-of-band responsibility for service traffic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh data plane (also known as the proxying layer) intercepts all packets in a request and performs health checks, routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, and generation of observable signals. Service proxies are transparently inserted, and applications are oblivious of the data plane&amp;#x27;s existence when they conduct service-to-service calls. Intra-service communication, as well as inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) service mesh traffic, are handled by data planes. Whether traffic is entering the mesh (ingressing) or leaving the mesh (egressing), application service traffic is directed first to the service proxy for handling prior to sending (or not sending) along to the application.  Traffic is transparently intercepted and redirected to the service proxy in order to reroute traffic from the service proxy to the service application. The service proxy intercepts and redirects traffic between the service proxy and service application places the service application’s container onto a network it would otherwise not be on. All traffic to and from the service application is seen by the service proxy.  Service proxies are the building blocks of service mesh data planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Traffic Interception and Redirection:&lt;p&gt;The technology utilised to intercept and redirect traffic varies between service meshes. Some meshes allow you the option of using iptables, IPVS, or eBPF to transparently proxy requests between clients and service applications. Other service mesh proxies operate in a less transparent manner, requiring application traffic to be configured to direct their traffic to the proxy. The operating system type and kernel version used for the service mesh deployment are constrained by the choice of each of these technologies, which influences the speed with which packets are processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy is one of the most widely used proxy in service mesh data planes. It&amp;#x27;s also common to see it deployed as a load balancer or ingress gateway. The proxies used in service mesh data planes are highly intelligent.  In order to manipulate network packets (including application level data), they may include any number of protocol-specific filters . Extending data plane capabilities with technology advancements like WebAssembly allows service meshes to inject additional logic into requests while simultaneously handling large traffic loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the number of proxies becomes unmanageable or when a single point of visibility and control is required, a service mesh control plane is essential. Control planes offer policy and configuration for the services in the mesh, transforming a set of isolated, stateless proxies into a service mesh. Control planes run out-of-band and do not directly touch any network packets in the mesh. Control planes usually include a command-line interface (CLI) and a user interface to interact with, both of which provide access to a centralised API for regulating proxy behaviour holistically. You can use the control plane&amp;#x27;s APIs to automate changes to its configuration (for example, using a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline), where configuration is generally version controlled and updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Proxies are generally considered stateless, but this is a thought-provoking concept. In the way in which proxies are generally informed by the control plane of the presence of services, mesh topology updates, traffic and authorization policy, and so on, proxies cache the state of the mesh but aren’t regarded as the source of truth for the state of the mesh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see how the data and control planes are packaged and deployed in Linkerd (pronounced &amp;quot;linker-dee&amp;quot;) and Istio (pronounced &amp;quot;Ist-tee-oh&amp;quot;), two prominent open source service meshes. In terms of packaging, Linkerdv1 contains both its proxying components (linkerd) and its control plane (namerd) packaged together simply as “Linkerd,” and Istio brings a collection of control plane components (Galley, Pilot, and Citadel) to pair by default with Envoy (a data plane) packaged together as “Istio.” Envoy is often labeled a service mesh, inappropriately so, because it takes packaging with a control plane to form a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh management plane is a higher order level of control as shown in Figure 4. A management plane may provide a variety of functions. As such, implementations vary in their functionality: some focusing on orchestrating service meshes (e.g., service mesh lifecycle management) and mesh federation, providing insight across a collection of diverse meshes. Some management planes focus on integrating service meshes with business process and policy, including governance, compliance, validation of configuration, and extensible access control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure4-b3eeda7dcac8dcf72d83a4cc33156ded.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Meshery&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 4: Meshery, the cloud native management plane’s architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh management plane is a higher order level of control. A management plane can provide various functions. As a result, implementations differ in functionality, with some focused on orchestrating service meshes (e.g., service mesh lifecycle management) and mesh federation, which provides insight across a set of meshes. Some management planes focus on integrating service meshes with business process and policy, including governance, compliance, validation of configuration, and extensible access control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of deployments, data planes, such as Linkerdv2, contain proxies that are created as part of the project and are not designed to be configured by hand, but rather to have their behaviour completely controlled by the control plane. Other service meshes, such as Istio, prefer not to develop their own proxy and instead ingest and utilise independent proxies (separate projects), simplifying proxy selection and deployment outside of the mesh(standalone). Control planes are often deployed in a separate &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; namespace, using Kubernetes as the example infrastructure. Depending on how closely they integrate with non-containerized workloads and a business&amp;#x27;s backend systems, management planes are deployed both on and off cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Network Planes]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

The infrastructure and practices by which your software is continuously deployed and operated — your application delivery — is the fulcrum of your organization’s digital transformation. Likely you are progressing on your cloud native journey — that is, transitioning from monolithic to container-based microservices architectures with the goal of achieving agility, portability, and on-demand scalability. Kubernetes is the platform of choice for many, providing the automation and control necessary to manage microservices-based applications at scale and with high velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the network part and parcel to each and every service request in your microservices-based application, it may come as no surprise that at the core of application delivery is your application delivery controller, an intelligent proxy that accelerates and manages application delivery. With no standard definition of what an application delivery controller does, the capabilities of intelligent proxies vary broadly.

To help facilitate a general understanding, we’ve grouped some roles when responsibilities overlap across multiple teams:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Platform&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform teams are responsible for deploying and managing their Kubernetes infrastructure. They are responsible for platform governance, operational efficiency, and developer agility. The platform team is the connective tissue among various teams like DevOps, SREs, developers, and network operations teams and therefore must address and balance the unique needs of a diverse group of stakeholders, or influencers, when choosing cloud native solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DevOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DevOps teams are responsible for continuously deploying applications. They care about faster development and release cycles, CI/CD and automation, and canary and progressive rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SREs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site reliability engineers must ensure application availability. They care about observability, incident response, and postmortems. SREs often act as architects for DevOps team and as such are often extensions of or directly belong to DevOps teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development teams are responsible for application performance and are focused on ensuring a seamless end-user experience, including troubleshooting and microservices discovery and routing. Application performance and troubleshooting is shared responsibility among multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NetOps &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network operations teams are responsible for ensuring stable, high-performing network connectivity, resiliency, security (e.g. web application firewalls and TLS), and are commonly focused on north-south traffic. They care about establishing networking policies and enforcing compliance; achieving management, control, and monitoring of the network; and gaining visibility for the purpose of resources and capacity planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DevSecOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DevSecOps teams care about ensuring a strong security posture and rely on automated tools to orchestrate security for infrastructure, applications, containers, and API gateways. DevSecOps works very closley with NetOps team for holistic secure posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure1-6657bcb989b9255c6f56776e21b2b9ee.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Diverse Stakeholders have different needs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each role has nuanced responsibilities. Whether you have a single person or teams of people assigned to these roles, each role’s function needs to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that these stakeholders are undergoing a transformation in their responsibilities — or at least a transformation in the way in which they perform their responsibilities. Depending upon your organization’s size and structure, your stakeholders may have clearly defined lines of accountability or not among roles. As you adopt a cloud native approach to application deployment and delivery, you may find that the once-defined lines have blurred or that they are being redrawn. Be aware that the individuals who fill these roles typically go through a period of adjustment that can be unsettling until they adapt to their own and their teams’ new identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your cloud native infrastructure should be as accommodating as possible to you, your team, and your collective responsibilities and process, so we encourage you to seek solutions that address the needs of all your stakeholders. Significantly, this includes evaluating different architectural models for as best fit for purpose. While every organization doesn’t travel the same road to cloud native, every journey starts with initial architectural decisions – decisions which have substantial bearing on your path to cloud native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Architecting Your Foundation the Right Way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud native novices and experts alike find that designing their application delivery architectures is the most challenging part of building microservices. Your architectural choices will have a significant impact on your cloud native journey. Some architectures will provide greater or fewer benefits while others will prove less or more difficult to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a cloud native pro or a novice, your selection of the right application delivery architecture will be one that balances the tradeoff between the greatest benefits and the simplicity needed to match your team’s skill set. Figure 1 highlights four common application delivery architecture deployment models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Graph1-922f70168e5eac45ea8da896ca6e827d.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Tip: Traffic Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;North-south (N-S) traffic refers to traffic between clients outside the Kubernetes cluster and services inside the cluster, while east-west (E-W) traffic refers to traffic between services inside the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the deployment models in Figure 1 come with their list of pros and cons and are typically the point of focus of different teams. So how do you choose the right architecture for your deployment? Given the needs of your stakeholders and the many specifics involved in managing both north-south (N-S) and east-west (E-W) traffic, it is critical to assess the four different architectures with respect to the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application security &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observability &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuous deployment &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scalability and performance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open source tools integration &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Service mesh &amp;amp; Istio  integration &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IT skill set required &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine each of the four deployment models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Two-Tier Ingress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-two-tier-ingress-5c271192e7c2aec7e0cc115d2796f66e.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; alt=&quot;Two Tier Ingress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-tier ingress is the simplest architectural model to deploy to get teams up and running quickly. In this deployment model, Tthere are two layers of ADCs for N-S traffic ingress. The external ADC (at Tier 1), shown in green in Figure 2, provides L4 traffic management. Frequently, additional services are assigned to this ADC and can include web application firewall (WAF) and, secure sockets layer/transport layer security offload (SSL/TLS) functionality and authentication. A two-tier ingress deployment model is often managed by the existing network team (which is familiar with internet-facing traffic), and it can also be used as an ADC for other existing applications simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second ADC (Tier 2), shown in yellow in Figure 2, handles L7 load balancing for N-S traffic. It is managed by the platform team and is used within the Kubernetes cluster to direct traffic to the correct node. Layer 7 attributes, like information in the URL and HTTP headers, can be used for traffic load-balancing decisions. The yellow ADC continuously receives updates about the availability and respective IP addresses of the microservices pods within the Kubernetes cluster and can make decisions about which pod is best able to handle the request. Deployed as a container inside the Kubernetes cluster, the yellow ADC can be deployed as a container with Citrix CPX or with another similar product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The E-W traffic between microservices pods is managed by kube-proxy, an open source, basic L4 load balancer with simple IP address-based round robin or least connection algorithm. kube-proxy lacks advanced features like Layer 7 load balancing, security, and observability, making it a blind spot for E-W traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros of Two-Tier Ingress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the right proxy, SSL termination can be done at the edge, and traffic can be inspected easily. This enables N-S traffic to be comprehensively secured across L3-7. ADC collects and reports telemetry on the N-S application traffic it sees, which means that this architecture provides robust observability for N-S traffic. ADC can also also integrate with CI/CD tools like Spinnaker to provide traffic management to N-S traffic for excellent continuous deployment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-tier ingress scales very well for N-S traffic, as an example Citrix ADC reach hundreds of Gbps or even Tbps throughput through active-active clustering of ADCs if required. Integration with third-party tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Zipkin are supported out of the box with ADC, so you can continue to use the tools with which you are familiar to collect data and manage your systems for N-S traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bifurcated design of two-tier ingress makes it relatively simple to implement demarcation points for control. The network team can own and manage the green ADC, and the platform team can work inside the Kubernetes environment. Neither the network team nor the platform team needs extensive retraining, which makes this architecture quick to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons of Two-Tier Ingress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations of kube-proxy have made the use of third-party tools like Project Calico necessary to provide network policies, segmentation, and security support for inter-microservices communication. Similarly, kube-proxy&amp;#x27;s lack of detailed telemetry capabilities provides very little observability for E-W traffic. kube-proxy does not have the extensive APIs to integrate with continuous deployment tools, and its basic round-robin load balancing does not provide the granular load balancing needed to incorporate a CI/CD strategy inside the cluster. In general so you lack advanced load balancing tool set required to manage your inter-pod traffic. And kube-proxy does not currently integrate with service meshes, so there is no open source control plane integration for your E-W traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, two-tier ingress provides excellent services for N-S traffic but lacks control for E-W traffic. It is a popular architecture because it is simple to implement and is frequently a starting point for enterprises on their cloud native journey to microservices adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;By default, kube-proxy uses iptables (x_tables kernel modules), so it does not perform as well as other proxies. You can configure kube-proxy to run in different modes by setting the --proxy-mode flag. Setting this flag to ipvs enables IPVS mode (netfilter kernel modules), which provides a much improved performance and also enables choice of load balancing algorithm through the --ipvs-scheduler parameter beyond the default round robin algorithm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unified Ingress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-unified-ingress-e24b73fc8f6ed89ecae0a73a8483f8d8.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Unified Ingress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unified ingress is very similar to the two-tier ingress architecture, except that it unifies two tiers of application delivery controllers (ADCs) for N-S traffic into one. Reducing an ADC tier effectively removes one hop of latency for N-S traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unified ingress has the same benefits and drawbacks as the two-tier ingress proxy architecture for security, observability, continuous deployment, scale and performance, open source tools support, and service mesh integration. Where it differs is in the skill sets required for implementation. With unified ingress, both the ADCs for N-S traffic and kube-proxy for the E-W traffic are managed by the platform team, who must be very network savvy to implement and manage this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unified ingress proxy architecture is capable of participating in the Kubernetes cluster’s overlay network. This allows it to communicate directly with the microservices pods. Therefore, the platform team has to be knowledgeable about layers 3-7 of the network stack to take full advantage of this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, unified ingress proxy architecture is moderately simple to deploy compared to service mesh (which we will cover next), and it offers robust capabilities for N-S traffic, but has very limited functionality for E-W traffic due to the limitations of kube-proxy. A network-savvy platform team is key for implementing this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer to control how different parts of an application communicate with one another with one another. The service mesh landscape has exploded because service meshes offer the best observability, security, and fine-grained management for traffic among microservices — that is, for E-W traffic. As an additional layer of infrastructure, service meshes do bear additional complexity as a tradeoff to the value they provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-service-mesh-9424773542766dde1581086f1363a84b.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; alt=&quot;Service Mesh&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical service mesh architecture is similar to the two-tier ingress proxy architecture for N-S traffic and offers the same rich benefits for N-S traffic. The key difference between service mesh and two-tier ingress, and where most of the value lies, is that service mesh employs a lightweight proxy as a sidecar to each microservice pod for E-W traffic. Microservices do not communicate directly: Communication among microservices happens via the sidecar, which enables inter-pod traffic to be inspected and managed as it enters and leaves the pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using proxy sidecars, service mesh offers the highest levels of observability, security, and fine-grained traffic management and control among microservices. Additionally, select repetitive microservice functions like retries and encryption can be offloaded to the sidecars. Despite each sidecar’s being assigned its own memory and CPU resources, sidecars are typically lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the option to use Citrix CPX as a sidecar. Sidecars, which are managed by the platform team and attached to each pod, create a highly scalable, distributed architecture, but they also add complexity because they result in more moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of Service Mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantages of service mesh for N-S traffic are similar to those for two-tier ingress. Service mesh, however, brings added advantages for E-W traffic.The presence of sidecars enables you to set security policies and control communication among your microservices. You can mandate things like authentication, encryption, and rate limiting for APIs among microservices if required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because E-W traffic is seen by the sidecars, there is much more telemetry to provide holistic observability for better insights and improved troubleshooting. Furthermore, Citrix CPX as a sidecar has well-defined APIs that integrate with myriad open source tools, so that you can use the observability tools you&amp;#x27;re used to. Sidecar APIs allow integration with CI/CD tools like Spinnaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, sidecars will integrate with a service mesh control plane like Istio for E-W traffic. Additionally, repetitive functions like retries and encryption can be offloaded to the sidecars. The distributed nature of the sidecar means that the solution is scalable for such features as observability and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of Service Mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback of a service mesh architecture is the complexity of implementation (managing hundreds or thousands of sidecars is not trivial). The learning curve can be steep for the platform team because there are so many moving parts. A sidecar for every pod adds to CPU and memory needs. Similarly, sidecars add latency. Latency, which may affect application performance, varies with proxy implementation and can be easily measured by the open source tool, Meshery. Citrix CPX as a sidecar offers latency as low as 1ms, whereas other solutions can add much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, a service mesh architecture provides excellent security, observability, and fine-grained traffic management for all traffic flows. The major downside is that it is complex to implement and manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Lite&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-service-mesh-lite-50ff6a2997a34a7d742ad9f5dd996e67.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; alt=&quot;Service Mesh Lite&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you want service mesh-like benefits with much less complexity?  The answer is service mesh lite, which is a variant of service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a service mesh lite architecture, the ADC shown in green in Figure 5 is responsible for Layer 4-7 load balancing for N-S traffic to handle inbound requests and load balance to the right Kubernetes cluster. The green ADC may carry out SSL termination, web application firewalling, authentication, or other network services. It is managed by the networking team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on isolation and scale requirements, service mesh lite proxy architecture uses a single or several ADCs (shown in yellow in Figure 5) that proxy communications among microservices pods to manage inter-pod (E-W) traffic rather than using individual sidecars attached to each pod. Proxies can be deployed per node or per namespace and are managed by platform teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of Service Mesh Lite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh lite provides many of the same benefits as service mesh but reduces the overall complexity by only having a small set of proxy instances per cluster to manage the inter-pod traffic. Passing all E-W traffic through a small set of proxies provides the same advanced policy control, security, and fine-grained traffic management of a service mesh proxy architecture without all the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of service mesh lite is reduced latency as compared to service mesh because end user request goes through fewer  proxies. The main advantage is reduced complexity and the lower skill set required to implement compared to service mesh. Similar to two-tier ingress, the networking team can manage the green ADC, and the platform team can manage the yellow ADC. With service mesh lite, both teams can work in familiar environments and develop at their own speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of Service Mesh Lite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh lite removes the implementation and management associated with service mesh, but the absence of a proxy per pod means that you sacrifice some functionality offload. For example, encryption for E-W must be implemented in each microservice, itself, if required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, service mesh lite provides most of the service mesh features but with reduced complexity and a lower IT skill set requirement. Many organizations who started with the two-tier ingress architecture find it an easy transition to service mesh lite for the added benefits it brings to their E-W traffic including better observability, enhanced security, better integration with open source tools, and support for continuous deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after reviewing the four architecture choices, you’re probably wondering: What ‘s the right architecture choice for my organization? There are no right or wrong answers. Like other architectural choices, proxy deployment models should be selected based on, in part, your application needs and your team structure and your team’s skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your model of proxy deployment is an important consideration, but just one of many when planning for your application delivery infrastructure. Ensuring that the application delivery components in your deployment are well-integrated into the cloud native ecosystem is your next consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Openly Integrating with the Cloud Native Ecosystem &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s imperative that your various application delivery tools and processes, including your proxy, be well-integrated into commonplace cloud native infrastructure. It’s no secret that much of today’s innovation happens in open source software. And clouds, both public and private, are built upon open source software. So in most cases, your infrastructure will be comprised of popular open source infrastructure and tools that you have picked up on your journey to cloud native. To the extent this is the case, you’ll find common integrations by categories in Figure below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-oss-integration-categories-a43533cd84808f3554b20eb4c7b6f1b7.svg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure - Key categories of consideration for proxy integration with Kubernetes platforms and open source tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud native environments make liberal use of open source software projects. Irrespective of which projects you use, suffice it to say that cloud native application delivery can’t be done with just containers. The combination of containers, container orchestration, and a service mesh will get you very far. And alongside a CI/CD system, these components are the most significant and ubiquitously used components of cloud native infrastructure. Integration with each of these categories of cloud native infrastructure is critical so that developers and operators can design and run systems that communicate and inter-operate as a whole. The fact that these bedrocks of cloud native infrastructure are open source unlocks their ability to be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the cloud native ecosystem is the extensible and scalable orchestration infrastructure that is Kubernetes. The cloud native ecosystem (both open source and closed source) extends Kubernetes by writing custom resource definitions (CRDs) and associated controllers. The controllers and CRDs give operators a Kubernetes-native way to manage all parts of their platforms — both open source and closed source. This integration affords tool unification and powerful composable intent-based primitives that truly enable a software-defined platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical to the speed of delivery is an early investment in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD). It’s likely you have already wrangled continuous integration. Continuous deployment pipelines are your next step in seeing that changes to your source code automatically result in a new container being built and a new version of your microservice being tested and deployed to staging and eventually to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, the notion that CI/CD is an area of early investment is counterintuitive, and they find it hard to swallow the upfront engineering effort required to get a solid pipeline in place. The sooner CI/CD basics are implemented, however, the sooner the dividends start paying out. We will cover advanced continuous delivery considerations later in this white paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cloud native infrastructure’s being inherently dynamic (in contrast to infrastructure not driven by APIs,) the ability to observe cloud native infrastructure and its workloads is also necessary. Software is written with functionality and debugging in mind. Most often, developers use logging as the primary method for debugging their applications. Integration with Elasticsearch and Kibana is key here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance counters are another way to track application behavior and performance. Akin to SNMP for physical and virtual network monitoring, the equivalent cloud native “standard” is the use of Prometheus and Grafana, so it’s important that your application delivery solution integrate with these tools. Currently there is no recognized standard for cloud native application performance monitoring metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;OpenMetrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloud native ecosystem needs a common format for the exchange of metrics. Observability pains grow with the release of each newly instrumented service that presents its own metric format. OpenMetrics is an effort to create an open standard for transmitting metrics at scale, with support for both text representation and protocolbBuffers. OpenMetrics builds on Prometheus’s exposition format, popular telemetry formats, and protocols used in infrastructure and application monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the metrics format, there are a few metrics that have been identified as key indicators of the health of a cloud native application (that is, the health of a service): latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Your application delivery solution should assist in producing these signals as well as provide support for the tracing of your distributed, cloud native workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned integrations with open source tools enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Citrix ADC also embodies these characteristics. All of the infrastructure integrations detailed here depend upon APIs for interchange and interoperability. Cloud native applications, too, are centered around declarative APIs to interface with the infrastructure and serve user-facing workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endpoints that your APIs expose are now being managed by open source service meshes. Service meshes deliver the next generation of networking designed for cloud native applications. At the core of a service mesh is its data plane (its collection of proxies). Proxy selection criteria and deployment model tradeoffs are our next area of consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Check out the topic &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/service-mesh/choosing-the-perfect-proxy&quot;&gt;Choosing the Perfect Proxy&lt;/a&gt; to learn more! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Service Proxy]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

The service proxy allows applications to send and receive messages as method calls via a channel. Service proxy connections can be created as needed or persist open connections to facilitate pooling. Applications are oblivious to the data plane&amp;#x27;s existence. As applications conduct service-to-service calls, service proxies are transparently inserted. Inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) cluster network traffic are handled by data planes. Whether traffic is entering the mesh (ingressing) or leaving the mesh (egressing), application service traffic is directed first to the service proxy for handling. In Istio, traffic is transparently intercepted using iptables rules and redirected to the service proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that Pilot configures traffic policy and service proxies implement it. The data plane is a collection of service proxies. Service proxies are responsible for health checks, routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, and the production of observable signals by intercepting every packet in the request. As the service may change from location to location, proxies provide indirection so that clients may point to the same location (e.g., proxy.example.com), representing a permanent reference. They add resilience to distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Envoy Proxy Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The versatile and performant Envoy has evolved as an open source, application-level service proxy, living up to its tagline as the universal data plane API. Lyft developed Envoy in order to solve major distributed systems problems. Envoy has had broad reuse and has been integrated into the cloud native ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why Envoy?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy was originally intended to be used as an edge proxy rather than a sidecar. Envoy transitioned to the sidecar pattern over time. The concept of hot reloads vs. hot restarts was at the center of the decision for the Istio project to leverage Envoy. Envoy&amp;#x27;s runtime configuration has always been API-driven, allowing it to drain and hot reload its own process with an old configuration with a new process and new configuration (displacing itself). Envoy achieves hot reloading of its processes by shared memory and communication through a Unix Domain Socket (UDS), in a manner that resembles GitHub&amp;#x27;s tool for zero-downtime HAProxy reloads. Additionally, and uniquely, Envoy offers an Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS) for delivering the data for each xDS API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;HTTP/2 and gRPC&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy stood apart from other proxies at the time because of its early support for HTTP/2 and gRPC. HTTP/2 significantly improves on HTTP/1.1 in that HTTP/2 enables request multiplexing over a single TCP connection. Proxies that support HTTP/2 benefit from the reduced overhead of combining several connections into a single one. HTTP/2 allows clients to send numerous parallel requests and load resources preemptively using server-push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy is HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compatible, including proxying compatibility for both downstream and upstream protocols. This means Envoy can accept incoming HTTP/2 connections and proxy them to upstream HTTP/2 clusters, but it can also take HTTP/1.1 connections and proxy them to HTTP/2 clusters (and vice-versa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;gRPC is an RPC protocol that uses protocol buffers on top of HTTP/2. Envoy supports gRPC natively (over HTTP/2) and can also bridge an HTTP/1.1 client to gRPC. Envoy has the ability to operate as a gRPC-JSON transcoder. The gRPC-JSON transcoder functionality allows a client to send HTTP/1.1 requests with a JSON payload to Envoy, which translates the request into the corresponding gRPC call and subsequently translates the response message back into JSON. These are powerful capabilities (and challenging to execute correctly), which set Envoy apart from other service proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Envoy in Istio&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an out of process proxy, Envoy transparently forms the base unit of the mesh. Akin to proxies in other service meshes, it is the workhorse of Istio. Istio deploys Envoy sidecarred to application services. Identified as &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; in deployment files, Envoy does not require root privileges to run, but runs as user 1337 (non root).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sidecar Injection (or Sidecarring)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two steps to adding a service proxy: sidecar injection and network capture. Sidecar injection is the method of adding a proxy to a given application. Network capture is the method of directing inbound traffic to the proxy (instead of the application) and outbound traffic to the proxy (instead of directly back to the client or directly to subsequent upstream application services).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Manual Sidecar Injection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Istioctl&lt;/code&gt; can be used to manually inject the Envoy sidecar definition into Kubernetes manifests manually. Use &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code&gt;kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; capability to manually inject the sidecar into deployment manifests by manipulating yaml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml | kubectl apply -f -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can update Kubernetes specifications on-the-fly at the time of applying them to Kubernetes for scheduling.

We&amp;#x27;ll start with exploring BookInfo&amp;#x27;s pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get pods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;details-v1-69658dcf78-nghss       1/1     Running   0          43m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;productpage-v1-6b6798cb84-nzfhd   1/1     Running   0          43m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;ratings-v1-6f97d68b6-v6wj6        1/1     Running   0          43m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v1-7c98dcd6dc-b974c       1/1     Running   0          43m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v2-6677766d47-2qz2g       1/1     Running   0          43m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v3-79f9bcc54c-sjndp       1/1     Running   0          43m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The atomic unit of deployment in Kubernetes is a Pod.  Since a Pod is a collection of containers, it can be one or more containers deployed atomically together. In our example, we can see that each of BookInfo&amp;#x27;s pods is only executing one container. When &lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; is run against  on BookInfo&amp;#x27;s manifests, it adds another container to the Pod specification but does not deploy anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; supports modification of Pod-based Kubernetes objects (Job, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Pod and Deployment) that may be embedded into long yaml files containing other Kubernetes objects. &lt;code&gt;Istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; will parse the other Kubernetes objects without modification. Unsupported resources are left unmodified so it is safe to run kube-inject over a single file that contains multiple Service, ConfigMap, Deployment, etc. definitions for a complex application. It is best to do this when the resource is initially created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to onboard this existing application, we can execute &lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; against each Deployment and have a rolling update of that Deployment initiated by Kubernetes as shown below. Let’s start with the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get deployment productpage-v1 -o yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -f -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;deployment.extensions/productpage-v1 configured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now notice that the productpage pod has grown to two containers when we look at the BookInfo pods again. Istio’s sidecar has been successfully injected. The rest of BookInfo’s application services need to be onboarded in order for BookInfo as an application to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get pods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;details-v1-69658dcf78-nghss       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;productpage-v1-64647d4c5f-z95dl   2/2     Running   0          64s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;ratings-v1-6f97d68b6-v6wj6        1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v1-7c98dcd6dc-b974c       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v2-6677766d47-2qz2g       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v3-79f9bcc54c-sjndp       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may choose to do this manual injection operation once and persist the new manifest file with istio-proxy (Envoy) inserted instead of ad-hoc onboarding of a running application. You can create a persistent version of the sidecar injected deployment outputting the results of &lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; to a file. As Istio evolves the default sidecar configuration is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl kube-inject -f deployment.yaml -o deployment-injected.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl kube-inject -f deployment.yaml &amp;gt; deployment-injected.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ad-hoc Sidecarring&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidecar injection is responsible for configuring network capture. Injection and network capture can be selectively applied to enable incremental adoption of Istio. Using the BookInfo sample application as an example, let’s take the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; service as the external-facing service and selectively remove this service (and just this service out of the set of four) from the service mesh. Let&amp;#x27;s start by checking for the presence of its sidecarred service proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get pods productpage-8459b4f9cf-tfblj -o jsonpath=&amp;quot;{.spec.containers[*].image}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;layer5/istio-bookinfo-productpage:v1 docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, productpage container is our application container, while the istio/proxy is the service proxy (Envoy) that Istio injected into the pod. To manually onboard and offboard a deployment onto and off of the service mesh, you can manipulate annotation within its Kubernetes Deployment specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl patch deployment nginx --type=json --patch=&amp;#x27;[{&amp;quot;op&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;add&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;path&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/spec/template/metadata/annotations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;sidecar.istio.io/inject&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;}}]&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;deployment.extensions/productpage-v1 patched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;On opening your browser to the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; application, and you’ll find that it is still being served through Istio’s Ingress Gateway, but that its pods no longer have sidecars. Hence, the productpage app has been removed from the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;UNAVAILABLE:upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automatic Sidecar Injection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;No code change to receive much more visibility into how your services are behaving and how they are being interacted gives Istio a magical feeling once your services are on the mesh. Automatic sidecar injection is the magical feeling you get as you go to onramp your services.Not only does automatic sidecar injection eliminate the need to alter your code, but it also eliminates the need to change your Kubernetes manifests. Automatic sidecar injection in Kubernetes relies on mutating admission webhooks. The &lt;code&gt;istio-sidecar-injector&lt;/code&gt; is added as a mutating webhook configuration resource when Istio is installed on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME                                    CREATED AT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;istio-sidecar-injector                  2019-04-18T16:35:03Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;linkerd-proxy-injector-webhook-config   2019-04-18T16:48:49Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations istio-sidecar-injector -o yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

The injector service will then modify the PodSpec to include two more containers, one for the init-container to configure traffic rules and the other for istio-proxy (Envoy) to perform proxying.  The sidecar injector service uses a template to add these two additional containers; the template may be found in the &lt;code&gt;istio-sidecar-injector configmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes lifecycle allows customization of resources before they are committed to the etcd store, the ‘source of truth’ for Kubernetes configuration. When an individual Pod is created (either via kubectl or a Deployment resource), it goes through this same lifecycle, hitting mutating admission webhooks which modify the pod before it actually gets applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kubernetes Labels&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatic sidecar injection relies on labels to identify which pods to inject Istio’s service proxy and initialize as pod on the data plane. Kubernetes objects, like pods and namespaces, can have user-defined labels attached to them. Labels are essentially &lt;code&gt;key:value&lt;/code&gt; pairs like you finding in other systems that support the concept of tags. Webhook Admission controller relies on labels to select the namespaces they apply to. Istio-injection is the specific label that Istio uses. Familiarize by labeling the default namespace with &lt;code&gt;istio-injection=enabled&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirm which namespaces have the istio-injection label associated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME           STATUS    AGE       ISTIO-INJECTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;default        Active    1h        enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Docker         Active    1h        enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;istio-system   Active    1h        disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-public    Active    1h        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-system    Active    1h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that only the &lt;code&gt;istio-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace has the &lt;code&gt;istio-injection&lt;/code&gt; label assigned. By virtue of having the &lt;code&gt;istio-injection&lt;/code&gt; label and its value set to disabled, the &lt;code&gt;istio-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace will not have service proxies automatically injected into their pods upon deployment. This does not mean that pods in this namespace cannot have service proxies. It just means that service proxies won’t be automatically injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caveat to watch out for, when using the &lt;code&gt;namespaceSelector&lt;/code&gt;, make sure that the namespace(s) you are selecting really has the label you are using. Keep in mind that the built-in namespaces like default and &lt;code&gt;kube-system&lt;/code&gt; don’t have labels out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the namespace in the metadata section is the actual name of the namespace, not a label:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kind: NetworkPolicy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;metadata:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  name: test-network-policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  namespace: default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;spec:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kubernetes Init Containers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very similar to cloud-init for those familiar with VM provisioning, init containers in Kubernetes allows you to run temporary containers to perform a task before engaging your primary container(s).

Init containers are frequently used for provisioning operations such as asset bundling, database migration, and cloning a git repository onto a volume.
