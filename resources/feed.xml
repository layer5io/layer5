Managing the myriad configurations of cloud native infrastructure is greatly facilitated by a service mesh, but succinctly summarizing and characterizing the performance of your service mesh in context of your unique workloads and your infrastructure of choice is a challenge unto its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explore how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before you deploy to production. Readers will understand how distributed performance analysis offers unique insights on the behavior of microservices and their efficiency of operation, see examples of how common types of workloads perform under specific service mesh functions, and be empowered with analytical tooling that can be used to make optimized configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide core, memory and I/O combinations based on workload needs with insights into workload analysis which can influence the efficiency of the service mesh and overall performance of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Characterizing the Complexity of Combinatorial Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider that the more value you try to derive from your service mesh, the more work that you will ask it to do. Said another way, that as someone reflects more deeply on the architecture of a service mesh - with its distributed proxies - and the functionality it offers, they will eventually wonder, &amp;quot;What overhead is running my service mesh incurring?&amp;quot;. This is one of the most common questions engineers have as they initially learn of a service mesh and the value a deployment of one offers. This is not an easy question to answer as the permutations of configuration between your infrastructure, service mesh, and applications are innumerable and any change to one of them affects their collective performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you describe the performance of your service mesh and that of your clusters and their workloads? Are you imagining a wall of line charts with metrics capturing golden signals? The act of articulating the performance of your service mesh can take anywhere from a minute to even a few hours to characterize the state of your systems and the overhead incurred by your infrastructure and what this means to your users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, anytime performance is characterized, analysis is subjective to the specific workload, infrastructure, and instruments used for measurement. Given the variety of this measurement challenge, most service meshes and their data plane proxies (if a third-party component), do not have the tooling necessary or refuse to publish performance data because such tests can be:&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;arduous to create and sustain a capable harness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a point-in-time consideration (none of the elements under measurement are static&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;misinterpreted&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on as we identify how to surmount each of these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Service Mesh Performance Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the software defined networking layer of microservices, service mesh encompasses multiple aspects of critical functions of the applications, such as circuit breaking, health checks, and packet operations. Analyzing the permutations of these configurations is an impossible task without a suitable test harness. A service mesh management plane can be such a tool. As the multi-mesh manager, &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io&quot;&gt;Meshery &lt;/a&gt;is capable of provisioning 10 different service meshes, workloads atop the meshes, generating load using &lt;a href=&quot;https://getnighthawk.dev&quot;&gt;Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt;, and analyzing that load. No other tool capable of performing these tasks end-to-end exists. Meshery is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project originally created by Layer5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How are you measuring?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider the simple set of steps to execute performance tests in a simple Kubernetes-based cluster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setup your cluster, service mesh, and application under test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a benchmarking tool that can measure Layer 4 or Layer 7 performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configure your test setup for performance, doing so in context of other constraints that you might need to uphold (e.g. resiliency characteristics of your service deployment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose the protocol of interest: HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP1/2, gRPC, NATS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify KPIs of interest - Transactions per second (TPS) or percentile latencies, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Decide on the test duration: 60s or 5 minutes or 1 hour...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose the number of requests per second (RPS).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Execute the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mark down requests per second, latencies, throughput, and any other output provided by benchmarking tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are you measuring?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance of a service mesh can be described across multiple dimensions covering some or all of these core functionalities of a service mesh. So, which dimensions are the linchpins of performance? Which metrics are key indicators of performance? Outside of the different types of performance tests, performance management concerns include the need for performance and overhead data under a permutation of different workloads (applications) and different types and sizes of infrastructure resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/figure-1-2e917eeefb309ad5b67cdb79d82d5faf.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure-1-2e917eeefb309ad5b67cdb79d82d5faf.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;EWtraffic&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, it is crucial to understand what is being measured in a service mesh based deployment. Certain critical considerations are missing from the simple methodology previously described. For example, as indicated in Figure 1, but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traffic considerations&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;East-West traffic&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;between two pods within the same or two different Virtual Machines (VM).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;between two pods within the same or two different bare metal nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;combination of above with choice of user-space or kernel-space networking stack on the host node.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;North-South traffic&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Throughput and latency of traffic flowing in and out of a single VM or across a single bare metal node.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deployment considerations&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Number of hops between traffic source and traffic destination with load balancers, API gateways, ingress controllers, security components such as firewall, deep packet inspectors, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Operating system settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hardware settings such as BIOS options, power management features, NUMA awareness, platform resource management, hardware accelerators, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load generators types&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;hardware or software based, L2-3,  L4-7, open or closed loop&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Service mesh types - the service mesh landscape has over 20 meshes listed.

Individual service mesh projects shy from publishing test results of other, competing service mesh projects. The need for an independent, unbiased, credible, standard measurement is one of the catalysts for the creation of Service Mesh Performance (SMP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst performance concerns and the need to measure and manage performance arose the Service Mesh Performance (SMP) standard. Service Mesh Performance as a specification and disseminating insights and research results. Your authors are working toward the definition of MeshMark, a universal performance index to gauge your mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many performance benchmarks are limited to single instance load generation (single pod load generator). This limits the amount of traffic that can be generated to the output of the single machine that the benchmark tool runs on in or out of a cluster. Overcoming this limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing. Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles.

Given the complexity of deploying, testing and measuring performance aspects across multiple dimensions, the specification aims to provide a simple starting point for anyone looking to understand and derive service mesh performance. The service mesh performance standard aims to articulate these complexities in a methodical and automated manner in order for anyone to plan the performance scenarios of their deployment and execute relevant tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code snippet provides insight on the fact that the specification defines a common collection of statistical analysis to be calculated for every performance test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-yaml&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;message PerformanceTestResult &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  message Latency &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    double min = 1;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    double average = 2;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    double p50 = 3;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    double p90 = 4;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    double p99 = 5;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    double max = 6;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Snippet of the Service Mesh Performance specification describing how to capture statistical analysis of test results.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defining Deployments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtualized deployments involve deploying microservice orchestration and service mesh stack in virtual machines (VMs). Although bare metal usage has performance benefits, customers often use VMs to provide hardware-level isolation between various applications. This deployment involves two VMs across two nodes, with one acting as a Kubernetes master with the other a worker node. Customers deploy VMs on a single NUMA node to avoid cross UPI traffic. Results in virtualized testing have shown that depending on pinning of QEMU threads to a set of isolated cores - either sequentially or clustering the threads together to all the cores - tail latencies are heavily impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microservice deployments could use a wide variety of deployment scenarios. The following list provides a sample set of how a service mesh performance could be analyzed either on a same node or in a multi-node cluster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pod to pod communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pod to service communication.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ingress controller to pod and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load balancer to pod and vice-versa.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pod to Egress Gateway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mutual TLS termination across any of the above endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Different security rules and policies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Communication protocol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These considerations are illustrated in a typical workload deployment as shown in &lt;i&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/figure-2-56880ed83f94d4c64e6163163859a6ea.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure-2-56880ed83f94d4c64e6163163859a6ea.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Workload&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of deployment with Kubernetes as the orchestrator using Calico CNI and deployed in VMs, while the host infrastructure has OVS-DPDK for switching, which can be extended for VMs to leverage SR-IOV. To understand impact of infrastructure elements and networking elements of microservice software stack, performance impact of a service mesh and its set of data plane proxies with fortio as load generator could be understood by running the Meshery in two different environments outside the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;First one with load generator running as a process outside of Kubernetes cluster in master-vm&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second one with load generator running as a bare metal process on master-host&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Automating Performance Measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery is ideal tooling in that it provides lifecycle management of a large number of service meshes and sample applications which need to be provisioned, configured, and deprovisioned in the process of analyzing service mesh performance. Meshery is capable of generating load, baselining, and comparing performance results. The canonical implementation of this specification is implemented in Meshery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/Meshery Architecture - Clients-1bb8a8dd590218403e5f9c4ef02e80a3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Meshery Architecture - Clients-1bb8a8dd590218403e5f9c4ef02e80a3.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Archictures-client&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 4 - Meshery’s load generators can be deployed in the same cluster under test or outside of the cluster under test.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Pipelining performance characterization&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging the living nature of user deployments, integration of automated performance testing into continuous integration systems helps users deploy new versions of their applications or new configurations of their infrastructure (including service mesh configuration) with the assurity  afforded through the act of dry-running the service mesh and application configuration before production deployment. The Meshery and Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action offers the ability to adaptively analyze application performance as a gate in your continuous delivery pipeline. In this way, the Service Mesh Performance specification facilitates a measurement index that can be referenced when rolling out new versions of a service with this advanced canary technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Meshery, techniques to mirror non-idempotent requests without fear of impacting the current version of your application allowing replay of user requests. And use of intelligent network functions, embedded in WebAssembly (WASM) programs, to facilitate real user request reenactments to help you extract the most value out of your pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Repeatability of test scenarios using performance profiles and cloud native orchestration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baselining and comparing results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Analyzing Performance Measurements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have often seen inefficiencies in the ratio of resource usage vs resources applied. Since the mesh elements i.e. the ingress and sidecars share resources with one or more of the application containers, there may be more resources left to be utilized. Tail latencies decrease with the increase in number of cores for all 1, 10 and 100 clones but increase with the increase in the number of connections. Data for various connection counts, as shown, indicates that performance degradation with Istio shows up with input RPS more than 1000. In a top down microarchitectural analysis (TMA), when the front proxy is pinned to a single core and the sidecar + flask app is pinned to another core and the number of microservices are scaled up. It is observed that (Figure 2):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frontend Bound% decreases with increase in number of microservices​ and Core Bound % increases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Memory Bound % increases with increase in the number of microservices​.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;L1 and L3 Bound% decreases for both the service cores on which the front –proxy is running as well as the core where the sidecar+flask app is running with number of microservices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In customer environments, the size of the cluster as well as the amount of incoming traffic will have an impact on the number of workloads and Envoy microservices. The underlying hardware and L4 networking on each node in the cluster will also impact the performance observed. A call stack and cycles spent analysis of a deployment with 1-20 sidecars on a specific 40 core system with a 10G NIC shows bottlenecks spread between:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Envoy:TheadLocalStorage-Hashset-Match&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linux kernel bottleneck spread between&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Libpthreadscheduling&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Libevent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Envoy buffer slice management and TCP filter, if message sizes or file transfer sizes increase to 1M&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Crypto operations when TLS is enabled.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our initial studies show that the optimal service mesh setup for the tolerable latencies and the best RPS may include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exclusive  threads allocated to Envoy processing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduced memory contention by allocating more memory bandwidth which can be controlled dynamically&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Load balancing of worker threads among the among cores which may require&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Less IO switching&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Optimized memory copies with signals incorporated in addition to events (libevent)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Accelerations and Offloads&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of accelerations and offloads to SMART NIC or other processing elements like IPUs and DPUs are becoming available. How does the service mesh efficiency and performance benefitted from these deployment options needs to be defined and measured. Cycles and cores saved in the host cores vs offload cores which may be of different architectures and/or performance range needs to be quantified and benchmarks and indices created to measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Being Precise in Performance Studies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When measuring sub-millisecond response times, the noise floor of the environment as well as the sensitivity of the tooling may become dominant factors in measurements. Noisy neighbours, scheduler fairness, garbage collection, and even specifics in the timing of requests being sent as well as connection-reuse patterns may change noise floors such that similar measurements performed using different systems and tools may diverge an order of magnitude in absolute terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a quick survey of load generators by way of those included in Meshery, we find upon close inspection their differences are noteworthy and justify their use under different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in C, wrk2 supports ignoring coordinated omission. wrk2 lets you test a little more complex scenarios. Users express load generation profiles in terms of RPS. wrk2 shows you what you normally may not see in benchmark results, but what every 1,000th user might see. To see these outliers, you need to run the longer (time) performance tests.  Wrk2 tests the scenario where there&amp;#x27;s a string of services comprising microservices. wrk2 requires you to specify the desired RPS, while wrk does not. Wrk2 is focused on driving the maximum RPS. Meshery’s fork of wrk2 enables testing of multiple endpoints and enables the variable rate of load generation. In the future, Meshery will offer the ability to assign a weight to each endpoint for the load to be generated by wrk2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in Golang, fortio is extremely fast and usable for testing basic response times on a per request level. Fortio produces results in JSON on a per request basis and easy to integrate into other Golang-based tooling like Meshery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in C++, Nighthawk supports both open- and closed- loop testing, and was designed to offer the right sensitivity for benchmarking microservice proxies (sub millisecond latencies). Using an open loop test methodology avoids coordinated omission, and in conjunction with its adaptive load controller one can seek answers to questions like “what RPS can my mesh reliably sustain under set latency?”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Comparing Types of Data Plane Filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important to note is the power of the service mesh data plane and cost of that power. Envoy is a popular proxy of choice for service mesh data planes. Among other features, Envoy provides the ability to integrate custom traffic filters via one of two methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Natively by incorporating your custom traffic filter into Envoy’s C++ source code and compiling a new Envoy version. The drawback being that you need to maintain your own version of Envoy, while the benefit being that of your custom filter running at native speed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Via WASM by incorporating your custom filter as a WebAssembly binary writing in C++, Rust, AssemblyScript or Go. The drawback being that WASM-based filters incur some overhead, while the benefit being that you can dynamically load and reload WASM-based filters in Envoy at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether to  integrate your traffic filters natively or as an extension, a tradeoff between the two deployment exists primarily in exchanging between service mesh speed and service mesh flexibility as shown in &lt;i&gt;Figure 4.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/Comparison of different modes of delivery of service mesh network functions-35336a794ba87248f68ea66ffd850253.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Comparison of different modes of delivery of service mesh network functions-35336a794ba87248f68ea66ffd850253.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;comparison of Network functions&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 5 - A comparison of different modes of delivery of service mesh network functions.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an assessment of this tradeoff, an analysis of a series of three tests run across the same rate limit network function implemented as 1) a Golang-based client library, or 2) a Rust-based Envoy filter running in a WebAssembly virtual machine  (or 3) a native Envoy filter) provides some insight as to the comparative overhead involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rate limiting with Go client library&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 100 RPS the p50 is 3.19ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 500 RPS the p50 is 2.44ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With unlimited RPS (4,417) the p50 is 0.066ms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rate limiting with WASM module (Rust filter)&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 100 RPS the p50 is 2.1ms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At 500 RPS the p50 is 2.22ms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With unlimited RPS (5,781) the p50 is 0.62ms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users not only need to account for the (relatively) easy to quantify system overhead and the operational overhead involved in expanding development resources to implement bespoke tooling versus managing off-the-shelf filters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deploy a service mesh effectively, we need to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;quantify application workload characteristics and how it utilizes a particular microarchitecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;assess how Container Network Interface (CNI) drivers, Open Virtual Switch (OVS), rules processing, match and lookup requirements between Network Address Translated (NAT) and routed networks are required&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; different layers of service mesh to be deployed including layer 4 load balancers, ingress and reverse proxy, number of sidecars and number of microservices to be supported&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and what hardware baseline performance does the setup have and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; a quantifiable measure of service mesh deployed with performance measures mapped to KPIs like throughput (RPS) and latency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[API Gateways interplay with service meshes]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

Examples of this include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;APIUmbrella&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kong&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;OpenResty&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Envoy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Envoy project also has been used as the foundation for API gateways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ambassador: Based on Envoy, Ambassador is an API gateway for microservices functioning stand-alone or as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contour: Based on Envoy and deployed as a Kubernetes Ingress Controller. Hosted in the CNCF.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enroute: Envoy Route Controller. API Gateway created for Kubernetes ingress controller, and standalone deployments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other differences between traditional API gateways and microservices API gateways revolve around which team uses the gateway: operators or developers. Operators tend to measure API calls per consumer to meter and disallow API calls when a consumer exceeds its quota. Developers, on the other hand, tend to track L7 latency, throughput, and resilience, limiting API calls when the service is not responding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important distinctions to make when it comes to service meshes is that API gateways are designed to accept traffic from outside your organization/network and distribute it internally. API gateways expose your services as managed APIs, focused on transiting north/south traffic. They aren’t as well suited for traffic management within the service mesh necessarily, because they require traffic to travel through a central proxy and add a network hop. Service meshes are primarily designed to handle east/west traffic internal to the service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact-left&quot;&gt;Traffic Directions&lt;p&gt;North-south (N-S) traffic refers to traffic between clients outside the Kubernetes cluster and services inside the cluster, while east-west (E-W) traffic refers to traffic between services inside the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;API gateways and service meshes are frequently deployed in combination due to  their complementing nature. Service meshes are on their way to providing much, if not all, of the functionality that API gateways do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;API Management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;API gateways work with other API management ecosystem components like API marketplaces and API publishing portals, both of which are surfacing in service mesh offerings. Analytics, business data, adjunct provider services like single sign-on, and API versioning control are all provided by API management solutions.  Many API management vendors have migrated their API management systems to a single point of architecture, with API gateways designed to be implemented at the edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An API gateway can call downstream services via service mesh by offloading application network functions to the service mesh. Some API management capabilities that are oriented toward developer engagement can overlap with service mesh management planes in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developers use a portal to discover APIs available for API documentation and discovery,  API testing, and exercising their code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;API analytics for tracking KPIs, generating reports on usage and adoption trending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;API lifecycle management to secure APIs (allocate keys) and promote or demote APIs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monetization to tracking payment plans and enforcing quotas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Choosing the Perfect Proxy]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

An alternate method, also supported by Citrix, is to use ingress annotations that expose TCP/UDP ports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three methods make it much easier for TCP/UDP applications to be used as microservices without extensive code rewrites or protocol changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Securing Your Applications and APIs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-api-security-considerations-by-traffic-direction-fd6855ee14436ab0085a6960ffce8734.svg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;API security considerations by traffic direction.&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;API security considerations by traffic direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traffic direction will dictate your security needs, the reality is that several concerns are shared considerations for both north-south and east-west traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through the API security requirements one by one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ingress Security (North-South) &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As services are exposed outside the cluster, the security considerations remain similar to those of monolithic deployments. In addition to ensuring protections like IP blacklist/whitelist and a robust encryption profile (SSL/TLS), it is imperative that the services are protected against both layer 3-4 and layer 7 DDoS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authentication/authorization are equally critical to ensure that the right access controls are established and maintained on data, APIs, and services. At the same time, as attacks are moving to the application layer, web application firewall (WAF) protections like SQL injection (SQLi), buffer overflow, and signature protections are table stakes. As the types of attacks are continuously evolving and because applications and APIs are changing many times a month, it is also critical that the protection mechanisms include behavior-based methods to automate the protection policies and detect potential zero-day attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;API Gateway and Security (North-South)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs are becoming the currency for digital transformation and for microservices that provide services via API, and therefore routing, security, control, and visibility for APIs is critical. API gateways are a perfect function to achieve these capabilities and typically are combined with the ingress solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;API gateway solutions offer key functions like authentication, authorization, rate limiting, policy-based routing of APIs, and API versioning. In addition, the traditional controls applicable to a N-S web service are equally applicable and even more important to apply to APIs. API security is not just about authentication but also about ensuring that the content coming in from authenticated sources is not malicious. API gateway functions typically get configured in ingress through configmaps or CRDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Intra-Cluster Security for Service Mesh or Service Mesh-Lite (East-West)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure application deployment and secure infrastructure best practices dictate security controls in terms of both N-S and E-W service traffic (the former is generally more intuitively understood) because one layer of security isn’t enough, and in-depth defense is needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the number and variety of your microservices expand, the pattern we’ve seen is that services might start as internal use only, but over time end up being exposed externally to customers and partners. The gooey center of your cluster, where you initially intend to have most of your service-to-service interactions, needs to be as secure because service-to-service interactions expand to those outside the cluster. Service meshes are a natural solution here. To obtain this added layer of security (and many other benefits), the adoption of service meshes is on the rise, dramatically. When your application delivery controller integrates with a service mesh, API security is broadly upleveled and guaranteed up to a certain point irrespective of developers&amp;#x27; rigor in incorporating secure coding practices. That’s because a service mesh runs as a layer of your infrastructure, relieving developers of a number of (but not all) identity, authentication, and authorization concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, inter-services communication should be mutually authenticated via transport layer security (TLS) so that only permitted API connections are allowed. Previously, this may have been implemented with each individual service, but the service mesh enables this functionality to be offloaded to a sidecar ADC, like Citrix CPX, and managed by the service mesh control plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it should be possible to ensure a faster and more consistent approach to SSL policy in microservices environments through the use of SSL profiles. By defining acceptable SSL settings (for example, ciphers, protocol, and key strength) and binding them to your different entities, developers can quickly deploy consistent encryption policies that meet the appropriate security requirements. After all, isn’t the goal here to facilitate both developer velocity while ensuring that necessary security practices are met?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another rapidly emerging technology to enable developer velocity is serverless computing. While serverless does indeed involve servers, it leverages infrastructure as code to run backend services as needed, which frees the developer from having to worry about scaling, patching, security, and infrastructure reliability. API gateways are key to applications built with serverless because the developer can simply specify policy such as authentication, authorization, and rate limits without worrying about the form factor, performance, and reliability of the proxy that usually provides these features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s explore aspects of another benefit use of a service mesh provides: traffic control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Enabling CI/CD and Canary Deployment with Advanced Traffic Steering&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your application delivery solution should be an enabler of continuous delivery and canary deployments by providing advanced traffic steering. Intelligent proxies are required here. If you’re using a control plane (and not configuring the proxies directly), understand that you will only be able to harness the full power of your proxies to the extent that the control plane exposes their capabilities for configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Canary Deployment  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to facilitate canary deployments, you need a powerful proxy. Kubernetes facilitates rolling updates to a service deployment, focusing on ensuring that traffic shifting from one version of a service to the next happens gradually over time and with zero downtime. However, Kubernetes on its own doesn’t offer the level of granular control over traffic necessary for simply exposing your canary to a subset of users that you identify. Nor is it convenient for error rate and performance monitoring. Although performance monitoring is integral for canary analysis, many times the solutions for automated canary analysis are cobbled together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A canary deployment is manual in that you will need to manually check that the canary behaves as you want before doing a full deployment (caution: the difference between canary and baseline isn&amp;#x27;t always clear). Robust application delivery solutions support &lt;b&gt;automated canary analysis&lt;/b&gt; and progressive rollout. With an automated canary analysis, not only are you able to avoid manual administration of the deployment, but you can also rely on an automated statistical analysis to better detect problems in the set of metrics you’ve identified as indicators of a healthy deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A/B testing&lt;/b&gt; requires full control over traffic distribution with several versions of your service running in parallel as you run various experimental tests. Experimentations often include measuring differences in conversion rates between versions of a service with the aim of improving a given business metric. To facilitate these experiments, you might want to direct requests based on various criteria like a client’s browser type and version or a user segment based on the presence of a specific cookie or the effect of UI changes on user behavior and the impact on overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chaos engineering&lt;/b&gt; is akin to A/B testing in that it is an emergent practice that facilitates experimentation. Experimentation here is for purposes of testing and improving application delivery resiliency. Chaos engineering will evolve and expand in use as the complexity and rate of change of large-scale distributed systems demand new tools and techniques for increasing reliability and resiliency. Service-oriented teams (as opposed to infrastructure-oriented platform teams) will push past chaos engineering tools such as Chaos Monkey for inducing machine failures and skip Chaos Kong for evacuating entire regions. Instead they will move to application delivery solutions to perform precise service-level experiments on their path to improving application resiliency via orchestrated chaos. It&amp;#x27;s through exploration of the impact of increased latency and methodical failure of specific services that service teams will gain confidence in their systems’ capabilities to withstand turbulent conditions in production and begin to sleep more soundly at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savvy cloud native engineers understand the nuances of these delivery methods, and the key role that the proxy plays in enabling these methods. Note, however, that the need for these methods is not restricted to cloud native workloads. These application delivery solution considerations generally apply to microservices and monolithic services in that irrespective of a given service’s architecture, new versions of the service need to be deployed and managed. Because we live in a hybrid world, we encourage you to seek application delivery solutions that do, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Achieving Holistic Observability &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observability is crucial for effective troubleshooting of microservices environments, but the ephemeral nature and complexity of distributed architecture presents serious challenges. It&amp;#x27;s incredibly hard to maintain awareness of what&amp;#x27;s happening in your environment when containers are continuously created and destroyed. Continuous deployment adds to the transient nature of containers because DevOps teams often push many new deployments per day to update their applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the number of things to monitor — services, containers, users — is enormous, and the fact that everything is distributed makes microservices an incredibly complex environment. While it’s easy to determine if a service is down, troubleshooting slow applications is not? How can you isolate problems among all of the vast telemetry data to find the root cause, especially with inter-microservices (E-W) traffic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You cannot monitor what you can&amp;#x27;t see. This is why it is vitally important to have inspection points through which the traffic passes. When they are correctly positioned, proxies/ADCs collect telemetry for an unprecedented view of application traffic — both N-S and E-W traffic across both monolithic and microservices architectures — and they report important data to collection tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome the challenge of gaining observability into microservices, you need to build an observability stack. The stack should consist of four pillars: logging, metrics, tracing, and service graphs. However, these should not be viewed as individual, disjointed components but rather as a holistic observability stack that is integrated and can combine data as required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logs are an immutable record of an individual event at a particular time. They are designed into systems, and there tends to be a log record to accompany almost every action. While logs are highly granular, they are limited in their searchability, and it is not usually feasible to process them manually. ADC feeds log data into tools like Elasticsearch for processing and indexing and Kibana for data visualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metrics are data points that are measured over time that can be used to monitor trends and set alerts. In addition to the system resources of your individual proxies, the unique position of the proxies means that it sees important information about the use of the application - number of requests, HTTP request rate, errors and more. These metrics can be exported by ADCs to tools like Prometheus where they can be processed and tools like Grafana can visualize them, set alarms create heat maps to help you understand the status of your ADCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flow of packets through a microservices-based application can be complex spanning multiple services (sometimes multiple times) so identifying why a service is slow can be difficult. Distributed Tracing is a technique that monitors request flow through microservices to build a map of the latency through each microservice hop. Trace is an end-to-end latency graph of a specific request. It represents the entire journey of a request and helps troubleshoot latency issues. Distributed tracing can also be used to understand the application architecture and services not being used. ADC integrates with open source tools like OpenTracing and Zipkin for distributed tracing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Graphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service graphs are dynamic graphical representations of microservices and their interdependencies. Service graphs, like that of the service graph in the Citrix Application Delivery Manager (ADM) console, provide detail on connectivity among microservices, help you identify issues via simple color coding, and learn composite health scores for each microservice based on throughput, saturation, errors, and latency. More than this, Citrix service graphs also have a built in DVR-like function, which allows you to zero in on the specific time period when an issue occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given their distillment of complex microservices into a graphical form, service graphs need to provide the ability to tag microservices and to use tags to search, sort , and filter. In this way, you can create custom service graph views of microservices running in production only or you can restrict your view to see details just for canary microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a complement to the basic pillars of observability (logs, metrics, and traces), service graphs enhance your observability stack. They provide a holistic view of your microservices-based application environments in a single place for an intuitive and convenient way to gain insight and troubleshoot microservices environments faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Managing Monoliths and Microservices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hybrid cloud now a reality for many organizations, managing multiple environments with divergent capabilities and management systems is also a reality. Operating with confidence requires reconciling these differences into a uniform operational model and, subsequently, into a uniform understanding with consistent (read: quality) control. For operational consistency, you need a single pane of glass to manage your application delivery infrastructure across:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any application: monolithic and microservices-based applications&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any environment: on-premises, public, private, and hybrid &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any ADC form factor: physical, virtual, cloud, containers, sidecars, and more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need holistic control and monitoring for operational consistency across all your workloads (new microservices and existing monoliths). Ideally, you’ll get such consistency from the proxy you’ve put in place. As you select your proxy, exercise caution when piecing together components from disparate vendors/projects into a solution, because this will not only require integration effort, but also separate specialization to understand and operate. The overhead of integration and specialization can be avoided when your proxy portfolio is robust and supports any application, any environment and form factor with operatonal consistancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as the large public cloud providers extend their reach on-premises with offerings like Google Anthos, AWS Outposts, and Azure Stack, and as organizations adopt them as simpler paths to cloud migration, it becomes important to use a proxy that works in multiple environments. A battle-tested solution like Citrix ADC that is validated to work in Google Anthos and AWS Outposts environments both in the cloud and on-premises can be invaluable for maintaining operational consistency across your hybrid multi-cloud environment. Because Citrix ADC comes in a variety of form factors (including hardware, software, bare metal, cloud, containers, sidecars, and more) that are built on a single code base, it works across your hybrid workloads in a uniform fashion and prevents a sprawl of heterogenous load balancers across your environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Client Libraries]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

We will perform a basic installation on your local machine and deploy a few services onto the mesh. Let’s start by understanding its supported platforms and configuring our environment for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Preparing Your Environment for Istio&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Istio, we&amp;#x27;ll be deploying BookInfo, its sample application. Our Istio and BookInfo deployments will lay down several containers. We will use Kubernetes as the platform to manage these containers. Kubernetes is a robust container orchestration system capable of forming clusters (a collection of nodes) and scheduling containers across nodes within the fleet of host machines (nodes) that form the cluster. Nodes are Linux or Windows servers that can run containers with a Kubernetes agent, kubelet, installed. Kubernetes is the first and best supported underlying platform among a variety of to-be-supported underlying systems. As a result, we&amp;#x27;ll be using Kubernetes throughout our examples. To be clear, Istio is not dependent on Kubernetes. Istio is designed to be platform agnostic and supports multiple deployment platforms including those without a container orchestrator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Docker Desktop as the Installation Environment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can deploy Kubernetes in a variety of ways. We&amp;#x27;ll utilize Docker Desktop as a convenient tool for this. Docker Desktop is an easy-to-install application for your Mac or Windows environment that allows you to run Kubernetes and Istio on your local machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install Docker Desktop and verify that you have a functional Docker environment by running &lt;code&gt;`$ docker run hello-world`&lt;/code&gt; on the command line. If you get a &lt;code&gt;“Hello from Docker!”&lt;/code&gt; message, you’ve confirmed that Docker isable to pull images, create new instances, and run as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#x27;ll run Kubernetes on Docker Desktop and leverage Kubernetes as the platform to deploy Istio. The Docker Desktop managed Kubernetes server is a single-node Kubernetes cluster that runs locally within your Docker instance. It is not configurable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Docker Desktop for Mac Kubernetes integration provides the Kubernetes CLI executable at &lt;code&gt;/usr/local/bin/kubectl&lt;/code&gt;. The Docker Desktop for Windows Kubernetes integration provides the Kubernetes CLI executable at &lt;code&gt;C:\&amp;gt;Program Files\Docker\Docker\Resources\bin\kubectl.exe&lt;/code&gt;. This location may not be in your shell’s &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; variable, so you may need to type the full path of the command or add it to the &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt;. For more information about &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, see the official &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Configuring Docker Desktop&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sure your Docker Desktop virtual machine has enough memory to run Kubernetes, Istio, and Istio&amp;#x27;s sample application, BookInfo, you&amp;#x27;ll need to set it up with at least 4GiB of RAM. All Istio and BookInfo services require this amount of memory to operate effectively.  Pilot, in particular, may have problems running as it requests 2048Mi of memory in an Istio deployment with default settings (see &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/service-mesh/istio-v15-at-a-glance&quot;&gt; Istio v1.5 at a Glance&lt;/a&gt; for a quick overview of Pilot&amp;#x27;s purpose). Considering 2048Mi is also the default limit for Docker Desktop, Pilot may refuse to start due to insufficient resources if this limit is not increased in your Docker installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of increasing the amount of memory allocated to your Docker Desktop installation, you may limit the amount of memory that Pilot requests of your Kubernetes cluster.  Depending on whether you&amp;#x27;re utilizing a package manager like Helm or directly using Kubernetes spec files, there are a couple of options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml&lt;/code&gt; as an example manifest, lets highlights which section of the Pilo spec to edit in order to reduce the 2048Mi of memory requested by Pilot to something smaller like 512Mi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kind: Deployment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;metadata:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  name: istio-pilot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  namespace: istio-system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;          resources:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;            requests:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;              cpu: 500m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;              memory: 2048Mi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When deploying Istio with Helm, you can also offer custom settings.

Verify Kubernetes installation and your current context by running &lt;code&gt;`$ kubectl get nodes`&lt;/code&gt; which will confirm that your kubeconfig (typically located at &lt;code&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/code&gt;) is correctly configured to the `docker-desktop` context and your single-node cluster is up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get nodes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME             STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker-desktop   Ready    master   32m   v1.13.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Install Kubernetes Dashboard&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes dashboard is a web-based user interface that allows you to manage your cluster and its resources. Containerized applications can be deployed and troubleshooted. The Kubernetes dashboard shows the current state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster as well as any faults that may have occurred. The Kubernetes dashboard can be used to reinforce your understanding of how Istio runs. The easiest and most common way to access the cluster is through &lt;code&gt;kubectl proxy&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a local web server that securely proxies data to the Kubernetes dashboard through the Kubernetes API server. Execute the following command to deploy the Kubernetes dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/aio/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once deployed, you can access the Kubernetes dashboard using the kubectl command-line tool by running the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl proxy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command creates a local web server that uses the Kubernetes API server to securely proxy data to the Kubernetes dashboard. It&amp;#x27;s important to note that the Kubernetes dashboard can only be accessed from the machine where the command is executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;kubectl proxy --help&lt;/code&gt; for more options and the Kubernetes dashboard documentation for more information. &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; will make the Kubernetes dashboard available at &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dashboard deploys with a minimal RBAC configuration by default to secure your cluster data. Only a Bearer Token is currently supported for logging into the Kubernetes dashboard. Create a sample user and use its token, or use an existing token provided by your Docker Desktop deployment, and then run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl -n kube-system describe secret $(kubectl -n kube-system get secret | awk &amp;#x27;/default-token/ {print $1}&amp;#x27;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will print something similar to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Name:         default-token-tktcn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Namespace:    kube-system&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Labels:       &amp;lt;none&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Annotations:  kubernetes.io/service-account.name: default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;              kubernetes.io/service-account.uid: 3a0a68b1-4abd-11e9-8561-025000000001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

After downloading the distribution for your operating system, extract the compressed file to a directory and acquaint yourself with the contents of the distribution, regardless of the operating system you&amp;#x27;re using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each release includes &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt;, configuration samples, a sample application and platform-specific installation resources. &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; is a command line utility for service operators to debug and diagnose their Istio service mesh. Alternatively, &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; can be installed via your preferred  package manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explore release contents on MacOS or Linux by changing directory to “istio-x.x.x”. For example: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ cd istio-1.1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This directory contains the files necessary for installing Istio, sample files and also &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt;, an important command-line tool used to manage your Istio deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ ls -l&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;total 48&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;-rw-r--r--   1  user  staff  11343 Mar 18 16:08 LICENSE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;-rw-r--r--   1  user  staff   5921 Mar 18 16:08 README.md&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;drwxr-xr-x   3  user  staff     96 Mar 18 16:08 bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;drwxr-xr-x   7  user  staff    224 Mar 18 16:08 install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;-rw-r--r--   1  user  staff    602 Mar 18 16:08 istio.VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;drwxr-xr-x  16  user  staff    512 Mar 18 16:08 samples&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;drwxr-xr-x  21  user  staff    672 Mar 18 16:08 tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installation directory contains Istio installation &lt;code&gt;YAML&lt;/code&gt; files for Kubernetes in &lt;code&gt;install/&lt;/code&gt;, sample applications in &lt;code&gt;samples/&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; client binary in the &lt;code&gt;bin/&lt;/code&gt; directory. The &lt;code&gt;istio.VERSION&lt;/code&gt; configuration file contains a list of Istio components and their version numbers for the release’s distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; is the Istio configuration command line utility. &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; is used for setting routing rules, policies, and injecting Envoy as a service proxy manually, among other things.

Typically, installations fit into one of the following categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Choice of Security Configuration&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install with strict mutual TLS authentication.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended for fresh kubernetes cluster. This method enforces authentication between sidecars by default.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Install with permissive mutual TLS authentication between sidecars.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended if you have existing clusters and services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended if you have applications where services with an Istio sidecar need to be able to communicate with other non-Istio Kubernetes services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Custom deployments that include or exclude certain default Istio components.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended if a function of one of Istio’s components isn’t necessary or desired in your environment (e.g. removal of Citadel if mTLS is not to be used).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Choice of Deployment Utility&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Render Kubernetes manifests directly with kubectl.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended for understanding Istio’s underpinnings more explicitly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Render Kubernetes manifests with a package / configuration management system like Helm or Ansible.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Recommended for production deployments with templated configuration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Registering Istio’s Custom Resources&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the following command to apply Istio’s CustomResourceDefinition objects to your cluster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ for i in install/kubernetes/helm/istio-init/files/crd*yaml; do kubectl apply -f $i; done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This installation does not leverage Helm (a package manager for Kubernetes). The generally preferred method for any installation of Istio that may find its way into production is to use Helm or Ansible; both included in the distribution you just downloaded. With Helm or Ansible you get more flexibility in which components you install and can fine-tune your setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl  api-resources | grep istio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;meshpolicies                                   authentication.istio.io        false        MeshPolicy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;policies                                       authentication.istio.io        true         Policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;adapters                                       config.istio.io                true         adapter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;apikeys                                        config.istio.io                true         apikey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;attributemanifests                             config.istio.io                true         attributemanifest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;authorizations                                 config.istio.io                true         authorization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bypasses                                       config.istio.io                true         bypass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;checknothings                                  config.istio.io                true         checknothing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;circonuses                                     config.istio.io                true         circonus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;cloudwatches                                   config.istio.io                true         cloudwatch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istio actually registers new types of resources, Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) which represent things like Gateways or Services.

If you have existing services or applications in your Kubernetes cluster, it is recommended to use mTLS permissive mode. If you&amp;#x27;re setting up a fresh cluster, security best practises recommend using &lt;code&gt;istio-demo-auth.yaml&lt;/code&gt; to encrypt service traffic between sidecars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please wait for a few minutes to let the installation run, for the Docker images to properly download and for the deployments to succeed. The application of this extensive yaml file has Kubernetes realize many new Custom Resource Definitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might also use &lt;code&gt;istio-demo-auth.yaml&lt;/code&gt;, which enforces mutual TLS authentication between all clients and servers. You might consider that initial deployment of Istio with strict mTLS enforcement configured is most successfully used within fresh Kubernetes cluster where all workloads will be Istio-enabled. To apply Istio setup with mutual TLS authentication, use the command below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl apply -f install/kubernetes/istio-demo-auth.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istio&amp;#x27;s control plane is installed in its own istio-system namespace, and it supervises services in all other namespaces with sidecar proxies, or in other words, all other namespaces with services on the mesh. The control plane is deployed in the istio-system namespace act as a cluster-wide, which means that behaves in a single-tenant fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get namespaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME           STATUS   AGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;default        Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker         Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;istio-system   Active   2m15s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-public    Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-system    Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verify installation of the control plane into the &lt;code&gt;istio-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace using commands:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get namespaces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME           STATUS   AGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;default        Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker         Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;istio-system   Active   2m15s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-public    Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-system    Active   49d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

You may not have noticed service proxies prior to deploying the sample application, and thus the data plane, because we have not deployed any services (applications) to run on the mesh. You may believe that no proxies are running, but you would be overlooking the fact that two proxies are already running. Our service proxy is up and operating on both the ingress and egress gateways. Let&amp;#x27;s have a look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deploy Sample Application&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s get started by deploying our first set of services (an application) to the service mesh. We&amp;#x27;ll utilise BookInfo, an Istio sample application that demonstrates many aspects of the value proposition of service meshes. The Kubernetes manifest files for BookInfo may be found in the &lt;code&gt;samples/bookinfo/&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory in your release distribution folder.  Let&amp;#x27;s take a moment to familiarise with this application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To populate the page, users call the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; microservice, which then calls the &lt;code&gt;details&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; microservices. The book information can be found in the &lt;code&gt;details&lt;/code&gt; microservice. The &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; microservice contains book reviews and subsequently calls the &lt;code&gt;ratings&lt;/code&gt; microservice to retrieve reviews. The &lt;code&gt;ratings&lt;/code&gt; microservice contains book ranking in the form of a 1 to 5 star book review.  There are three versions of the &lt;code&gt;reviews&lt;/code&gt; microservice: Each of the four application services are written in a different language - Python, Ruby, Java, Nodejs, which further demonstrates the value of a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;reviews v1 has no ratings (does not call the ratings service).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reviews v2 has ratings of 1 to 5 black stars (calls the ratings service).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;reviews v3 has ratings of 1 to 5 red stars (calls the ratings service).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application does not need to be changed to run the sample using Istio. Instead, we&amp;#x27;ll configure and run the services in an Istio-enabled environment, with service proxies injected alongside each service as sidecars. Istio&amp;#x27;s service proxies can be injected as sidecars to application services either manually or automatically. As we deploy our sample application, let&amp;#x27;s have a look at how automated sidecar injection works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Deploying Sample App with Automatic Sidecar Injection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istio will deploy a sidecar injector in order to have Envoy deployed as sidecars to each of our services. Let&amp;#x27;s check for the presence of the sidecar injector deployment and its namespace label, which specifies that pods in a specific namespace will have sidecar injected automatically upon deployment (admission):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot;

Deleting the istio-system removes Istio’s control plane components, but leaves CRDs, sidecars and other artifacts resident in your cluster. Uninstalling Istio is as simple as executing this command from within your istio release folder:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl delete -f install/kubernetes/istio-demo.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will not delete all of the Istio custom resource definitions, mesh configuration and sample application, however.

Start contributing and keep contributing. Community members who consistently contribute are the first individuals to be awarded internships when new internship opportunities open up - particularly members who are making significantly impactful contributions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand that internships are assigned as a recognition of work that you are already performing. They are not assigned in the hopes of you becoming a good contributor, but are awarded to support and reinforce efforts that you are already giving. Engage and make an impact on an area of a project. Show your passion for helping move the project forward, willingness to work hard, and capacity to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognize that there are many hundreds of contributors and relatively few maintainers and MeshMates. If you don&amp;#x27;t get an immediate response, don&amp;#x27;t lose heart. Be tenacious and find a piece of one of the projects to be engaged with and advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/meshmates&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 IBuPZ appion__btn faqbutton&quot; title=&quot;Engage a MeshMate&quot;&gt; Engage a MeshMate&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 cwuCUo accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 euxeaJ accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 ilNMiK&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-1&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-1&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jCBZFW&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;How often does Layer5 offer internships?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__OpenIcon-sc-zq6yo-2 eqQQKC&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 217.9L383 345c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0 9.4-9.4 9.3-24.6 0-34L273 167c-9.1-9.1-23.7-9.3-33.1-.7L95 310.9c-4.7 4.7-7 10.9-7 17s2.3 12.3 7 17c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0l127.1-127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__CloseIcon-sc-zq6yo-3 fVIWdl&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 294.1L383 167c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0s9.3 24.6 0 34L273 345c-9.1 9.1-23.7 9.3-33.1.7L95 201.1c-4.7-4.7-7-10.9-7-17s2.3-12.3 7-17c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l127.1 127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemPanel&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionBodyWrapper-sc-zq6yo-6 llPzmQ accordion__body&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-1&quot; hidden=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuously.

These interns freely help other contributors, understanding that 1) they learn as they teach and assist others, 2) their projects are futhered with more contributors engage, and 3) any contributors path to maintainership is one of enabling others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful interns steward projects naturally as they become a resource to other contributors. These interns frequently become component and/or core maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful interns internalize the fact that the real value of engaging and contributing to projects is the experience gained. They understand that the experience is theirs for the taking and that project maintainers and Layer5 employees want you to seize the opportunity. We consider your success our success and embrace the concept that your meaningful engagement is to all our benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/community&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 IBuPZ appion__btn faqbutton&quot; title=&quot;Hear from other interns&quot;&gt; Hear from other interns&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 cwuCUo accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 euxeaJ accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 ilNMiK&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-3&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-3&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jCBZFW&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;What are accomplishments of successful interns?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__OpenIcon-sc-zq6yo-2 eqQQKC&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 217.9L383 345c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0 9.4-9.4 9.3-24.6 0-34L273 167c-9.1-9.1-23.7-9.3-33.1-.7L95 310.9c-4.7 4.7-7 10.9-7 17s2.3 12.3 7 17c9.4 9.4 24.6 9.4 33.9 0l127.1-127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__CloseIcon-sc-zq6yo-3 fVIWdl&quot;&gt;&lt;svg stroke=&quot;currentColor&quot; fill=&quot;currentColor&quot; stroke-width=&quot;0&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 512 512&quot; color=&quot;white&quot; style=&quot;color:white&quot; height=&quot;22&quot; width=&quot;22&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M256 294.1L383 167c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0s9.3 24.6 0 34L273 345c-9.1 9.1-23.7 9.3-33.1.7L95 201.1c-4.7-4.7-7-10.9-7-17s2.3-12.3 7-17c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l127.1 127z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemPanel&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionBodyWrapper-sc-zq6yo-6 llPzmQ accordion__body&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; id=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-3&quot; hidden=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Layer5 interns speak at large, public technology conferences like KubeCon, DockerCon, and so on.

We expect earnest effort from its contributors. What “earnest effort” means is different for each community member as all have different circumstances. Suffice to say, the more you put into your efforts, the greater your reward will be. Most community contributors stay with the project for many months, if not indefinitely. Length of involvement is entirely up to the individual community member. You can expect to be challenged, to be assisted, to learn, to be recognized for your effort and to have your contributions appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a member of the Layer5 community, you are expected to be a good representative of Layer5&amp;#x27;s cultures and values of helping fellow members and paying it forward as we all learn together. You are expected to offer your ideas and skills to help advance our community and its projects. You are expected to share your experiences with others, to be curious, to be helpful, to ask questions, to challenge others and to be challenged yourself, to spread the word about what we collectively do here, to invite new members, to learn, to share, to make friends, to build a network, to write blog posts, to tweet, to become maintainers, to become MeshMates, to earn an internship, to get hired by Layer5 - - any and all of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;faqbutton&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/community/meshmates&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 IBuPZ appion__btn faqbutton&quot; title=&quot;Reach out to a MeshMate to find out more&quot;&gt; Reach out to a MeshMate to find out more&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItem&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemWrapper-sc-zq6yo-1 cwuCUo accordion__item&quot;&gt;&lt;div data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemHeading&quot; class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionTitleWrapper-sc-zq6yo-4 euxeaJ accordion__header&quot; role=&quot;heading&quot; aria-level=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__AccordionItemButtonWrapper-sc-zq6yo-5 ilNMiK&quot; id=&quot;accordion__heading-raa-7&quot; aria-disabled=&quot;false&quot; aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot; aria-controls=&quot;accordion__panel-raa-7&quot; role=&quot;button&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; data-accordion-component=&quot;AccordionItemButton&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;accordionstyle__IconWrapper-sc-zq6yo-7 jCBZFW&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;I see works of other contributors being highlighted.

At their core, service meshes provide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A services-first network; A developer-driven network;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A network that is primarily concerned with alleviating application developers from building infrastructure concerns into their application code; A network that empowers operators with the ability to declaratively define network behavior, node identity, and traffic flow through policy;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A network that enables service owners to control application logic without engaging developers to change its code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Value derived from the layer of tooling that service meshes provide is most evident in the land of microservices.

The promises of immediate view to top-level service metrics, detailed traffic control, and automated authentication and encryption across all services without having to do either:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;change your application code&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;change your deployment manifests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the canonical sample application BookInfo you can see how service proxies come into play and form a mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/bookinfo-with-proxies-d74c061a66b678cac53cb59ac1c6ad66.svg&quot; class=&quot;image-left&quot; alt=&quot;BookInfo with proxies&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kubernetes, automatic proxy injection is implemented as a webhook using a Kubernetes API Server with the Mutating Webhook Admission Controller. It is stateless, relying solely on the injection template and mesh configuration configmaps and the to-be-injected pod object. It can be easily horizontally scaled, either manually via the deployment object or automatically via a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istio addresses one of the most well-known distributed systems issues: the lack of homogeneous, reliable, and unchanging networks. It accomplishes this by using lightweight proxies  deployed between your application containers and the network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gateways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingress and egress gateways were first introduced in Istio 0.8. Ingress and egress gateways are symmetrically similar and serve as reverse and forward proxies for traffic entering and leaving the mesh, respectively. Istio Gateways&amp;#x27; behavior, like that of other Istio components, is defined and controlled through configuration, allowing you to specify which traffic to let in and out of the service mesh, at what rate, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ingress&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuration of ingress gateways allow you to define traffic entryways into the service mesh for incoming traffic to flow through. Consider that ingressing traffic into the mesh is a reverse proxy situation - akin to traditional web server load balancing. The configuration for egressing traffic out of the mesh is a forward proxy situation (similar to traditional) in which you determine which traffic to allow out of the mesh and where it should be routed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the following Gateway configuration sets up a proxy to act as a load balancer exposing port 80 and 9080 (http), 443 (https), and port 2379 (TCP) for ingress. The gateway will be applied to the proxy running on a pod with labels app: my-gateway-controller. While Istio will configure the proxy to listen on these ports, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that external traffic to these ports are allowed into the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-yaml&quot;

Set the following configuration in the sidecar injector, which will identify cluster-local networks and keep traffic destined locally within the mesh, while forwarding traffic for all other destinations externally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-yaml&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;set global.proxy.includeIPRanges=&amp;quot;10.0.0.1/24&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;External requests bypass the sidecar and route directly to the intended destination once this configuration is deployed and istio proxies are updated. Only internal requests within the cluster will be intercepted and managed by the Istio sidecar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Route through an Egress Gateway&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istio monitoring and route rules can be applied to traffic leaving the mesh through an egress gateway. It also enables communication between applications running in a cluster where the nodes lack public IP addresses, preventing the mesh&amp;#x27;s applications from accessing the Internet. The nodes (and the applications running on them) can access external services in a regulated manner by defining an egress gateway, directing all egress traffic through it, and allocating public IPs to the egress gateway nodes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/istio-architecture-838f742c50872372913c7414557ffc7a.svg&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; alt=&quot;Istio Architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why use Istio Gateways and not Kubernetes Ingresses?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the Istio v1alpha3 APIs leverage Gateways for richer functionality as Kubernetes Ingress has proven insufficient for Istio applications. In comparison to Kubernetes Ingress, Istio Gateways can function as a pure L4 TCP proxy and support all protocols supported by Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another factor to examine is the division of trust domains between organizational teams. Kubernetes Ingress API combines specification for L4 to L7, which makes it challenging for different teams in organizations with separate trust domains (such as SecOps, NetOps, ClusterOps and Developers) to own Ingress traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Istio Authorization Policy]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

With this knowledge, you should be able to debug and resolve the vast majority of issues that new and intermediate Istio users encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an Istio deployment, Pilot is in charge of programming the data plane, ingress and egress gateways, and service proxies. Pilot models a deployment environment by combining Istio configuration from Galley  with service information from a service registry, such as the Kubernetes API server or Consul. Pilot utilises this model to produce data plane configuration and pushes it out to the fleet of service proxies that are connected to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Configuring Pilot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s look at the surface area of Pilot&amp;#x27;s configuration to understand better all aspects of the mesh that concerns it. As we process this, keep in mind that Pilot&amp;#x27;s dependency on Galley for the underlying platform and environment information will grow as the Istio project progresses. Pilot has three primary sources of configuration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mesh Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mesh configuration is a set of global configuration that is static for the installation of the mesh. Mesh configuration is split over three API objects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshConfig (&lt;code&gt;mesh.istio.io/v1alpha1.MeshConfig&lt;/code&gt;) - MeshConfig allows you to configure how Istio components communicate with one another, where configuration sources are located, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ProxyConfig (&lt;code&gt;mesh.istio.io/v1alpha1.ProxyConfig&lt;/code&gt;) - ProxyConfig tracks where Envoy&amp;#x27;s bootstrap configuration is located, which ports to bind to, and other options concerned with initialising Envoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshNetworks (&lt;code&gt;mesh.istio.io/v1alpha1.MeshNetworks&lt;/code&gt;) - MeshNetworks is a collection of networks across which the mesh is deployed, together with the addresses of each network&amp;#x27;s ingress gateways.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshConfig is generally used to define whether policy and/or telemetry are enabled, where to load configuration and locality-based load balancing settings. The exhaustive set of concerns that MeshConfig contains is listed below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to user Mixer?&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The addresses of the policy and telemetry servers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether policy checks are enabled at runtime&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether to fail open or closed when Mixer Policy is inaccessible or returns an error&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether to perform policy checks on the client side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether to use session affinity to target the same Mixer Telemetry instance. Session affinity is always enabled for Mixer Policy (performance of the system relies on it!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to configure service proxies for listening?&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ports to bind to to accept traffic (i.e. the port IPTables redirects to) and to accept HTTP PROXY requests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TCP connection timeout and keepalive settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access log format, output file, and encoding (JSON or text)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether to allow all outbound traffic, or restrict outbound traffic to only services Pilot knows about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Where to listen for secrets from Citadel (the SDS API), and how to bootstrap trust (in environments with local machine tokens)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whether to support Kubernetes Ingress resources&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The set of configuration sources for all Istio components (e.g. the local file system, or Galley), and how to communicate with them (the address, whether to use TLS or not, which secrets, etc)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locality-based load balancing settings—configuration about failover and traffic splits between zones and regions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;ProxyConfig is mostly used for customising bootstrap settings for Envoy. The exhaustive set of concerns that ProxyConfig contains is the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The location of the file with Envoy’s bootstrap configuration, as well as the location of the Envoy binary itself&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The location of the trace collector (i.e. where to send trace data)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shutdown settings (both connection draining and hot restart)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The location of Envoy’s xDS server (Pilot) and how to communicate with it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Envoy’s service cluster, meaning the name of the service this Envoy is sidecar for&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Which ports to host the proxy’s admin server and statsd listener&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Envoy’s concurrency (number of worker threads)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connection timeout settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Envoy binds the socket to intercept traffic (either via IPTables REDIRECT or TPROXY)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshNetworks defines a collection of named networks, the method for sending traffic into those networks (ingress), and their locality. A CIDR range or a set of endpoints returned by a service registry define each network (e.g. the Kubernetes API server). The API object ServiceEntry, which is used to define services in Istio, has a set of endpoints. A ServiceEntry can represent a service that is deployed across multiple networks(or clusters) by labelling each endpoint with a network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most values in MeshConfig cannot be updated dynamically, therefore the control plane must be restarted for them to take effect. Similarly, updates to values in ProxyConfig only occur when Envoy is redeployed (e.g., in Kubernetes, when the pod is rescheduled). MeshNetworks can be dynamically upgraded at runtime without requiring any control plane components to be restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Kubernetes, the majority of MeshConfig and ProxyConfig configuration is concealed behind options in the Helm installation, although not all of it is exposed via Helm. To have complete control over the installation, you&amp;#x27;ll need to post-process the file output by Helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Networking Configuration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Networking configuration is Istio’s bread and butter—the configuration to manage how traffic flows through the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Istio&amp;#x27;s networking APIs revolve around ServiceEntry. ServiceEntry defines a service by its names—the set of hostnames clients use to call the service. DestinationRules define how clients communicate with a service: what load balancing, outlier detection, circuit breaking, and connection pooling strategies to use, which TLS settings to use, etc. VirtualServices configure how traffic flows to a service: L7 and L4 routing, traffic shaping, retries, timeouts, etc. Gateways configure how services are exposed outside of the mesh: what hostnames are routed to which services, how to serve certs for those hostnames, etc. Service proxies configure how services are exposed inside of the mesh, which services are available to which clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Service Discovery&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilot integrates with different service discovery systems, such as the Kubernetes API server, Consul, and Eureka, to discover service and endpoint information about the local environment. Adapters in Pilot consume service discovery data from their source and synthesize ServiceEntry objects. For example, the integration with Kubernetes uses the Kubernetes SDK to watch the API server for service creation and service endpoint update events. The registry adapter in Pilot creates a ServiceEntry object based on this data. That ServiceEntry is used to update Pilot’s internal model and generate an updated configuration for the data plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilot registry adapters were previously implemented in Golang.  These adapters can now be detached from Pilot with the introduction of Galley. A service discovery adapter reads an existing service registry and produces a set of ServiceEntry objects as a separate job (or an offline process done by a continuous integration system). Those ServiceEntries can then be supplied to Galley as files and uploaded to the Kubernetes API server. Alternatively, you can create your own Mesh Config Protocol server and feed Galley the ServiceEntries. Static ServiceEntries can be useful to enable Istio in largely static environments (e.g., legacy VM-based deployments with rarely-changing IP addresses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ServiceEntries bind a set of hostnames to endpoints to construct a Service. IP addresses or DNS names can be those endpoints. A network, locality, and weight can be assigned to each endpoint individually. ServiceEntries can define complex network topologies as a result of this. A service deployed across separate clusters (with different networks) that are geographically disparate (have different localities) can be created and have traffic split amongst its members by percentage (weights)—or in fact, by nearly any feature of the request.  Since Istio knows where distant networks&amp;#x27; ingress points are, when a service endpoint in a remote network is selected, the service proxy will route traffic to the remote network&amp;#x27;s ingress. We can even write policies to prefer local endpoints over endpoints in other localities but automatically failover to other localities if local endpoints are unhealthy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Config Serving&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilot constructs a model of the environment and state of a deployment using these three config sources—mesh config, networking config, and service discovery. As service proxy instances are deployed into the cluster, they connect to Pilot asynchronously. Pilot groups the service proxies based on their labels and the service to which they are sidecarred. Pilot creates Discovery Service (xDS) responses for each group of connected service proxies using this paradigm. Pilot transmits the current state of the environment and the configuration that reflects the environment when a service proxy connects. The model is updated regularly due to the generally dynamic nature of the underlying platform(s). Updates to the model mean updating the current set of xDS configurations. When the Discovery Service config is changed, Pilot computes the groups of affected service proxies and pushes the updated configuration to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service proxy (Envoy) configuration can be divided into two main groups: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Listeners and Routes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clusters and Endpoints&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listeners define a set of filters (for example, an HTTP filter delivers Envoy&amp;#x27;s HTTP functionality) and how Envoy connects those filters to a port. These are of two types: physical and virtual. A physical listener is one where Envoy binds to the specified port. A virtual listener accepts traffic from a physical listener without binding to a port (instead, some physical listener must direct traffic to it). Listeners and Routes work together to configure how a Listener routes traffic to a specified Cluster (e.g., by matching on HTTP path or SNI name). A cluster is a collection of endpoints that includes information on how to contact them (TLS settings, load balancing strategy, connection pool settings, etc.).  A Cluster is analogous to a &amp;quot;service.&amp;quot; Finally, Endpoints are individual network hosts (IP addresses or DNS names) that Envoy will forward traffic to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Troubleshooting Pilot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the state of service proxies connected to Pilot, see these endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/edsz&lt;/code&gt; - prints all of Pilot’s set of pre-computed EDS responses; i.e. the endpoints it sends to each connected service proxy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/adsz&lt;/code&gt; - prints the set of listeners, routes, and clusters pushed to each service proxy connected to Pilot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/cdsz&lt;/code&gt; - prints the set of clusters pushed to each service proxy connected to Pilot&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/synz&lt;/code&gt; - print the status of ADS, CDS, and EDS connections of all service proxies connected to pilot. In particular this shows the last nonce Pilot is working with vs the last nonce Envoy has ACK’d, showing which Envoys are not accepting configuration updates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine Pilot’s understanding of the state of the world (its service registries), see these endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/registryz&lt;/code&gt; - print the set of services Pilot knows about across all registries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/endpointz[?brief=1]&lt;/code&gt; - print the endpoints for every service Pilot knows about, including their ports, protocols, service accounts, labels, etc. If you provide the brief flag, the output will be a human-readable table (as opposed to a JSON blob for the normal version). This is a legacy endpoint and &lt;code&gt;/debug/endpointShardz&lt;/code&gt; provides strictly more information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/endpointShardz&lt;/code&gt; - print the endpoints for every service Pilot knows about, grouped by the registry that provided the endpoint. For example, if the same service exists in both Consul and Kubernetes, endpoints for the service will be grouped into two shards, one each for Consul and Kubernetes. This endpoint provides everything from &lt;code&gt;/debug/endpoint&lt;/code&gt; and more, including data like the endpoint’s network, locality, load balancer weight, representation in Envoy xDS config, etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/workloadz&lt;/code&gt; - print the set of endpoints (“workloads”) connected to Pilot, and their metadata (like labels)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/configz&lt;/code&gt; - print the entire set of Istio configuration Pilot knows about. Only validated config that Pilot is using to construct its model will be returned; useful for understanding situations where Pilot is not processing new config itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also find miscellaneous endpoints with higher level debug information, be wading through these endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/authenticationz[?proxyID=pod_name.namespace]&lt;/code&gt; - prints the Istio authentication policy status of the target proxy for each host and port it’s serving, including: the name of the authentication policy affecting it, the name of the DestinationRule affecting it, whether the port expects mTLS, standard TLS, or plain text, and if settings across configuration cause a conflict for this port.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/config_dump[?proxyID=pod_name.namespace]&lt;/code&gt; - prints the listeners, routes, and clusters for the given node; this can be diff’d directly against the output of &lt;code&gt;istioctl proxy-config&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/debug/push_status&lt;/code&gt; - prints the status of each connected endpoint as of Pilot’s last push period; includes the status of each connected proxy, when the push period began (and ended), and the identities assigned to each port of each host.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tracing Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this section, we’ll use some tools to understand the before-and-after of Istio configuration and the resultant xDS configuration pushed to service proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listeners&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gateways and VirtualServices results in Listeners for Envoy. Gateways result in physical listeners (listeners that bind to a port on the network), while VirtualServices result in virtual listeners (listeners that do not bind to a port, but instead receive traffic from physical listeners).

Configuring different TLS settings within the Gateway also changes the generated Listener configuration. For each protocol you use, you&amp;#x27;ll notice a protocol-specific filter configured in the Listener (for HTTP, this is the http connection manager and its router, for MongoDB another, for TCP another, and so on). To explore how different combinations of hosts in the Gateway and VirtualService interact, we also recommend exploring different combinations of hosts in the Gateway and VirtualService.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Routes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve seen how VirtualServices cause Listeners to be created. In Envoy, the majority of the configuration you specify in VirtualServices manifests as Routes. Routes exist in a variety of flavors, with a set of routes for each protocol supported by Envoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl proxy-config route istio-ingressgateway_PODNAME -o json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

The service proxy allows applications to send and receive messages as method calls via a channel. Service proxy connections can be created as needed or persist open connections to facilitate pooling. Applications are oblivious to the data plane's existence. As applications conduct service-to-service calls, service proxies are transparently inserted. Inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) cluster network traffic are handled by data planes.

In Istio, traffic is transparently intercepted using iptables rules and redirected to the service proxy."), mdx("p", null, "Remember that Pilot configures traffic policy and service proxies implement it. The data plane is a collection of service proxies. Service proxies are responsible for health checks, routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, and the production of observable signals by intercepting every packet in the request.

Envoy's runtime configuration has always been API-driven, allowing it to drain and hot reload its own process with an old configuration with a new process and new configuration (displacing itself). Envoy achieves hot reloading of its processes by shared memory and communication through a Unix Domain Socket (UDS), in a manner that resembles GitHub's tool for zero-downtime HAProxy reloads.

The service proxy allows applications to send and receive messages as method calls via a channel. Service proxy connections can be created as needed or persist open connections to facilitate pooling. Applications are oblivious to the data plane&amp;#x27;s existence. As applications conduct service-to-service calls, service proxies are transparently inserted. Inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) cluster network traffic are handled by data planes. Whether traffic is entering the mesh (ingressing) or leaving the mesh (egressing), application service traffic is directed first to the service proxy for handling. In Istio, traffic is transparently intercepted using iptables rules and redirected to the service proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that Pilot configures traffic policy and service proxies implement it. The data plane is a collection of service proxies. Service proxies are responsible for health checks, routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, and the production of observable signals by intercepting every packet in the request. As the service may change from location to location, proxies provide indirection so that clients may point to the same location (e.g., proxy.example.com), representing a permanent reference. They add resilience to distributed systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Envoy Proxy Overview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The versatile and performant Envoy has evolved as an open source, application-level service proxy, living up to its tagline as the universal data plane API. Lyft developed Envoy in order to solve major distributed systems problems. Envoy has had broad reuse and has been integrated into the cloud native ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why Envoy?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy was originally intended to be used as an edge proxy rather than a sidecar. Envoy transitioned to the sidecar pattern over time. The concept of hot reloads vs. hot restarts was at the center of the decision for the Istio project to leverage Envoy. Envoy&amp;#x27;s runtime configuration has always been API-driven, allowing it to drain and hot reload its own process with an old configuration with a new process and new configuration (displacing itself). Envoy achieves hot reloading of its processes by shared memory and communication through a Unix Domain Socket (UDS), in a manner that resembles GitHub&amp;#x27;s tool for zero-downtime HAProxy reloads. Additionally, and uniquely, Envoy offers an Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS) for delivering the data for each xDS API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;HTTP/2 and gRPC&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy stood apart from other proxies at the time because of its early support for HTTP/2 and gRPC. HTTP/2 significantly improves on HTTP/1.1 in that HTTP/2 enables request multiplexing over a single TCP connection. Proxies that support HTTP/2 benefit from the reduced overhead of combining several connections into a single one. HTTP/2 allows clients to send numerous parallel requests and load resources preemptively using server-push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy is HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 compatible, including proxying compatibility for both downstream and upstream protocols. This means Envoy can accept incoming HTTP/2 connections and proxy them to upstream HTTP/2 clusters, but it can also take HTTP/1.1 connections and proxy them to HTTP/2 clusters (and vice-versa).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;gRPC is an RPC protocol that uses protocol buffers on top of HTTP/2. Envoy supports gRPC natively (over HTTP/2) and can also bridge an HTTP/1.1 client to gRPC. Envoy has the ability to operate as a gRPC-JSON transcoder. The gRPC-JSON transcoder functionality allows a client to send HTTP/1.1 requests with a JSON payload to Envoy, which translates the request into the corresponding gRPC call and subsequently translates the response message back into JSON. These are powerful capabilities (and challenging to execute correctly), which set Envoy apart from other service proxies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Envoy in Istio&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an out of process proxy, Envoy transparently forms the base unit of the mesh. Akin to proxies in other service meshes, it is the workhorse of Istio. Istio deploys Envoy sidecarred to application services. Identified as &lt;code&gt;istio-proxy&lt;/code&gt; in deployment files, Envoy does not require root privileges to run, but runs as user 1337 (non root).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Sidecar Injection (or Sidecarring)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two steps to adding a service proxy: sidecar injection and network capture. Sidecar injection is the method of adding a proxy to a given application. Network capture is the method of directing inbound traffic to the proxy (instead of the application) and outbound traffic to the proxy (instead of directly back to the client or directly to subsequent upstream application services).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Manual Sidecar Injection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Istioctl&lt;/code&gt; can be used to manually inject the Envoy sidecar definition into Kubernetes manifests manually. Use &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code&gt;kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; capability to manually inject the sidecar into deployment manifests by manipulating yaml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl kube-inject -f samples/sleep/sleep.yaml | kubectl apply -f -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can update Kubernetes specifications on-the-fly at the time of applying them to Kubernetes for scheduling.

In our example, we can see that each of BookInfo&amp;#x27;s pods is only executing one container. When &lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; is run against  on BookInfo&amp;#x27;s manifests, it adds another container to the Pod specification but does not deploy anything yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; supports modification of Pod-based Kubernetes objects (Job, DaemonSet, ReplicaSet, Pod and Deployment) that may be embedded into long yaml files containing other Kubernetes objects. &lt;code&gt;Istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; will parse the other Kubernetes objects without modification. Unsupported resources are left unmodified so it is safe to run kube-inject over a single file that contains multiple Service, ConfigMap, Deployment, etc. definitions for a complex application. It is best to do this when the resource is initially created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to onboard this existing application, we can execute &lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; against each Deployment and have a rolling update of that Deployment initiated by Kubernetes as shown below. Let’s start with the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get deployment productpage-v1 -o yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -f -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;deployment.extensions/productpage-v1 configured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;We now notice that the productpage pod has grown to two containers when we look at the BookInfo pods again. Istio’s sidecar has been successfully injected. The rest of BookInfo’s application services need to be onboarded in order for BookInfo as an application to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get pods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;details-v1-69658dcf78-nghss       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;productpage-v1-64647d4c5f-z95dl   2/2     Running   0          64s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;ratings-v1-6f97d68b6-v6wj6        1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v1-7c98dcd6dc-b974c       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v2-6677766d47-2qz2g       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;reviews-v3-79f9bcc54c-sjndp       1/1     Running   0          45m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may choose to do this manual injection operation once and persist the new manifest file with istio-proxy (Envoy) inserted instead of ad-hoc onboarding of a running application. You can create a persistent version of the sidecar injected deployment outputting the results of &lt;code&gt;istioctl kube-inject&lt;/code&gt; to a file. As Istio evolves the default sidecar configuration is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl kube-inject -f deployment.yaml -o deployment-injected.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or like so:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ istioctl kube-inject -f deployment.yaml &amp;gt; deployment-injected.yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ad-hoc Sidecarring&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidecar injection is responsible for configuring network capture. Injection and network capture can be selectively applied to enable incremental adoption of Istio. Using the BookInfo sample application as an example, let’s take the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; service as the external-facing service and selectively remove this service (and just this service out of the set of four) from the service mesh. Let&amp;#x27;s start by checking for the presence of its sidecarred service proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get pods productpage-8459b4f9cf-tfblj -o jsonpath=&amp;quot;{.spec.containers[*].image}&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;layer5/istio-bookinfo-productpage:v1 docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.0.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, productpage container is our application container, while the istio/proxy is the service proxy (Envoy) that Istio injected into the pod. To manually onboard and offboard a deployment onto and off of the service mesh, you can manipulate annotation within its Kubernetes Deployment specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl patch deployment nginx --type=json --patch=&amp;#x27;[{&amp;quot;op&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;add&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;path&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;/spec/template/metadata/annotations&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;: {&amp;quot;sidecar.istio.io/inject&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;false&amp;quot;}}]&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;deployment.extensions/productpage-v1 patched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;On opening your browser to the &lt;code&gt;productpage&lt;/code&gt; application, and you’ll find that it is still being served through Istio’s Ingress Gateway, but that its pods no longer have sidecars. Hence, the productpage app has been removed from the mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;UNAVAILABLE:upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automatic Sidecar Injection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;No code change to receive much more visibility into how your services are behaving and how they are being interacted gives Istio a magical feeling once your services are on the mesh. Automatic sidecar injection is the magical feeling you get as you go to onramp your services.Not only does automatic sidecar injection eliminate the need to alter your code, but it also eliminates the need to change your Kubernetes manifests. Automatic sidecar injection in Kubernetes relies on mutating admission webhooks. The &lt;code&gt;istio-sidecar-injector&lt;/code&gt; is added as a mutating webhook configuration resource when Istio is installed on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME                                    CREATED AT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;istio-sidecar-injector                  2019-04-18T16:35:03Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;linkerd-proxy-injector-webhook-config   2019-04-18T16:48:49Z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations istio-sidecar-injector -o yaml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

The injector service will then modify the PodSpec to include two more containers, one for the init-container to configure traffic rules and the other for istio-proxy (Envoy) to perform proxying.  The sidecar injector service uses a template to add these two additional containers; the template may be found in the &lt;code&gt;istio-sidecar-injector configmap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes lifecycle allows customization of resources before they are committed to the etcd store, the ‘source of truth’ for Kubernetes configuration. When an individual Pod is created (either via kubectl or a Deployment resource), it goes through this same lifecycle, hitting mutating admission webhooks which modify the pod before it actually gets applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kubernetes Labels&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatic sidecar injection relies on labels to identify which pods to inject Istio’s service proxy and initialize as pod on the data plane. Kubernetes objects, like pods and namespaces, can have user-defined labels attached to them. Labels are essentially &lt;code&gt;key:value&lt;/code&gt; pairs like you finding in other systems that support the concept of tags. Webhook Admission controller relies on labels to select the namespaces they apply to. Istio-injection is the specific label that Istio uses. Familiarize by labeling the default namespace with &lt;code&gt;istio-injection=enabled&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl label namespace default istio-injection=enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confirm which namespaces have the istio-injection label associated:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ kubectl get namespace -L istio-injection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;NAME           STATUS    AGE       ISTIO-INJECTION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;default        Active    1h        enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Docker         Active    1h        enabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;istio-system   Active    1h        disabled&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-public    Active    1h        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kube-system    Active    1h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that only the &lt;code&gt;istio-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace has the &lt;code&gt;istio-injection&lt;/code&gt; label assigned. By virtue of having the &lt;code&gt;istio-injection&lt;/code&gt; label and its value set to disabled, the &lt;code&gt;istio-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace will not have service proxies automatically injected into their pods upon deployment. This does not mean that pods in this namespace cannot have service proxies. It just means that service proxies won’t be automatically injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One caveat to watch out for, when using the &lt;code&gt;namespaceSelector&lt;/code&gt;, make sure that the namespace(s) you are selecting really has the label you are using. Keep in mind that the built-in namespaces like default and &lt;code&gt;kube-system&lt;/code&gt; don’t have labels out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the namespace in the metadata section is the actual name of the namespace, not a label:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 dmwFhm&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 eJDaax prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kind: NetworkPolicy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;metadata:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  name: test-network-policy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  namespace: default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;spec:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 bFANTz&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kubernetes Init Containers&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very similar to cloud-init for those familiar with VM provisioning, init containers in Kubernetes allows you to run temporary containers to perform a task before engaging your primary container(s).

As a result, data plane traffic should never have source or destination IP addresses that are assigned to network elements like routers and switches; instead, it should be originated from and delivered to end devices like PCs and servers. To forward data plane traffic as swiftly as possible, routers and switches use hardware chips called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). A forwarding information base is referenced by the physical networking data plane (FIB).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The destination hosts to which traffic is being sent it could be a DNS name with wildcard prefix or an IP address depending on the platform.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gateways&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The names of gateways and sidecars that should apply all these routes.

The infrastructure and practices by which your software is continuously deployed and operated — your application delivery — is the fulcrum of your organization’s digital transformation. Likely you are progressing on your cloud native journey — that is, transitioning from monolithic to container-based microservices architectures with the goal of achieving agility, portability, and on-demand scalability. Kubernetes is the platform of choice for many, providing the automation and control necessary to manage microservices-based applications at scale and with high velocity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the network part and parcel to each and every service request in your microservices-based application, it may come as no surprise that at the core of application delivery is your application delivery controller, an intelligent proxy that accelerates and manages application delivery. With no standard definition of what an application delivery controller does, the capabilities of intelligent proxies vary broadly. And so in this white paper, we’ll explore application delivery controllers as they relate to your architecture choices, your use of Kubernetes platforms, and open source tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 Key Considerations for Microservices-Based Application Delivery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before embarking on your cloud native journey, it is essential to critically assess your organization’s readiness with regard to skill set so that you can choose the solutions that best fit the business objective you are seeking to meet in context of your ability to do so. There are seven key considerations to address when planning your microservices-based application delivery design:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architecting your foundation the right way &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Openly integrating with the cloud native ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing the perfect proxy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing your applications and APIs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enabling CI/CD and canary deployment with advanced traffic steering &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Achieving holistic observability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing monoliths and microservices&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thorough evaluation of these seven considerations is best done with specific tasks and goals in mind. Depending on the size and diversity of your organization, you may need to account for a variety of stakeholders’ needs — that is, tasks and goals that differ based on role and responsibility. In context of application delivery, let’s survey the most common roles with a generalized view of their responsibilities and needs as stakeholders. To help facilitate a general understanding, we’ve grouped some roles when responsibilities overlap across multiple teams:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Platform&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform teams are responsible for deploying and managing their Kubernetes infrastructure. They are responsible for platform governance, operational efficiency, and developer agility. The platform team is the connective tissue among various teams like DevOps, SREs, developers, and network operations teams and therefore must address and balance the unique needs of a diverse group of stakeholders, or influencers, when choosing cloud native solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DevOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DevOps teams are responsible for continuously deploying applications. They care about faster development and release cycles, CI/CD and automation, and canary and progressive rollout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SREs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Site reliability engineers must ensure application availability. They care about observability, incident response, and postmortems. SREs often act as architects for DevOps team and as such are often extensions of or directly belong to DevOps teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development teams are responsible for application performance and are focused on ensuring a seamless end-user experience, including troubleshooting and microservices discovery and routing. Application performance and troubleshooting is shared responsibility among multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;NetOps &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network operations teams are responsible for ensuring stable, high-performing network connectivity, resiliency, security (e.g. web application firewalls and TLS), and are commonly focused on north-south traffic. They care about establishing networking policies and enforcing compliance; achieving management, control, and monitoring of the network; and gaining visibility for the purpose of resources and capacity planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DevSecOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DevSecOps teams care about ensuring a strong security posture and rely on automated tools to orchestrate security for infrastructure, applications, containers, and API gateways. DevSecOps works very closley with NetOps team for holistic secure posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure1-6657bcb989b9255c6f56776e21b2b9ee.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Diverse Stakeholders have different needs&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each role has nuanced responsibilities. Whether you have a single person or teams of people assigned to these roles, each role’s function needs to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that these stakeholders are undergoing a transformation in their responsibilities — or at least a transformation in the way in which they perform their responsibilities. Depending upon your organization’s size and structure, your stakeholders may have clearly defined lines of accountability or not among roles. As you adopt a cloud native approach to application deployment and delivery, you may find that the once-defined lines have blurred or that they are being redrawn. Be aware that the individuals who fill these roles typically go through a period of adjustment that can be unsettling until they adapt to their own and their teams’ new identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your cloud native infrastructure should be as accommodating as possible to you, your team, and your collective responsibilities and process, so we encourage you to seek solutions that address the needs of all your stakeholders. Significantly, this includes evaluating different architectural models for as best fit for purpose. While every organization doesn’t travel the same road to cloud native, every journey starts with initial architectural decisions – decisions which have substantial bearing on your path to cloud native.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Architecting Your Foundation the Right Way&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud native novices and experts alike find that designing their application delivery architectures is the most challenging part of building microservices. Your architectural choices will have a significant impact on your cloud native journey. Some architectures will provide greater or fewer benefits while others will prove less or more difficult to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a cloud native pro or a novice, your selection of the right application delivery architecture will be one that balances the tradeoff between the greatest benefits and the simplicity needed to match your team’s skill set. Figure 1 highlights four common application delivery architecture deployment models:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Graph1-922f70168e5eac45ea8da896ca6e827d.png&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;Graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Tip: Traffic Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;North-south (N-S) traffic refers to traffic between clients outside the Kubernetes cluster and services inside the cluster, while east-west (E-W) traffic refers to traffic between services inside the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the deployment models in Figure 1 come with their list of pros and cons and are typically the point of focus of different teams. So how do you choose the right architecture for your deployment? Given the needs of your stakeholders and the many specifics involved in managing both north-south (N-S) and east-west (E-W) traffic, it is critical to assess the four different architectures with respect to the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application security &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Observability &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Continuous deployment &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scalability and performance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open source tools integration &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Service mesh &amp;amp; Istio  integration &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;IT skill set required &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine each of the four deployment models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Two-Tier Ingress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-two-tier-ingress-5c271192e7c2aec7e0cc115d2796f66e.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; alt=&quot;Two Tier Ingress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-tier ingress is the simplest architectural model to deploy to get teams up and running quickly. In this deployment model, Tthere are two layers of ADCs for N-S traffic ingress. The external ADC (at Tier 1), shown in green in Figure 2, provides L4 traffic management. Frequently, additional services are assigned to this ADC and can include web application firewall (WAF) and, secure sockets layer/transport layer security offload (SSL/TLS) functionality and authentication. A two-tier ingress deployment model is often managed by the existing network team (which is familiar with internet-facing traffic), and it can also be used as an ADC for other existing applications simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second ADC (Tier 2), shown in yellow in Figure 2, handles L7 load balancing for N-S traffic. It is managed by the platform team and is used within the Kubernetes cluster to direct traffic to the correct node. Layer 7 attributes, like information in the URL and HTTP headers, can be used for traffic load-balancing decisions. The yellow ADC continuously receives updates about the availability and respective IP addresses of the microservices pods within the Kubernetes cluster and can make decisions about which pod is best able to handle the request. Deployed as a container inside the Kubernetes cluster, the yellow ADC can be deployed as a container with Citrix CPX or with another similar product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The E-W traffic between microservices pods is managed by kube-proxy, an open source, basic L4 load balancer with simple IP address-based round robin or least connection algorithm. kube-proxy lacks advanced features like Layer 7 load balancing, security, and observability, making it a blind spot for E-W traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pros of Two-Tier Ingress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the right proxy, SSL termination can be done at the edge, and traffic can be inspected easily. This enables N-S traffic to be comprehensively secured across L3-7. ADC collects and reports telemetry on the N-S application traffic it sees, which means that this architecture provides robust observability for N-S traffic. ADC can also also integrate with CI/CD tools like Spinnaker to provide traffic management to N-S traffic for excellent continuous deployment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two-tier ingress scales very well for N-S traffic, as an example Citrix ADC reach hundreds of Gbps or even Tbps throughput through active-active clustering of ADCs if required. Integration with third-party tools like Prometheus, Grafana and Zipkin are supported out of the box with ADC, so you can continue to use the tools with which you are familiar to collect data and manage your systems for N-S traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bifurcated design of two-tier ingress makes it relatively simple to implement demarcation points for control. The network team can own and manage the green ADC, and the platform team can work inside the Kubernetes environment. Neither the network team nor the platform team needs extensive retraining, which makes this architecture quick to implement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cons of Two-Tier Ingress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations of kube-proxy have made the use of third-party tools like Project Calico necessary to provide network policies, segmentation, and security support for inter-microservices communication. Similarly, kube-proxy&amp;#x27;s lack of detailed telemetry capabilities provides very little observability for E-W traffic. kube-proxy does not have the extensive APIs to integrate with continuous deployment tools, and its basic round-robin load balancing does not provide the granular load balancing needed to incorporate a CI/CD strategy inside the cluster. In general so you lack advanced load balancing tool set required to manage your inter-pod traffic. And kube-proxy does not currently integrate with service meshes, so there is no open source control plane integration for your E-W traffic management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, two-tier ingress provides excellent services for N-S traffic but lacks control for E-W traffic. It is a popular architecture because it is simple to implement and is frequently a starting point for enterprises on their cloud native journey to microservices adoption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;By default, kube-proxy uses iptables (x_tables kernel modules), so it does not perform as well as other proxies. You can configure kube-proxy to run in different modes by setting the --proxy-mode flag. Setting this flag to ipvs enables IPVS mode (netfilter kernel modules), which provides a much improved performance and also enables choice of load balancing algorithm through the --ipvs-scheduler parameter beyond the default round robin algorithm.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unified Ingress&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-unified-ingress-e24b73fc8f6ed89ecae0a73a8483f8d8.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; height=&quot;50%&quot; alt=&quot;Unified Ingress&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unified ingress is very similar to the two-tier ingress architecture, except that it unifies two tiers of application delivery controllers (ADCs) for N-S traffic into one. Reducing an ADC tier effectively removes one hop of latency for N-S traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unified ingress has the same benefits and drawbacks as the two-tier ingress proxy architecture for security, observability, continuous deployment, scale and performance, open source tools support, and service mesh integration. Where it differs is in the skill sets required for implementation. With unified ingress, both the ADCs for N-S traffic and kube-proxy for the E-W traffic are managed by the platform team, who must be very network savvy to implement and manage this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A unified ingress proxy architecture is capable of participating in the Kubernetes cluster’s overlay network. This allows it to communicate directly with the microservices pods. Therefore, the platform team has to be knowledgeable about layers 3-7 of the network stack to take full advantage of this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, unified ingress proxy architecture is moderately simple to deploy compared to service mesh (which we will cover next), and it offers robust capabilities for N-S traffic, but has very limited functionality for E-W traffic due to the limitations of kube-proxy. A network-savvy platform team is key for implementing this architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer to control how different parts of an application communicate with one another with one another. The service mesh landscape has exploded because service meshes offer the best observability, security, and fine-grained management for traffic among microservices — that is, for E-W traffic. As an additional layer of infrastructure, service meshes do bear additional complexity as a tradeoff to the value they provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-service-mesh-9424773542766dde1581086f1363a84b.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; alt=&quot;Service Mesh&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical service mesh architecture is similar to the two-tier ingress proxy architecture for N-S traffic and offers the same rich benefits for N-S traffic. The key difference between service mesh and two-tier ingress, and where most of the value lies, is that service mesh employs a lightweight proxy as a sidecar to each microservice pod for E-W traffic. Microservices do not communicate directly: Communication among microservices happens via the sidecar, which enables inter-pod traffic to be inspected and managed as it enters and leaves the pods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using proxy sidecars, service mesh offers the highest levels of observability, security, and fine-grained traffic management and control among microservices. Additionally, select repetitive microservice functions like retries and encryption can be offloaded to the sidecars. Despite each sidecar’s being assigned its own memory and CPU resources, sidecars are typically lightweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have the option to use Citrix CPX as a sidecar. Sidecars, which are managed by the platform team and attached to each pod, create a highly scalable, distributed architecture, but they also add complexity because they result in more moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of Service Mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantages of service mesh for N-S traffic are similar to those for two-tier ingress. Service mesh, however, brings added advantages for E-W traffic.The presence of sidecars enables you to set security policies and control communication among your microservices. You can mandate things like authentication, encryption, and rate limiting for APIs among microservices if required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because E-W traffic is seen by the sidecars, there is much more telemetry to provide holistic observability for better insights and improved troubleshooting. Furthermore, Citrix CPX as a sidecar has well-defined APIs that integrate with myriad open source tools, so that you can use the observability tools you&amp;#x27;re used to. Sidecar APIs allow integration with CI/CD tools like Spinnaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, sidecars will integrate with a service mesh control plane like Istio for E-W traffic. Additionally, repetitive functions like retries and encryption can be offloaded to the sidecars. The distributed nature of the sidecar means that the solution is scalable for such features as observability and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of Service Mesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest drawback of a service mesh architecture is the complexity of implementation (managing hundreds or thousands of sidecars is not trivial). The learning curve can be steep for the platform team because there are so many moving parts. A sidecar for every pod adds to CPU and memory needs. Similarly, sidecars add latency. Latency, which may affect application performance, varies with proxy implementation and can be easily measured by the open source tool, Meshery. Citrix CPX as a sidecar offers latency as low as 1ms, whereas other solutions can add much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, a service mesh architecture provides excellent security, observability, and fine-grained traffic management for all traffic flows. The major downside is that it is complex to implement and manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Lite&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-service-mesh-lite-50ff6a2997a34a7d742ad9f5dd996e67.svg&quot; align=&quot;centre&quot; alt=&quot;Service Mesh Lite&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you want service mesh-like benefits with much less complexity?  The answer is service mesh lite, which is a variant of service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a service mesh lite architecture, the ADC shown in green in Figure 5 is responsible for Layer 4-7 load balancing for N-S traffic to handle inbound requests and load balance to the right Kubernetes cluster. The green ADC may carry out SSL termination, web application firewalling, authentication, or other network services. It is managed by the networking team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on isolation and scale requirements, service mesh lite proxy architecture uses a single or several ADCs (shown in yellow in Figure 5) that proxy communications among microservices pods to manage inter-pod (E-W) traffic rather than using individual sidecars attached to each pod. Proxies can be deployed per node or per namespace and are managed by platform teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros of Service Mesh Lite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh lite provides many of the same benefits as service mesh but reduces the overall complexity by only having a small set of proxy instances per cluster to manage the inter-pod traffic. Passing all E-W traffic through a small set of proxies provides the same advanced policy control, security, and fine-grained traffic management of a service mesh proxy architecture without all the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of service mesh lite is reduced latency as compared to service mesh because end user request goes through fewer  proxies. The main advantage is reduced complexity and the lower skill set required to implement compared to service mesh. Similar to two-tier ingress, the networking team can manage the green ADC, and the platform team can manage the yellow ADC. With service mesh lite, both teams can work in familiar environments and develop at their own speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons of Service Mesh Lite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh lite removes the implementation and management associated with service mesh, but the absence of a proxy per pod means that you sacrifice some functionality offload. For example, encryption for E-W must be implemented in each microservice, itself, if required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, service mesh lite provides most of the service mesh features but with reduced complexity and a lower IT skill set requirement. Many organizations who started with the two-tier ingress architecture find it an easy transition to service mesh lite for the added benefits it brings to their E-W traffic including better observability, enhanced security, better integration with open source tools, and support for continuous deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after reviewing the four architecture choices, you’re probably wondering: What ‘s the right architecture choice for my organization? There are no right or wrong answers. Like other architectural choices, proxy deployment models should be selected based on, in part, your application needs and your team structure and your team’s skill set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your model of proxy deployment is an important consideration, but just one of many when planning for your application delivery infrastructure. Ensuring that the application delivery components in your deployment are well-integrated into the cloud native ecosystem is your next consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Openly Integrating with the Cloud Native Ecosystem &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s imperative that your various application delivery tools and processes, including your proxy, be well-integrated into commonplace cloud native infrastructure. It’s no secret that much of today’s innovation happens in open source software. And clouds, both public and private, are built upon open source software. So in most cases, your infrastructure will be comprised of popular open source infrastructure and tools that you have picked up on your journey to cloud native. To the extent this is the case, you’ll find common integrations by categories in Figure below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/citrix-oss-integration-categories-a43533cd84808f3554b20eb4c7b6f1b7.svg&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure - Key categories of consideration for proxy integration with Kubernetes platforms and open source tools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud native environments make liberal use of open source software projects. Irrespective of which projects you use, suffice it to say that cloud native application delivery can’t be done with just containers. The combination of containers, container orchestration, and a service mesh will get you very far. And alongside a CI/CD system, these components are the most significant and ubiquitously used components of cloud native infrastructure. Integration with each of these categories of cloud native infrastructure is critical so that developers and operators can design and run systems that communicate and inter-operate as a whole. The fact that these bedrocks of cloud native infrastructure are open source unlocks their ability to be integrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the cloud native ecosystem is the extensible and scalable orchestration infrastructure that is Kubernetes. The cloud native ecosystem (both open source and closed source) extends Kubernetes by writing custom resource definitions (CRDs) and associated controllers. The controllers and CRDs give operators a Kubernetes-native way to manage all parts of their platforms — both open source and closed source. This integration affords tool unification and powerful composable intent-based primitives that truly enable a software-defined platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical to the speed of delivery is an early investment in continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD). It’s likely you have already wrangled continuous integration. Continuous deployment pipelines are your next step in seeing that changes to your source code automatically result in a new container being built and a new version of your microservice being tested and deployed to staging and eventually to production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many, the notion that CI/CD is an area of early investment is counterintuitive, and they find it hard to swallow the upfront engineering effort required to get a solid pipeline in place. The sooner CI/CD basics are implemented, however, the sooner the dividends start paying out. We will cover advanced continuous delivery considerations later in this white paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cloud native infrastructure’s being inherently dynamic (in contrast to infrastructure not driven by APIs,) the ability to observe cloud native infrastructure and its workloads is also necessary. Software is written with functionality and debugging in mind. Most often, developers use logging as the primary method for debugging their applications. Integration with Elasticsearch and Kibana is key here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance counters are another way to track application behavior and performance. Akin to SNMP for physical and virtual network monitoring, the equivalent cloud native “standard” is the use of Prometheus and Grafana, so it’s important that your application delivery solution integrate with these tools. Currently there is no recognized standard for cloud native application performance monitoring metrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;OpenMetrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloud native ecosystem needs a common format for the exchange of metrics. Observability pains grow with the release of each newly instrumented service that presents its own metric format. OpenMetrics is an effort to create an open standard for transmitting metrics at scale, with support for both text representation and protocolbBuffers. OpenMetrics builds on Prometheus’s exposition format, popular telemetry formats, and protocols used in infrastructure and application monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the metrics format, there are a few metrics that have been identified as key indicators of the health of a cloud native application (that is, the health of a service): latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Your application delivery solution should assist in producing these signals as well as provide support for the tracing of your distributed, cloud native workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned integrations with open source tools enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Citrix ADC also embodies these characteristics. All of the infrastructure integrations detailed here depend upon APIs for interchange and interoperability. Cloud native applications, too, are centered around declarative APIs to interface with the infrastructure and serve user-facing workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The endpoints that your APIs expose are now being managed by open source service meshes. Service meshes deliver the next generation of networking designed for cloud native applications. At the core of a service mesh is its data plane (its collection of proxies). Proxy selection criteria and deployment model tradeoffs are our next area of consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Check out the topic &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/service-mesh/choosing-the-perfect-proxy&quot;&gt;Choosing the Perfect Proxy&lt;/a&gt; to learn more! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Introduction to Meshery (Webinar-on-Demand)]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

The control plane includes network protocols, such as routing, signaling, and link-state protocols that are used to build and maintain the operational state of the network and provide IP connectivity between IP hosts.   As physical network control planes run in-band with network traffic, they are vulnerable to Denial of service (DoS) attacks, which can result in:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exhaustion of memory and/or buffer resources.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of routing protocol updates and keepalives.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Slow or blocked access to interactive management sessions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High CPU utilization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Routing instability, interrupted network reachability, or inconsistent packet delivery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical networking management plane is a logical entity that specifies the traffic used to access, manage, and monitor all network elements via protocols such as SNMP, SSH, HTTPS, and Telnet. All network provisioning, maintenance, and monitoring operations are supported by the management plane. Although control plane network traffic is handled in-band with all other data plane traffic, management plane traffic can be carried over an out-of-band (OOB) management network to enable separate reachability if the primary in-band IP path is unavailable (and create a security boundary). Restricting management plane access to devices on trusted networks is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical networking control and data planes are tightly coupled and generally vendor-provided as a proprietary integration of hardware and firmware. Software-defined networking (SDN) has done much to standardize and decouple. OpenvSwitch and OpenDaylight are two examples of SDN projects. We’ll see that control and data planes of service meshes are not necessarily tightly coupled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure2-1a9f1b412652dfd917052e9ac2854c73.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Mesh Topology&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 2: Mesh topology—fully connected network nodes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Physical network topologies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star, spoke-and-hub, tree (also called hierarchical), and mesh are some of the most used physical networking topologies. Nodes in mesh networks connect directly and non-hierarchically, such that each node is connected to an indefinite number (typically as many as possible or as needed dynamically) of neighbour nodes, allowing at least one path from a given node to any other node to route data efficiently .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireless is the canonical use case for physical mesh networks in which the networking medium is sensitive to line-of-sight, weather-induced, or other disruptions, and so reliability is a top priority. Mesh networks typically self-configure, allowing dynamic task distribution. This ability is especially important to mitigate the risk of failure (improving resiliency) and reacting to continuously changing topologies. It&amp;#x27;s easy to see why this network topology is the preferred design for service mesh architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service mesh network planes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh architectures typically employ the same three networking planes: data, control, and management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure3-58e1728df81b55a288fc15de629455ce.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Service mesh architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 3: An example of service mesh architecture. In Conduit’s architecture, control and data planes divide in-band and out-of-band responsibility for service traffic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh data plane (also known as the proxying layer) intercepts all packets in a request and performs health checks, routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, and generation of observable signals. Service proxies are transparently inserted, and applications are oblivious of the data plane&amp;#x27;s existence when they conduct service-to-service calls. Intra-service communication, as well as inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) service mesh traffic, are handled by data planes. Whether traffic is entering the mesh (ingressing) or leaving the mesh (egressing), application service traffic is directed first to the service proxy for handling prior to sending (or not sending) along to the application.  Traffic is transparently intercepted and redirected to the service proxy in order to reroute traffic from the service proxy to the service application. The service proxy intercepts and redirects traffic between the service proxy and service application places the service application’s container onto a network it would otherwise not be on. All traffic to and from the service application is seen by the service proxy.  Service proxies are the building blocks of service mesh data planes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Traffic Interception and Redirection:&lt;p&gt;The technology utilised to intercept and redirect traffic varies between service meshes. Some meshes allow you the option of using iptables, IPVS, or eBPF to transparently proxy requests between clients and service applications. Other service mesh proxies operate in a less transparent manner, requiring application traffic to be configured to direct their traffic to the proxy. The operating system type and kernel version used for the service mesh deployment are constrained by the choice of each of these technologies, which influences the speed with which packets are processed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Envoy is one of the most widely used proxy in service mesh data planes. It&amp;#x27;s also common to see it deployed as a load balancer or ingress gateway. The proxies used in service mesh data planes are highly intelligent.  In order to manipulate network packets (including application level data), they may include any number of protocol-specific filters . Extending data plane capabilities with technology advancements like WebAssembly allows service meshes to inject additional logic into requests while simultaneously handling large traffic loads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the number of proxies becomes unmanageable or when a single point of visibility and control is required, a service mesh control plane is essential. Control planes offer policy and configuration for the services in the mesh, transforming a set of isolated, stateless proxies into a service mesh. Control planes run out-of-band and do not directly touch any network packets in the mesh. Control planes usually include a command-line interface (CLI) and a user interface to interact with, both of which provide access to a centralised API for regulating proxy behaviour holistically. You can use the control plane&amp;#x27;s APIs to automate changes to its configuration (for example, using a continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline), where configuration is generally version controlled and updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Proxies are generally considered stateless, but this is a thought-provoking concept. In the way in which proxies are generally informed by the control plane of the presence of services, mesh topology updates, traffic and authorization policy, and so on, proxies cache the state of the mesh but aren’t regarded as the source of truth for the state of the mesh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can see how the data and control planes are packaged and deployed in Linkerd (pronounced &amp;quot;linker-dee&amp;quot;) and Istio (pronounced &amp;quot;Ist-tee-oh&amp;quot;), two prominent open source service meshes. In terms of packaging, Linkerdv1 contains both its proxying components (linkerd) and its control plane (namerd) packaged together simply as “Linkerd,” and Istio brings a collection of control plane components (Galley, Pilot, and Citadel) to pair by default with Envoy (a data plane) packaged together as “Istio.” Envoy is often labeled a service mesh, inappropriately so, because it takes packaging with a control plane to form a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh management plane is a higher order level of control as shown in Figure 4. A management plane may provide a variety of functions. As such, implementations vary in their functionality: some focusing on orchestrating service meshes (e.g., service mesh lifecycle management) and mesh federation, providing insight across a collection of diverse meshes. Some management planes focus on integrating service meshes with business process and policy, including governance, compliance, validation of configuration, and extensible access control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/figure4-b3eeda7dcac8dcf72d83a4cc33156ded.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Meshery&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figure 4: Meshery, the cloud native management plane’s architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A service mesh management plane is a higher order level of control. A management plane can provide various functions. As a result, implementations differ in functionality, with some focused on orchestrating service meshes (e.g., service mesh lifecycle management) and mesh federation, which provides insight across a set of meshes. Some management planes focus on integrating service meshes with business process and policy, including governance, compliance, validation of configuration, and extensible access control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of deployments, data planes, such as Linkerdv2, contain proxies that are created as part of the project and are not designed to be configured by hand, but rather to have their behaviour completely controlled by the control plane. Other service meshes, such as Istio, prefer not to develop their own proxy and instead ingest and utilise independent proxies (separate projects), simplifying proxy selection and deployment outside of the mesh(standalone). Control planes are often deployed in a separate &amp;quot;system&amp;quot; namespace, using Kubernetes as the example infrastructure. Depending on how closely they integrate with non-containerized workloads and a business&amp;#x27;s backend systems, management planes are deployed both on and off cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Network Planes]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

By the nature of their task, data planes must be highly efficient in the interception, introspection, and rewriting of network traffic. As a data plane component, Envoy is written in C++11 because it provides excellent performance (surprisingly, some say it provides a great developer experience). Rust has found its way into service meshes as a growing language (and something of a C++ competitor). Because of its properties around efficiency (outperforming Go) and memory safety (when written to be so) without garbage collection, Rust has been used for Linkerdv2’s data plane component, for the former nginMesh’s Mixer module (see “How to customize an Istio service mesh”), and is now being used in WebAssembly programs as data plane filters (see “Write WASM filters for Envoy in Rust and deploy with Consul”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
