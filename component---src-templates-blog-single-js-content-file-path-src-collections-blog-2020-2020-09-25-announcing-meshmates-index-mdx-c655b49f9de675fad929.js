Being fairly new\nto the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to\ndelve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm\nwelcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation\njobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the\ntask of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings\nhosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I\nfinally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!\nIt still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\nNext up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being\na new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and\nGraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to\nexpand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a\ncontinuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush\nTrivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have\nspent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the\nproject goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began\nhelping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to\ndo before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I\nrecently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a\nMeshMate, which I happily accepted.

Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I\nstumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of\nprojects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa\n(WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.\nA quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you\nsome much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I\nrecently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and\nmanaging construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my\nhands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous\ntech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too\nashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow\nmade it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another\ntask. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a\npeek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the\nonly one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was\nnot.\nI got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would\npreviously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different\napproach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was\namazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have\nhelped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an\ninvitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I\nhave been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly\nenvironment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may\nnot be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having\na supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing\ndetermined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!"),o.createElement("h4",null,o.createElement(i.Link,{className:"mute",to:"/community/members/ruth-ikegah"}," Ruth Ikegah ")),o.createElement("img",{src:s,className:"image-right",alt:"ruth-ikegah"}),o.createElement(t.p,null,"The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a\nclose-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.\nConsidering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only\n6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with.

I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.\nImpressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon\nbegan helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading.
