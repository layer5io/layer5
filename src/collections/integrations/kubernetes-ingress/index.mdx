<p>
An ingress controller is a Kubernetes resource that routes traffic from outside your cluster to services within the cluster.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
