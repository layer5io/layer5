<p>
AWS manages the software installation, upgrades, patching, scaling (up to 3 PB), and cross-region replication with no downtime. Amazon OpenSearch Service is also bundled with a dashboard visualization tool, OpenSearch Dashboards, which helps visualize not only log and trace data, but also machine-learning powered results for anomaly detection and search relevance ranking.
