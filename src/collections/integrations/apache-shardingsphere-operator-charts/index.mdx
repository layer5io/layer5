featureList: [
  "ShardingSphere provides a distributed database solution based on the underlying database, which can scale computing and storage horizontally.",
  "With a hybrid engine based on XA and BASE transactions, ShardingSphere provides distributed transaction capabilities on top of standalone databases, enabling data security across underlying data sources.",
  "ShardingSphere provides flexible read/write splitting capabilities and can achieve read access load balancing based on the understanding of SQL semantics and the ability to perceive the underlying database topology."

<p>
The ShardingSphere Kubernetes Operator automates provisioning, management, and operations of ShardingSphere Proxy clusters running on Kubernetes.
</p>
<p>Apache ShardingSphere is an ecosystem to transform any database into a distributed database system, and enhance it with sharding, elastic scaling, encryption features & more.</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
</p>
