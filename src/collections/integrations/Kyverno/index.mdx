Kubernetes Native Policy Management
<p>
    Meshery integrates with Kyverno along with policy engines designed for Kubernetes, like Open Policy Agent. With Kyverno, policies are managed as Kubernetes resources and no new language is required to write policies. This allows using familiar tools such as kubectl, git, and kustomize to manage policies. Meshery's GitOps-style management of Kyverno policies makes their review, validation, and approval simple.
