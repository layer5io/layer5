<p>
Clusterpedia is used for complex resources search across multiple clusters, support simultaneous search of a single kind of resource  or multiple kinds of resources existing in multiple clusters.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
