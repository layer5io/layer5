<p>
    Use the NATS server in Meshery Broker or bring your own NATS server to increase the resilience of your Meshery deployments. NATS self-heals and can scale up, down, or handle topology changes anytime with zero downtime to your system. Design, test, and manage configuration of all your cloud infrastructure and containerized applications as a visual topology. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.

    With the ability to process millions of messages a second per server, you’ll find unparalleled efficiency with NATS. Save money by minimizing cloud costs with reduced compute and network usage for streams, services, and eventing.
