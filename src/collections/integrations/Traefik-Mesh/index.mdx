    Deploy the Meshery Adapter for Traefik Mesh and enable fine-grained lifecycle and configuration management over your Traefik Mesh-enabled Kubernetes clusters. Using Traefik's golang-based plugins? Great. Ask about how Meshery manages WebAssembly-based plugins for service meshes with Envoy-based data planes. Design, test, and manage configuration of all your cloud infrastructure and containerized applications as a visual topology. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, MeshMap, create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.
