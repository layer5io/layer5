<p>
Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration platform, born on Kubernetes, with serverless superpowers.
</p>
<p>Apache Camel K is a lightweight integration framework built from Apache Camel that runs natively on Kubernetes and is specifically designed for serverless and microservice architectures.
Users of Camel K can instantly run integration code written in Camel DSL on their preferred cloud (Kubernetes or OpenShift).</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
</p>
<p>
    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices? Choose from thousands of pre-built components in Kanvas. Choose from hundreds of ready-made design patterns by importing templates from Meshery Catalog or use our low code designer, Kanvas, to create and deploy your own cloud native infrastructure designs.
