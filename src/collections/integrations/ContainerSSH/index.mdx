The user is transparently dropped in the container and the container is removed when the user disconnects. Authentication and container configuration are dynamic using webhooks, no system users required.</p><p>    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.</p><p>    Looking for best practice cloud native design and deployment best practices?
