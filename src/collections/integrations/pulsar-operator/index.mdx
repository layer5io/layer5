<p>
    The Pulsar Operator is a controller that manages Pulsar clusters in Kubernetes. It provides a full management life-cycle for Pulsar, including deployment, upgrades, scaling, and configuration changes. With the Pulsar Operator, Pulsar can run seamlessly in the Kubernetes clusters deployed on a public or private cloud. You can then manage Pulsar clusters using the Kubernetes Application Programming Interface (API) and the kubectl tool.
