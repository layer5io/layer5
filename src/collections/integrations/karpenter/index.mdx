howItWorks: "Using Meshery and Karpenter, once your Kubernetes cluster and the Karpenter controller are up and running"
howItWorksDetails: "Set up provisioners: By applying a provisioner to Karpenter, you can configure constraints on node provisioning and set timeout values for node expiry or Kubelet configuration values. 

Deploy workloads: When deploying workloads, you can request that scheduling constraints be met to direct which nodes Karpenter provisions for those workloads. "

    Karpenter is an open-source node provisioning project built for Kubernetes. Adding Karpenter to a Kubernetes cluster can dramatically improve the efficiency and cost of running workloads on that cluster.
