<p>
    The Ondat Operator installs and manages StorageOS within a cluster. Cluster nodes may contribute local or attached disk-based storage into a distributed pool, which is then available to all cluster members via a global namespace.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
