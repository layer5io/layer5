<p>
Knative is a developer-focused serverless application layer which is a great complement to the existing Kubernetes application constructs. Knative consists of two components: an HTTP-triggered autoscaling container runtime called “Knative Serving”, and a CloudEvents-over-HTTP asynchronous routing layer called “Knative Eventing”.

<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
