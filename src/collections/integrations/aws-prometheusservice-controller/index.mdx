<p>
Amazon Managed Service for Prometheus is a Prometheus-compatible service that monitors and provides alerts on containerized applications and infrastructure at scale. The service is integrated with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), and AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry.
</p>
<p>
    Collaboratively and visually diagram your cloud native infrastructure with GitOps-style pipeline integration. Design, test, and manage configuration your Kubernetes-based, containerized applications as a visual topology.
