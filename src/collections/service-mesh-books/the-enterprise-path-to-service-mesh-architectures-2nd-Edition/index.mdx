Planning to build a microservice-driven cloud native application or looking to modernize existing application services? Consider using a service mesh. A service mesh approach can help you create robust and scalable applications, but it also introduces new challenges. This updated report answers common questions regarding service mesh architectures through the lens of a large enterprise.
<span>Author <b>Lee Calcote</b>, founder and CEO of Layer5, shows developers, operators, architects, and IT leaders how to evaluate your organization’s readiness for using a service mesh—and provides a clear path to help you adopt one. You’ll evaluate several factors when deciding which applications should be built from the ground up and which can be converted with a new service mesh architecture.</span>

This updated edition discusses several service meshes available and the tools you need to implement them. You’ll explore:

<div>
  <li> Service mesh concepts, architecture, and components, such as control planes and data planes </li>
  <li> How a service mesh provides observability, resiliency, security, and traffic control of distributed application services</li>
  <li> Differences among service meshes and service mesh components from several vendors</li>
  <li>How service meshes compare to related technologies, including container orchestrators, API gateways, and client-side libraries</li>
  <li>Practical steps for service mesh adoption, deployment, customization, and integration</li>
  <li>The intelligence of the cloud native management plane and the power of the data plane</li>
