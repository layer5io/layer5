## How to Submit and Review Your Writing?

The Writing Program offers writers two convenient ways to get their writings reviewed by Community. Whether you prefer working with Google Docs or contributing directly to the website, we've got you covered. This structured guide will walk you through both options, ensuring that your valuable content is reviewed effectively.

1. **Google Docs Review:**

   If you prefer a straightforward approach, start by crafting your blog article within [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/), ensuring it's well-structured and error-free. Share the document with us by adding it to the [Community Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1o6ZSqCq1QUJmLIjl_Y0VgT_azNbgg1W2), we will provide feedback directly within the Google Doc. Engage in discussions to refine your content collaboratively. Once thoroughly reviewed, prepare your submission according to community guidelines.

2. **Website Contribution Review:**

   For those comfortable with local website development, contribute directly to the community website. [Set up your local environment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), create a blog post adhering to specified guidelines, and submit it via a Pull Request on [GitHub](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/). Reviewers will provide feedback, and you'll refine your post collaboratively. Upon completion, maintainers will merge your blog post into the website repository, celebrating your contribution.
