  <h2 id="communityGuidelines">Your Efforts Do Not Go Unnoticed or Unappreciated</h2>
</a>

As an open source-first community, we very much appreciate the engagement of individuals within the Layer5 community. We wouldn't be here without you. Our success is a collective one. Consequently, we are quite intentional about defining and encouraging the journey for each individual community member. No small part of their journey is that of recognizing their accomplishments and publicly celebrating their accolades. We do so in a number of ways.

<a id="Membership"><h3>Membership to the Github organizations</h3></a>

Membership to the Github organizations is a significant milestone for contributors who have shown persistent commitment and dedication to Layer5 projects. It is not solely about writing code but rather the consistency of engagement and alignment of mentality. Those who have been actively involved in the community for several months, making updates, helping others, attending meetings, and demonstrating a willingness to learn and share their knowledge, are the ones who are likely to receive an invite. Such individuals demonstrate a genuine desire to improve themselves, others, and the projects they are working on. Depending on the number of contributions made across the five GitHub organizations of Layer5, contributors can expect to receive an invitation to any or all of these organizations. We value and appreciate the hard work and dedication of our contributors, and we are delighted to reward their efforts with access to our Github organizations. Our <Link to="https://layer5.io/community/community-managers">Community Managers</Link> and <Link to="https://layer5.io/community/meshmates"> MeshMates</Link> recognize potential contributors on a weekly basis and typically invite individuals after 6 to 8 weeks of continuous, active participation.

<a id="Community_member_profile">
  <h3><Link to="/community/members">Community Member Profiles</Link></h3>
</a>

Once a contributor joins the Layer5 community by filling in the community member form, they are automatically classified as members of Layer5. Although, you earn a member profile after consistent contributions to the community for and projects. You can find out more about the Members profile on the Layer5 website.

Member profiles carry a number of specific designations, depending upon how a community member is participating. One of those designations is that of whether the member is actively particpating or has gone dormant. We define "active" and "inactive" members in the following way:

- **Active** - Members who are engaged and participating in any aspect of the community and/or its projects. Activities vary broadly from meeting attendance to helping other contributors to using and providing feedback on projects, to code contribution, and so on.
- **Inactive**  - Members who have previously engaged but have not participated in the community or projects within ~two months.

<a id="Badges"><h3 style={recognitionsstyle}>Community Member Profile Badges</h3></a>

Badges are awarded to community members who have been consistently engaged and impactful within a given area of the community or on a specific project. Every community member, whether contributing with code or not, has the opportunity to obtain any number of badges of recognition of their efforts. Community members are encouraged to collect the whole set!
