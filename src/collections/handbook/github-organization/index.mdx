<a id="top"><h2>GitHub Organization Membership</h2></a>

Membership to the GitHub organizations is a significant milestone for contributors who have shown persistent commitment and dedication to Layer5 projects. It is not solely about writing code but rather the consistency of engagement and alignment of mentality.

<a id="Requirements"><h4><strong>Membership Requirements</strong></h4></a>

<p>
Contributors who may be invited typically:
<ul>
<li>Have been actively involved in the community for several weeks</li>
<li>Make regular updates to projects</li>
<li>Help other community members</li>
<li>Attend development meetings</li>
<li>Demonstrate a willingness to learn and share knowledge</li>
<li>Show a genuine desire to improve themselves, others, and the projects</li>
</ul></p>


<a id="InvitationProcess"><h4><strong>Invitation Process</strong></h4></a>

Depending on the number and quality of contributions made across the five GitHub organizations of Layer5, contributors can receive an invitation to any or all of these orgs. The process involves:
   1. Sending a group DM
2. Executing Slack slash command in #community-management <p/>

<a id="TemplateMessage"><h4><strong>Group Message for Invitations</strong></h4></a>

When you identify a worthy contributor, send a message in a group DM that includes the individual and other maintainers/appropriate members: look in Community Managers' docs to see some examples.

<a id="SendingInvitation"><h4><strong>Sending the GitHub Invitation</strong></h4></a>

To send the invitation to join the GitHub organization, use the following slash command in #community-management channel:

<div className="code-block">
  <code>/invite-github [email address] [organization name]</code>
</div>

Where **[organization name]** should be either:
- **layer5io** - to send the invite to the email address to join Layer5 GitHub org under the "layer5-contributors" team
- **meshery** - to send the invite to the email address to join Meshery GitHub organization under the "contributors" team

For example:
<div className="code-block">
  <code>/invite-github contributor@example.com layer5io</code>
</div>
