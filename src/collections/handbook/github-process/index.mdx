<h2>Issue and PR Labels and Templates, Bots</h2><br/>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3><br />

The Layer5 GitHub Process emphasizes consistent pull requests and issue labels to streamline continuous integration and reduce overhead across the growing repository collection.

The number of repositories under the "Layer5io" organization is growing. In order to ensure consistency across the repositories and to decrease the time it takes for a continuous integration (GitHub Actions) to execute, consistent use of pull request and issue labels will aid in the reduction of overhead.

### Issue and Pull Request Templates
Layer5 uses issue and pull request templates. See the `.github` folder in any repo for examples.

### Template Repositories
Layer5 uses the following repository templates:
- layer5-repo-template
- meshery-adapter-template

### Branch Protection
Layer5 protects the **master** branch by requiring reviews from at least one approver.

### Organization Secrets
Layer5 has the following org-wide secrets available:

## Layer5 Issue Labels Guide

Well-chosen issue labels keep our repositories organized, make contributing easier, and help everyone—from maintainers to first-time contributors—find relevant tasks quickly. Below, we explain each major label category and when to use them.

### Area Labels
Area labels specify which part of the project an issue or PR relates to—such as documentation, user interface, or continuous integration. Using area labels helps contributors with specific interests or expertise find and filter issues that are relevant to them, and helps project maintainers prioritize or assign tasks more efficiently. Assign an area label any time you create or triage an issue/PR that falls within a specific domain (docs, UI, CI, performance, etc.).

<div className="table-container">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Label</th><th>Description</th><th>Color</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>area/ci</td><td>Continuous integration, build & release</td><td>#5319e1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/docs</td><td>Improvements/additions to documentation</td><td>#5319e2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/lifecycle</td><td>Lifecycle management (install, uninstall, configure)</td><td>#5319e3</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/performance</td><td>Performance management</td><td>#5319e4</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/tests</td><td>Testing / quality assurance</td><td>#5319e5</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/ui</td><td>User interface</td><td>#5319e6</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/workloads</td><td>Applications / services</td><td>#5319e7</td></tr>
      <tr><td>area/helm</td><td>Helm charts issues</td><td>#5319e8</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

### Component Labels
Component labels indicate which software module or subsystem is affected by an issue. This ensures issues are routed to the right maintainers and allows more detailed filtering beyond the broader area labels. Attach a component label when your issue/PR impacts a specific module (e.g., a CLI tool, API, or pattern engine).

### Programming Language Labels
Programming language labels highlight the primary language used in the issue or PR. This helps contributors looking for language-specific work, and aids in code review or help requests. Use a programming language label if the change, bug, or feature is specific to a particular language (e.g., a Go backend bug, a JavaScript UI enhancement).

### PR (Pull Request) Labels
PR labels manage the state or special requirements of a pull request, like indicating it's a draft, dependent on others, or not yet ready for merging. Apply a PR label if your pull request isn't ready, should not be merged, updates dependencies, or is on hold.

### Issue Process & Status Labels
These labels show the current status of an issue—such as blocked, duplicate, in need of a design, or if an action (like an invitation) should be triggered. Some are used by bots to automate reminders or mark stale issues. Apply these when the situation applies (e.g. "blocked" if work can't proceed, "design required" if more planning is needed).

### Kind Labels
Kind labels classify the general type of change or discussion: bug, feature, chore, enhancement, epic, question, or proposal. This improves searchability and helps teams organize their workflows. Use the kind label that best describes your issue or PR.

### Priority Labels
Priority labels help teams triage and allocate attention, making it clear which issues are urgent and which can wait. Always apply a priority label, adjusting as priorities shift or as issues are escalated or downgraded.

### Service Mesh Labels
Service mesh labels point out which mesh technology or ecosystem the issue pertains to. This is vital for projects supporting multiple meshes, enabling modular attention and expertise. Use these when your change or report is specific to one mesh (like Istio or Linkerd).

### Help & Onboarding Labels
Help labels signal issues where some support is needed, or which are especially suitable for newcomers. These labels foster open source engagement and make onboarding easier for new contributors. Apply these to issues where you'd appreciate community help (`help wanted`) or for issues that are clearly documented, small in scope, and ideal for first-timers (`good first issue`).

### Best Practices & Example
- **Apply all relevant labels**: an issue may belong to an area, a component, a kind, have a priority, AND be language-specific.
- **Update labels as issues evolve**: don't hesitate to add or remove as information changes.
- **When in doubt, ask!**: The <a href="https://layer5.io/community">Layer5 community Slack</a> is a welcoming place.

**Example:**<br />
If you find a documentation error regarding Meshery's CLI, that's an easy fix, you might use these labels:<br/>
`area/docs, component/mesheryctl, kind/bug, priority/low, good first issue`

### Questions or Suggestions?
Labels missing? Unclear usage? Open a discussion or tag a maintainer in your issue, or bring it up in <a href="https://layer5.io/community">community Slack</a>.
