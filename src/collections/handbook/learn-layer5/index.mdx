## Sharing what you've learned at a technical event

At Layer5, we participate in many different technical conferences, in international events, in online workshops, at meetups, and so on. Our engagement in these events ranges across various cloud native and open source topics and varies between speaking, hosting workshops, managing project booths, and so on. Our engagement in these events, increases awareness about our projects and the individual community members that contribute to the projects.
