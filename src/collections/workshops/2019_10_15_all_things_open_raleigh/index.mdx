<h4>Using Service Meshes Workshop - All Things Open 2019, Raleigh, NC</h4>
<p>
  As the third phase in your microservices journey, service meshes provide a
  substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility and granular control over
  service requests. Service meshes have quickly entered the cloud native
  landscape filling unmet service-level needs. Organizations that have adopted
  containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools
  to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5,
  service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a
  series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the
  popular service mesh - Istio. During this workshop you will gain hands-on
  experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running
  in Kubernetes.
