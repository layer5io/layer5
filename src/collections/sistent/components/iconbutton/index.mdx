  <h2>Types</h2>

IconButtons come in different visual styles to establish hierarchy and meet various interface needs.

<h3>Standard</h3>

Standard IconButtons provide a subtle interactive area around the icon with hover and focus states. They're ideal for secondary actions that don't need strong visual emphasis.

      <IconButtonDemo type="basic" />

<h3>With Background Color</h3>

IconButtons can be styled with background colors to create more prominent interactive elements while maintaining the compact icon-only interface.

      <IconButtonDemo type="background" />
    </ThemeWrapper>

IconButtons support multiple sizes to accommodate different contexts and touch target requirements.

*   **Small:** (32px) ideal for dense interfaces and secondary actions.
*   **Medium:** (40px) standard size, balancing compactness and accessibility.
*   **Large:** (48px) ideal for primary actions and mobile interfaces.

IconButtons work seamlessly with various icon libraries and custom icons. They support React Icons, Material-UI icons, and custom SVG icons.

<h3>Using Sistent Icons</h3>

IconButtons work perfectly with Sistent's built-in icon library, maintaining design consistency across your application.

<a id="Accessibility">
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
</a>

IconButtons include built-in accessibility features but require proper implementation to ensure they're usable by all users.

<h3>Essential Properties</h3>

*   **aria-label:** Always provide descriptive labels for screen readers
*   **Keyboard navigation:** IconButtons are fully keyboard accessible by default
*   **Focus indicators:** Clear visual focus states for keyboard users
*   **Touch targets:** Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile accessibility

**Best Practice:** When using IconButtons, always include meaningful aria-labels or aria-labelledby attributes to describe the action to assistive technologies.
