<h2>Avatar Group</h2>

The <strong>AvatarGroup</strong> component displays a compact collection of avatar elements that represent a group of users or entities. It’s useful in collaborative spaces, team-based features, or user listings.

<h3>Design Guidelines and Best Practices</h3>

When implementing `AvatarGroup`, it's important to consider how it enhances collaboration and identity clarity without overwhelming the interface. Here are key best practices:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Use to represent teams or shared ownership:</strong> Ideal for showing members of a project, contributors, or shared access groups in apps like dashboards or chat.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Don’t overuse in dense interfaces:</strong> Too many avatars in a group can clutter the view. Use the `max` prop to collapse overflow into a `+N` indicator.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Use consistent sizing and spacing:</strong> Align all avatars to the same size to maintain visual harmony. Use `spacing` options (or `sx`) for controlled overlap.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Provide accessible <code>alt</code> text:</strong> Each avatar should have meaningful alternative text for screen readers. Avoid empty or redundant `alt` values.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Avoid interactive behavior within AvatarGroup:</strong> The component is for display only. If avatars must be clickable, wrap each `&lt;Avatar&gt;` individually in buttons or links outside the group context.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Keep it compact:</strong> AvatarGroup is not meant for long lists. For large user sets, link to a full view or show summary avatars only.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Fallbacks matter:</strong> Always account for broken images by using initials or icons as fallback content within each `Avatar`.
  </li>
</ul>

This ensures that `AvatarGroup` remains a helpful, visually tidy, and accessible interface element wherever user identity grouping is necessary.
