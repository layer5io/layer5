The `ToggleButton` and `ToggleButtonGroup` are versatile components that can be used for a wide range of applications. Their intuitive design ensures users can make selections easily and confidently. Whether it's enabling a setting, selecting a mode, or choosing multiple options, these components are built to enhance user experience across different scenarios.

The `ToggleButton` and `ToggleButtonGroup` components provide an efficient way to handle user interactions for toggling states or selecting one or multiple options. Below are some common use cases.

<h3>Exclusive Selection</h3>

Use an exclusive `ToggleButtonGroup` when only one selection is allowed at a time. This is useful for scenarios like aligning text to the left, center, or right.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <ToggleButtonDemo type="exclusive" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Multiple Selection</h3>

Enable multiple selections within a `ToggleButtonGroup` for cases where users need to toggle multiple options, such as enabling bold, italic, and underline text styling simultaneously.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <ToggleButtonDemo type="basic" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Sizes</h3>

Adjust the size of the `ToggleButton` using the `size` prop. This property supports `small`, `medium`, and `large` values to suit various design requirements.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <ToggleButtonDemo type="sizes" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Colors</h3>

Use the `color` prop to style the `ToggleButtonGroup` with pre-defined theme colors, such as `primary` or `secondary`. This ensures consistency across the application.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <ToggleButtonDemo type="colors" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Vertical Orientation</h3>

The `orientation` prop allows you to arrange toggle buttons vertically instead of horizontally. This is ideal for menus or options requiring more vertical space.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <ToggleButtonDemo type="vertical" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>
