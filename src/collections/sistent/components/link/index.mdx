Links can be paired with other elements to create cohesive designs, enhancing the digital experience by providing smooth transitions and interaction cues.

  <h2>Types of Links</h2>
</a>

Links in an interface serve as vital elements for navigation and interaction. Multiple types of links are available to establish hierarchy, provide visual prominence, and enhance flexibility, guiding users towards their goals efficiently. With distinct styling and behaviors, links can help streamline user flows and create a cohesive user experience.

<h3>Simple Links</h3>

Basic anchor links with customizable colors and typography styles that inherit properties from the Typography component. This allows flexibility in styling with options like various text sizes or variants.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <Link
      href="#"
      style={{
        marginLeft: "10px",
        padding: "6px",
      }}
    >
      Simple Link
    </Link>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h3>Customized Links</h3>

The links can be customized in the below mentioned way

<h4>1. Color</h4>

Normally the color of Sistent Link is green. You can customize link colors with predefined values such as primary, secondary, error, success, warning, info, or inherit existing text colors.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <Link
      href="#"
      style={{
        marginLeft: "10px",
        textDecoration: "none",
        color: "blue",
        padding: "6px",
      }}
    >
      Customized Link 1
    </Link>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h4>2. Underlining</h4>

Also known as ghost buttons, text buttons are mostly just what the name implies; they are buttons without fills or borders which might just have a specific text styling and color to denote different states for easier identification.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <Link
      href="#"
      style={{
        marginLeft: "10px",
        textDecoration: "underline",
        padding: "6px",
      }}
    >
      Customized Link 2
    </Link>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h4>3. Variants</h4>

Links can have various text styles using the different styling property.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <Link
      href="#"
      style={{
        marginLeft: "10px",
        textDecoration: "underline",
        color: "blue",
        padding: "6px",
        border: "2px solid green",
      }}
      variant="body1"
    >
      Customized Link 3
    </Link>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<a id="Security">
  <h2>Security</h2>
</a>

When using `target="_blank"` with links, it's crucial to include `rel="noopener"` or `rel="noreferrer"` for security reasons:

- **Prevent Access:** `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from accessing the `window.opener` property, securing your original page from potential malicious redirects.
- **Avoid Referer Leakage:** `rel="noreferrer"` not only blocks the new page's access to your original page but also stops the Referer header from being sent, protecting user privacy.
- **Security Risk Mitigation:** Using these attributes reduces the risk of phishing attacks and ensures that your site maintains control over its navigation and data.

By following these practices, you can enhance the security of your web application and protect your users.

<a id="Optimization">
  <h2>Optimized Rendering of Links</h2>
</a>

`useMemo` is a React hook that helps optimize the rendering of link components by memorizing computed values, which prevents unnecessary re-renders.
