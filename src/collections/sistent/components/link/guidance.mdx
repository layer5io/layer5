A link component is a navigational element that directs users to another page or section within an application.

Links are fundamental components in web navigation, allowing users to move between different pages or resources. Their design and implementation are crucial for creating a seamless browsing experience.

Links have many functions:

<h3>Navigation Links</h3>

These links help users navigate through a website, directing them to important sections or related content. They should be easily accessible and clearly labeled to enhance usability.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <Link
      href="#"
      style={{
        marginLeft: "10px",
        textDecoration: "none",
        color: "green",
        padding: "6px",
      }}
    >
      Navigate to Layer 5
    </Link>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h3>Call to Action (CTA) Links</h3>

CTA links encourage users to take specific actions, such as signing up for a newsletter or downloading a resource. They should stand out visually to attract user attention and drive engagement.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <StyledButton
      $primary
      $url=""
      className="button"
      $external={false}
    >
      <Link
        href="#"
        style={{
          marginLeft: "10px",
          textDecoration: "none",
          padding: "6px",
          color: "white"
        }}
      >
        Get Started
      </Link>
    </StyledButton>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h3>External Links</h3>

These links direct users to external websites. It’s important to provide clear indicators (like icons or different styles) that these links lead to external content, which helps users manage their navigation expectations.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <Link
      href="#"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      style={{
        marginLeft: "10px",
        textDecoration: "none",
        padding: "6px",
        cursor: "pointer",
        display: "inline-flex",
        alignItems: "center",
      }}
    >
      Visit External Resource <ExternalLinkIcon />
    </Link>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<a id="Labeling">
  <h2>Labeling</h2>
</a>

Link labels are vital for communicating the action associated with the link. Labels should be concise, informative, and use action-oriented language (e.g., "Download Report," "Learn More") to guide users effectively.

<h3>Case Style</h3>

Consistency in the case style of link text improves readability and enhances the overall aesthetic of the website. Using a uniform style, such as sentence case or title case, contributes to a more professional appearance.

<h3>Font Weight</h3>

The weight of the font in link text can signify importance and attract user attention. A bolder font can indicate a primary action, while a lighter font may denote secondary options. Legibility is essential for ensuring that links are easy to read.

<h3>Text Decoration</h3>

Links typically use underlines to distinguish them from regular text. However, it’s important to maintain the underline for accessibility and usability, as users often associate underlined text with clickable links. Consider hover effects to provide visual feedback.
