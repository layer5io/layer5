Dialog components provide modal windows that focus user attention on specific tasks or information. They overlay the main content and require user interaction before returning to the underlying interface.

Below is a simple example of how to use the Dialog component.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
      <DialogDemo />
    </div>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

The component can be used in several main variants:

- **Standard:** Basic modal dialog for confirmations and simple interactions
- **Form:** Dialog containing input fields for data collection
- **Full-screen:** Expanded dialog for complex forms or mobile interfaces
