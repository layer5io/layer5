<h3>Step Design</h3>
- Keep step labels short and descriptive (1-3 words)
- Use meaningful icons that relate to step content
- Limit to 3-7 steps maximum for better usability
- Group related tasks into single steps

<h3>Navigation</h3>
- Always provide a "Back" button (except on first step)
- Disable "Next" until current step is valid
- Use clear action labels: "Continue", "Next", "Finish"
- Show progress indicator (current step / total steps)

<h3>User Experience</h3>
- Validate input before allowing progression
- Save progress automatically when possible
- Provide clear error messages with solutions
- Allow users to edit previous steps
- Show completion status for each step
