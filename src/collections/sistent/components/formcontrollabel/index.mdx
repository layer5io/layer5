The `FormControlLabel` component is commonly used to attach readable text labels to controls like checkboxes, radio buttons, or switches. It helps ensure the control is understandable, accessible, and easy to interact with.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <FormControlLabelDemo type="mixed" />
    </ThemeWrapper>

Labels are automatically associated with their controls, making it easier for assistive technologies to provide context. Clicking on the label will also toggle the control.
