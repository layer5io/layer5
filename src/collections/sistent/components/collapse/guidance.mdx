The Collapse component allows you to create collapsible content areas that can be toggled to show or hide content. It's commonly used for FAQs, accordions, and other UI elements where space needs to be managed efficiently.

The Collapse component provides a smooth, animated transition for showing and hiding content. It's an essential UI pattern for managing content density and progressive disclosure of information.

<a id="Best Practices">
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clear Triggers:</strong> Always use clear, descriptive labels for collapse triggers that indicate the action and content.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Progressive Disclosure:</strong> Use collapse to hide secondary content or advanced options that aren't immediately needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance:</strong> For large content, consider using <code>unmountOnExit</code> to improve performance by unmounting content when collapsed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Animation Timing:</strong> Adjust the <code>timeout</code> prop to match your application's animation speed for a cohesive feel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Consistent Behavior:</strong> Maintain consistent behavior across your application - don't mix different animation patterns for similar interactions.
  </li>
</ul>

<a id="Accessibility Considerations">
  <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Ensure the collapse trigger is keyboard accessible and can be activated with both Enter and Space keys.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>ARIA Attributes:</strong> The component automatically handles <code>aria-expanded</code> and <code>aria-controls</code> attributes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Focus Management:</strong> Consider managing focus when content is expanded/collapsed, especially for screen reader users.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Screen Reader Announcements:</strong> Use <code>aria-live</code> regions to announce state changes to screen reader users.
  </li>
</ul>

<a id="When to Use">
  <h2>When to Use</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>FAQs and help sections</li>
  <li>Forms with optional or advanced fields</li>
  <li>Content that can be toggled on/off</li>
  <li>Accordion interfaces</li>
  <li>Mobile navigation menus</li>
</ul>

<a id="When to Consider Something Else">
  <h2>When to Consider Something Else</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>For simple show/hide without animation, consider conditional rendering</li>
  <li>For modal dialogs or overlays, use the Dialog component instead</li>
  <li>For tabbed interfaces, consider using the Tabs component</li>
</ul>

<a id="Performance Optimization">
  <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  <li>Use <code>unmountOnExit</code> for better performance with large content</li>
  <li>Consider code-splitting for complex content within collapsible sections</li>
  <li>Memoize the content if it includes expensive computations</li>
</ul>

<a id="Common Patterns">
  <h2>Common Patterns</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accordion:</strong> Multiple collapsible sections where only one can be open at a time</li>
  <li><strong>Expandable Cards:</strong> Cards with a summary that can be expanded for more details</li>
  <li><strong>Progressive Disclosure:</strong> Show advanced options or additional information on demand</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Navigation:</strong> Collapsible menus for mobile views</li>
</ul>
