  <h2>Usage</h2>
</a>

Accordions are useful when you want to toggle between hiding and showing large amounts of content. They help reduce vertical space and improve the user experience by organizing content in a hierarchical, easy-to-scan way.

<ul>
  <li>Use accordions to organize related information into sections</li>
  <li>Allow users to focus on one section at a time</li>
  <li>Reduce scrolling by collapsing content that's not immediately needed</li>
  <li>Provide clear, descriptive headers for each accordion panel</li>
</ul>

<a id="Basic Example">
  <h3>Basic Example</h3>

        <AccordionSummary
          expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}
          aria-controls="usage-panel1-content"
          id="usage-panel1-header"

<a id="When to Use">
  <h2>When to Use</h2>
</a>

Accordions are best used when you need to present multiple sections of content in a limited space. Here are some common use cases:

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h3>

Accordions are ideal for FAQ sections where users can expand only the questions they're interested in, making it easier to scan and find relevant information.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <div style={{ width: "100%" }}>
      <Accordion>
        <AccordionSummary expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
          <Typography>How do I get started with Layer5?</Typography>
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
            Visit the Layer5 community page, join our Slack, and explore the getting started guides for each project.
          </Typography>
        </AccordionDetails>
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion>
        <AccordionSummary expandIcon={<ExpandMoreIcon />}>
          <Typography>Is Layer5 open source?</Typography>
        </AccordionSummary>
        <AccordionDetails>
          <Typography>
            Yes, all Layer5 projects are open source and welcome contributions from the community.
          </Typography>
        </AccordionDetails>
      </Accordion>
    </div>
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h3>Settings and Configuration Panels</h3>

Use accordions to organize different categories of settings, allowing users to focus on one category at a time.

<Row className="image-container">
  <ThemeWrapper>
    <ControlledAccordion />
  </ThemeWrapper>
</Row>

<h3>Documentation and Help Sections</h3>

Organize documentation into collapsible sections to help users navigate through large amounts of information efficiently.

<a id="Best Practices">
  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
</a>

Follow these guidelines to ensure accordions are effective and user-friendly:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Clear Headers:</strong> Use descriptive, concise headers that clearly indicate the content within each panel. Users should be able to understand what information they'll find before expanding.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Logical Grouping:</strong> Group related content together and order panels in a logical sequence (alphabetical, chronological, or by importance).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Visual Indicators:</strong> Always use clear expand/collapse icons (like arrows) to indicate the current state and interactivity of each panel.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Controlled vs Uncontrolled:</strong> Decide whether multiple panels can be open simultaneously (uncontrolled) or only one at a time (controlled) based on your use case.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Accessible:</strong> Ensure accordions are keyboard accessible and work with screen readers. Use proper ARIA attributes for accessibility.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Performance:</strong> Avoid nesting too many accordions or placing heavy content inside panels that could slow down the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Mobile-Friendly:</strong> Accordions work particularly well on mobile devices where screen space is limited. Ensure touch targets are large enough.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Default State:</strong> Consider which panels (if any) should be expanded by default based on the most commonly accessed information.
  </li>
</ul>
