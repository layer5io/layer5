  <h2>Function</h2>

The RadioGroup component helps achieve the following functions:

- **Single Selection:** Ensures that only one option can be selected at a time, making it ideal for mutually exclusive choices.
- **Form Inputs:** Commonly used in forms where users need to select from predefined options, such as survey questions or settings.
- **Custom UI Controls:** Can be styled and customized to fit different design requirements and themes.

  <h2>Best Practices</h2>
</a>

- **Single-choice only:** Use RadioGroup when users must select just one option from a set. For multiple selections, use checkboxes instead.
- **Clear labeling:** Provide short, descriptive labels for each radio option to help users understand their choices quickly.
- **Logical grouping:** Visually and semantically group related radio options together to improve clarity and accessibility.
- **Default selection:** Set a sensible default value to guide users and streamline their decision-making process.
- **Horizontal layout:** Use the `row` prop for horizontal alignment when space is limited or when options are closely related.
