Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. They communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important information.

<h3>Clarity and Recognition</h3>

Use icons that are universally recognized or easily understood within your target audience. Avoid using obscure or overly abstract symbols that may confuse users.

<h3>Consistency</h3>

Maintain visual consistency across all icons in your interface. Icons should share similar visual weight, style, and proportions to create a cohesive design system.

<h3>Size and Spacing</h3>

Ensure icons are sized appropriately for their context and maintain adequate spacing from surrounding elements. Icons should be large enough to be easily tapped or clicked, especially on touch devices (minimum 24x24px for touch targets).

<h3>Color and Contrast</h3>

Use colors that provide sufficient contrast with the background for accessibility. Consider how icons appear in both light and dark themes, and ensure they remain visible and recognizable in all contexts.

<h3>Labels and Tooltips</h3>

When icons might be ambiguous, always provide text labels or tooltips. This is especially important for critical actions or less common functions. Labels help users understand functionality without having to guess.

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

Ensure icons are accessible to all users, including those using screen readers. Provide appropriate aria-labels and alt text where needed. Never rely solely on color to convey meaning.

<h3>When to Use Icons</h3>

Icons work best when they enhance understanding rather than obscure it. Use icons when they add visual interest, save space, or make interfaces more scannable. Avoid using icons just for decoration if they don't serve a functional purpose.

<h3>Icon Placement</h3>

Position icons where users expect to find them. Common placements include navigation menus, buttons, form fields, and action bars. Ensure icons are aligned properly with accompanying text or other elements.

<h3>Combining Icons with Text</h3>

When combining icons with text, ensure proper spacing and alignment. Icons typically work well when placed to the left of text labels in left-to-right languages. For buttons, icons can appear on either side of the label depending on the action.
