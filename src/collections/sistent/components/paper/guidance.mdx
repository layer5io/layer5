The Paper component provides an elevated surface for displaying content. It mimics the behavior of real-world surfaces with shadow effects, supporting Material Design's elevation system.

<a id="Usage Guidelines">
  <h2>Usage Guidelines</h2>
</a>

When using the Paper component, follow these guidelines to ensure consistency and usability across your designs.

<a id="Elevation Guidelines">
  <h3>Elevation Guidelines</h3>
</a>

- Use lower elevations (0-3) for subtle surfaces such as cards and small sections.
- Higher elevations (8-24) are best for modals or key areas that need emphasis.
- Be mindful of the dark mode behavior, where higher elevations result in a lighter background.

<a id="Variant Guidelines">
  <h3>Variant Guidelines</h3>
</a>

- Use the `outlined` variant for areas where shadows might feel visually overwhelming.
- Stick to the default elevation variant for core components requiring shadow depth.

<a id="Corners Guidelines">
  <h3>Corners Guidelines</h3>
</a>

- Rounded corners are more user-friendly and should be preferred unless a strict design requires square corners.
- Use square corners sparingly, mostly for components meant to indicate precision or alignment with grid systems.

<a id="Accessibility">
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
</a>

- Make sure elevated surfaces have sufficient contrast with the background.
- Use clear and concise labels or headings for content within Paper components to enhance accessibility.
