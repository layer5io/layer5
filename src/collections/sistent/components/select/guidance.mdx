title: Select Guidance
component: select
description: The Select component is a versatile and customizable element commonly used in forms and user interfaces. It is designed to present a list of options for users to choose from, either as a single selection or multiple selections. This component plays a vital role in collecting user-provided information efficiently and intuitively.

import { FormControl, InputLabel, MenuItem, Select } from "@mui/material";
import SelectDemo from "./SelectDemo";

The select component can exhibit different state based on the context and user input. Since it is usually used within a form component, these states can act in response to the user input for other components in the form.

<h3>Disabled</h3>
If the component is disabled, the dropdown menu won't display when user clicks on the selection area. This behavior is useful when the user is not allowed to select any option.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SelectDemo type="basic" disabled />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Error</h3>
This behavior is used to indicate that the user has made an error or the selection is not compatible with other form components.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SelectDemo type="basic" error />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Required</h3>
If specified, the select component will be required to have an input from the user. An asterisk will be displayed next to the label to let the user know that the input is required.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SelectDemo type="basic" required />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<a id="Customization">
  <h2>Customization</h2>
</a>

Additional props can be added to the select component to customize its label and dropdown menu to provide use with more context of their selection.

<h3>Label and helper text</h3>
The label is optional. If provided, helper text is displayed below the component to give the user more context about the component.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SelectDemo type="helper" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Placeholder</h3>
A placeholder is a short hint or description that is displayed inside an input field or select component before the user enters a value.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SelectDemo type="placeholder" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<h3>Grouping</h3>
If the selection options are organized into groups, their groups can be displayed within the dropdown menu.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SelectDemo type="grouping" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

<a id="Multiple select">
  <h2>Multiple select</h2>
</a>

The multiple select component allows users to select more than one option from the dropdown list.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">

      <SelectDemo type="multiple" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
