Lists are essential UI elements that allow items to be organized sequentially in a structured and readable way. They help users view, select, and interact with multiple items conveniently.

Lists can be used for various purposes, including displaying items, navigational menus, or highlighting features. The List component provides a flexible container for organizing related items in a vertical layout. It can be customized to display items with icons, buttons, avatars, and other interactive elements. This component is essential for organizing content in a structured, accessible format.

<a id="Purpose & Context">
  <h3>1. Purpose & Context</h3>
</a>

- Clearly define the purpose of the List (e.g., data grouping, navigation, task management).
- Use Lists where a vertical layout enhances user understanding or accessibility.

<a id="Spacing & Alignment">
  <h3>2. Spacing & Alignment</h3>
</a>

- Maintain consistent vertical spacing between items.
- Align text, icons, and avatars for a clean, organized appearance.
- Consistent spacing and alignment ensure list items are visually pleasing and easy to scan. Items should be aligned to the left, with adequate padding between elements.

<a id="Interactive Design">
  <h3>3. Interactive Design</h3>
</a>

- For interactive Lists, use actionable items like `ListItemButton` and ensure buttons or links have proper visual cues (hover/focus states).
- Add affordances like icons or colors to signify item state (e.g., completed, active, or disabled).

<a id="Accessibility">
  <h3>4. Accessibility</h3>
</a>

- Label all List Items using `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attributes for screen readers.
- Ensure all interactive elements within a List are keyboard-navigable and have clear focus indicators.

<a id="Component-Specific Guidance">
  <h2>Component-Specific Guidance</h2>
</a>

<a id="Lists">
  <h3>1. List</h3>
</a>

- Use the List component as a wrapper for items, ensuring adequate padding and structure.
- Keep Lists concise; avoid excessive scrolling by grouping items with `ListSubheader`.

<a id="List Item">
  <h3>2. List Item</h3>
</a>

- Limit content to 1-2 lines of text for readability.
- Use secondary text sparingly to avoid visual clutter.

<a id="List Item Button">
  <h3>3. List Item Button</h3>
</a>

- Ensure actionable buttons have a clear purpose, communicated via labels or icons.
- Avoid excessive buttons in a single List to prevent overwhelming users.

<a id="List Item Icon">
  <h3>4. List Item Icon</h3>
</a>

- Icons should be meaningful and contextually relevant (e.g., `CheckIcon` for completed tasks, `NotificationsIcon` for notifications).
- Align and size icons appropriately relative to the text.

<a id="List Item Avatar">
  <h3>5. List Item Avatar</h3>
</a>

- Use avatars to represent users or entities visually.
- Provide accessible alternatives (e.g., initials or placeholders) when images are unavailable.

<a id="List Item Text">
  <h3>6. List Item Text</h3>
</a>

- Maintain a clear hierarchy between `primaryText` (main content) and `secondaryText` (supporting details).
- Ensure text is legible and does not dominate the layout.

<a id="List Subheader">
  <h3>7. List Subheader</h3>
</a>

- Subheaders should describe the group of items succinctly.
- Avoid excessive nesting of subheaders to prevent user confusion.
