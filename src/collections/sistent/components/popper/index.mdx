description: The Popper component provides a mechanism for positioning content dynamically relative to a reference element. It is commonly used for tooltips, dropdowns, and modals, enhancing the user experience by presenting contextual information without overcrowding the interface.

import { Popper, Button, Box } from "@sistent/sistent";
import PopperDemo from "./PopperDemo";

Poppers are critical for displaying information dynamically and can be used in various scenarios like tooltips, dropdowns, and menus. By anchoring the content to a reference element, Poppers provide users with relevant information as they interact with the interface.

<a id="Basic Example">
  <h2>Basic Example</h2>
</a>

Below is a simple example of how to use the Popper component to display content relative to a button.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <PopperDemo type="basic" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

The `anchorEl` prop specifies the element to which the Popper will be anchored. The `open` prop controls its visibility.

<a id="Styling and Positioning">
  <h2>Styling and Positioning</h2>
</a>

You can customize the positioning of the Popper using the `placement` prop to define where the Popper appears relative to the anchor element.

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <PopperDemo type="positioned" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

The above example demonstrates a Popper positioned relative to the reference button, providing flexibility in its placement.
