The Popper component provides a mechanism for positioning content dynamically relative to a reference element. It is commonly used for tooltips, dropdowns, and modals, enhancing the user experience by presenting contextual information without overcrowding the interface.

Proper usage of the Popper component can greatly enhance user experience by providing relevant contextual information at the right time. Below are some guidelines to ensure effective implementation.

<a id="Positioning">
  <h2>Positioning</h2>
</a>

The positioning of the Popper is critical for usability. Use the `placement` prop to control where the Popper appears relative to its anchor element. Options include:

- top
- bottom
- left
- right
- top-start
- top-end
- bottom-start
- bottom-end
- left-start
- left-end
- right-start
- right-end

Choosing the right position helps to prevent overlap with other interface elements and improves readability.

<a id="Styling">
  <h2>Styling</h2>
</a>

The Popper component inherits styles from the Sistent theme. You can customize the appearance by applying styles to the content inside the Popper. For instance:

<div className="showcase">
  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <PopperDemo type="basic" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>
</div>

Ensure that the styling aligns with your application's theme for a cohesive look and feel.

<a id="Accessibility">
  <h2>Accessibility</h2>
</a>

It’s important to ensure that the Popper component is accessible to all users. Here are some key considerations:

- Use appropriate `aria-` attributes to enhance screen reader compatibility, such as `aria-describedby` for tooltips.
- Ensure that the Popper is keyboard navigable, allowing users to open/close it using keyboard shortcuts.
- Provide sufficient contrast for the text and background colors to improve readability.

<a id="Performance">
  <h2>Performance Tips</h2>
</a>

When using the Popper component, consider the following to optimize performance:

- Avoid excessive rendering by controlling when the Popper is opened. Use state management effectively to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
- For complex popper content, consider lazy loading non-critical elements to improve initial load times.
