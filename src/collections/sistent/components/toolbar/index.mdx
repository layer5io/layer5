  <h2>Customization</h2>
</a>

Toolbars can be customized in various ways to fit your application's needs:

*   **Fixed Position:** Add the `fixed` prop to create a toolbar that stays in place during scrolling.
*   **Density:** Use `variant="dense"` for a more compact toolbar with less vertical padding.
*   **Custom Content:** Combine buttons, text fields, dropdowns, and other controls to create custom toolbar layouts.
*   **Styling:** Apply custom styles to match your application's design system.

When designing toolbars, consider the user's workflow and prioritize the most frequently used actions to improve efficiency and usability.
