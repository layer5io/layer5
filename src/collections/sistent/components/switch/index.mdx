Switches are ideal when a setting is either enabled or disabled, and the user should be able to change it instantly without additional confirmation. They are used to toggle between two states.

<a id="States">
  <h2>States</h2>
</a>

The Switch supports different states including **active**, **inactive**, and **disabled**. Visual feedback is immediate, allowing users to quickly understand the current status of a toggle.

<a id="Labeling">
  <h2>Labeling</h2>
</a>

Labels should be concise and descriptive to provide clarity about what each switch does.

  <div className="items">
    <ThemeWrapper>
      <SwitchDemo type="labeled" />
    </ThemeWrapper>
  </div>

<a id="Sizing">
  <h2>Sizing</h2>
</a>

Switches come in two sizes: **medium** and **small**. The small size is particularly useful for dense layouts and compact UI patterns.

      <SwitchDemo type="small" />
