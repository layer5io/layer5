According to Puppet’s State of DevOps Report 2021, 83% of IT professionals report that their organizations have previously implemented DevOps practices or are doing so right now to unlock higher business value, achieve faster time to delivery, and boost security of systems.
</p>

<p>
However, DevOps teams from many industries frequently struggle to identify the right metrics to monitor and measure success. In this <Link to={DevOps}>infographic</Link>, we highlight the metrics all DevOps professionals should measure to:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify places in the pipeline to speed up deployments.</li>
<li>Make data-driven decisions to improve the deployment process.</li>
<li>Analyze the speed at which products are reaching the market in comparison to competitors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Monitor these 5 metrics to understand how to speed up your DevOps toolchain:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deployment Time</li>
<li>Change Failure Rate</li>
<li>Recovery Time</li>
<li>Release Cadence</li>
<li>Lead Time</li>
</ul>
