  <h3> Introduction </h3>
  
  <p> As businesses become increasingly reliant on cloud-based technologies, securing cloud workloads is becoming 
  more important than ever. Kubernetes has emerged as one of the most popular solutions for managing 
  cloud-based workloads. But how does Kubernetes' security work? </p>

  <p> Kubernetes security is an important topic for businesses and organizations that rely on Kubernetes for 
  their cloud native applications. Kubernetes is quickly becoming the standard for container orchestration 
  and deployment, and it's important to understand the security implications of using this technology. This 
  article explains the basics of Kubernetes security, from authentication and authorisation to network 
  security and more. It also looks at the various tools available to help you secure your Kubernetes 
  clusters and the best practices for keeping your environment safe. </p>

  <p> The article also provides an overview of the impact of microservices and the best practices for 
  maintaining a secure Kubernetes environment. With the right understanding of Kubernetes security, 
  organizations can take the necessary steps to ensure their cloud-based workloads are protected. </p>

  <p> By the end of this article, you'll have a better understanding of how to protect your Kubernetes 
  environment and ensure that your applications are secure. </p> 
  
  <h3> Overview of Kubernetes' Security </h3>
  
  <p> Kubernetes security is a complex topic with many moving parts. This complexity is due in part to the 
  fact that many different security solutions are used in tandem to maintain a secure Kubernetes environment. 
  The Kubernetes security model has three main components: Authentication, authorization, and encryption. 
  The authentication function of Kubernetes security verifies the identity of users attempting to access the 
  Kubernetes cluster. The authorization function determines if a user has the necessary privileges to 
  perform certain actions (such as modifying containers, executing workloads, etc.). Finally, the encryption 
  function of Kubernetes security protects data in transit as well as data stored in internal storage 
  volumes. </p>
  
  <h3> Core Kubernetes security features </h3>
  
  <p> Authentication: This is the process of validating a user's identity when attempting to access a system 
  or network. Authentication can be done using a variety of methods, including username and password 
  combinations, digital certificates, biometrics, and more. </p> 

  <p> Authorisation: This is the process of determining whether or not a user has the necessary privileges 
  to perform certain actions on a specific system or network. In the context of Kubernetes, authorisation 
  determines if a user can create, modify, or delete pods, containers, and other Kubernetes resources. </p>

  <p> Encryption: is the process of converting data into an unreadable, unrecognizable format that cannot be 
  deciphered without the proper key or passphrase. The most common forms of encryption involve the use of 
  public/private key pairs, passwords, and passphrases. </p>

  <h3> Impact of microservices on Kubernetes security </h3>
  
  <p> Among the biggest misconceptions about Kubernetes' security is that Kubernetes inherently secures all 
  workloads running on the platform. While Kubernetes provides a secure environment for running distributed 
  applications, the security model isn’t designed to secure individual workloads. Instead, it secures the 
  container orchestrator itself along with the cluster resources such as nodes, pods, and volumes. While the 
  Kubernetes security model provides the necessary foundation for securing a cluster, it’s up to the 
  organization using Kubernetes to implement security measures at the workload level. Organizations using 
  microservices have unique security considerations. These organizations typically have a large number of 
  single-function applications that are used to handle specific tasks. Using single-function applications 
  can help organizations achieve greater scalability, but it also means that each application has its own 
  security concerns. </p>
  
  <h3> Kubernetes security best practices </h3>
  
  <p> As mentioned, organizations using microservices have unique security considerations. To help 
  organizations with these issues, the following best practices are recommended: Authentication: Use an 
  identity provider that supports multi-factor authentication. This will ensure that all users are verified 
  with two or more forms of identity before they can access the Kubernetes cluster. Authorization : Use IAM 
  (Identity and Access Management) tools to manage access control, role-based access, and RBAC policies. 
  Encryption : Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) certificates to secure all API endpoints, and use the GCP 
  Private network to ensure data is kept private in transit. Logging : Ensure that logs are collected, 
  stored, and accessible for troubleshooting purposes. </p>
  
  <h3> Kubernetes network security </h3>
  
  <p> Kubernetes network security involves setting up the appropriate network security policies to ensure 
  that all traffic within the Kubernetes cluster is secure. It’s critical that the appropriate network 
  security settings are implemented to ensure that only authorised traffic is allowed to enter and exit the 
  cluster. When setting up network security, it’s important to remember that Kubernetes is designed to 
  function as a multi-tenant system. In other words, a single cluster can be used to host multiple 
  organizations or individuals. This means that it’s essential to secure all network traffic using the 
  appropriate tools and techniques. </p>
  
  <h3> Conclusion </h3>
  
  <p> The Kubernetes security model provides the necessary foundation for securing a cluster, but it’s up to 
  the organization using Kubernetes to implement security measures at the workload level. To help 
  organizations with these issues, we recommend implementing the following best practices: Use an identity 
  provider that supports multi-factor authentication, use IAM tools to manage access control, role-based 
  access, and RBAC policies, use TLS certificates to secure all API endpoints, and use GCP Private network 
  to ensure data is kept private in transit. When setting up network security, be sure to remember that 
  Kubernetes is designed to function as a multi-tenant system. </p>
