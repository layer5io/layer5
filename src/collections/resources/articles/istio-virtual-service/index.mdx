<p>
  Istio Virtual Service defines a set of traffic routing rules to apply when host is addressed. Each routing rule defines standards for the traffic of a specific protocol. If the traffic is matched, then it is sent to a named destination service defined in the registry.
</p>

<p>
  The source of traffic can also be matched within a routing rule that allows routing to be customized for every specific client context.
</p>

  The below example on Kubernetes routes all HTTP traffic by default to pods of the reviews service with the label “version: v1”. Additionally, HTTP requests with path starting with /wpcatalog/ or /consumercatalog/ will be rewritten to /newcatalog and sent to the pods with label “version: v2”.
</p>

kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  http:
  - name: "reviews-v2-routes"
    match:
    - uri:
        prefix: "/wpcatalog"
    - uri:
        prefix: "/consumercatalog"
    rewrite:
      uri: "/newcatalog"

        subset: v2

<h2>Virtual Service Configuration Affecting Traffic Routing </h2>

<p>A single Virtual Service can be used to describe all the traffic properties of the hosts, including those for multiple HTTP and TCP ports.</p>

<div>
  <h3>Hosts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The application traffic created by hosts, clients, servers, and applications that use the network as a transport is contained in the physical network data plane (also known as the forwarding plane). 
      As a result, data plane traffic should never have source or destination IP addresses that are assigned to network elements like routers and switches; instead, it should be originated from and delivered to end devices like PCs and servers. To forward data plane traffic as swiftly as possible, routers and switches use hardware chips called application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). A forwarding information base is referenced by the physical networking data plane (FIB). 
    </li>
    <li>
      The destination hosts to which traffic is being sent it could be a DNS name with wildcard prefix or an IP address depending on the platform.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>Gateways</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The names of gateways and sidecars that should apply all these routes. Gateways in other namespaces may be referred to by <code> gateway namespace>/gateway name </code>; specifying a gateway with no namespace qualifier is the same as specifying the VirtualService’s namespace.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>HTTP</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      An ordered list of route rules for HTTP traffic. The HTTP routes will be applied to the platform service ports named <code>‘http-’/‘http2-’/‘grpc-*’, gateway ports with protocol HTTP/HTTP2/GRPC/ TLS-terminated-HTTPS </code> and service entry ports using HTTP/HTTP2/GRPC protocols.
    </li>
    <li>
      The first rule is matching an incoming request which is used.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>TCP</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>  	
      An ordered list of all the routing rules for opaque TCP traffic. TCP routes will be applied to any of the port which is not a HTTP or TLS port. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h3>ExportTo</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>  	
      Exporting a virtual service allows it to be used by the sidecars and the gateways defined in other namespaces. 
    </li>
    <li>  	
      If no namespaces are specified then the virtual service is exported to all namespaces by default.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>
  Destination
</h2>

<p>
  A destination indicates that the network addressable service to which the request/connection will be sent. A DestinationRule defines policies that apply to traffic intended for a service after routing has occurred.
</p>

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: reviews-destination
spec:
  host: reviews.prod.svc.cluster.local
  subsets:
  - name: v1
    labels:
      version: v1
  - name: v2
    labels:
      version: v2

```
<div class="fact-left">
<p>A version of the route destination is identified with a reference to a named service subset which should be declared in a corresponding DestinationRule.</p>
</div>
