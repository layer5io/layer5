<h2>What are practical steps to adopt a service mesh in my enterprise? </h2>

<h3>Piecemeal Adoption</h3>
<p>
  Many organisations wish to take advantage of auto-instrumented observability
  first, taking baby steps toward a full-service mesh after achieving first
  success and operational comfort, to better understand what's going on across
  their distributed infrastructure. It's a high-value, relatively safe first
  step to use a service mesh for its ability to provide enhanced observability.
  First steps for others might be on a parallel path. For example, a financial
  organisation might seek improved security with strong identity (per-service
  certificates) and strong encryption via mutual TLS between each service.
  Others, on the other hand, may begin with an ingress proxy as a stepping stone
  to a larger service mesh deployment.
</p>
<p>
  Consider an organisation with hundreds of existing services running on virtual
  machines (VMs) external to the service mesh that have little to no
  service-to-service traffic, with practically all traffic flowing from the
  client to the service and back to the client. Without immediately deploying
  hundreds of service proxies, this organisation can deploy a service mesh
  ingress (e.g., Istio Ingress Gateway) to gain granular traffic control (e.g.,
  path rewrites) and detailed service monitoring.

<h3>Practical Steps to Adoption</h3>
<p>Here are two common paths:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Wholesale adoption of a service mesh, commonly while designing a new
    application (a greenfield project).
  </li>
  <li>
    Piecemeal adoption of some components and capabilities of a service mesh,
    but not others, commonly while working with an existing application (a
    brownfield project).
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Let's take a look at how the second path manifests itself, because it's the
  path that most people will face (those with existing services) and the
  approach that most organisations take. In this method, incremental steps are
  taken. When teams are comfortable with their understanding of the deployment,
  have gained operational expertise, and derived substantial value, another step
  toward a full mesh is usually accomplished. Since n ot all components of a
  full service mesh are helpful to teams based on their focus or current pain
  points, not all teams choose to take another step. This will evolve over time,
  as full service mesh deployments become ubiquitous. More than this,
  application developers and service (product) owners will begin to rely on the
  power of a service mesh to empower and satisfy their requirements as well.
</p>
<p>
  Which applications should be constructed from the ground up or transformed
  using a new service mesh architecture depends on engineering maturity and
  skill set. You don't have to use all of the features; use the ones you need.
  Given that some service meshes provide a path to partial adoption, the best
  way may be to mitigate risk, baby-step it, and show incremental triumphs. Some
  service meshes can be deployed and digested in a single step. Even if this is
  the case, you might find that you enable only a subset of its capabilities.
  Presence of a service mesh’s capabilities is separate from whether those
  capabilities are actively engaged.
</p>
<p>
  Observability is at the top of the list of reasons why most organizations
  deploy a service mesh initially. You usually obtain a service dependency graph
  in addition to metrics, logs, and traces. These graphs visually identify how
  much traffic is coming from one service and going to the next.   You'll feel
  as if you're running blind if you don't have a visible topology or service
  graph.
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, it could be your current load balancer that is running blind. 
  Most service mesh proxies will come in handy if you're running gRPC services
  and have a load balancer ignorant of gRPC and treats this traffic like any
  other TCP traffic. Modern service proxies will support HTTP/2 and, as such,
  might provide a gRPC bridge from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2.
</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>
  Organizations usually prioritise security last.  They may not want strong
  authentication and encryption when they ultimately do look into security.
  Although it is best practise to secure everything using strongly authenticated
  and authorised services, some organisations fail to do so, resulting in soft,
  gooey centres in their microservices deployments. Some teams are content to
  secure the edge of their network, but they still want the observability and
  control that a service mesh can provide.
</p>
<div class="fact">
  <p>
    Needless to say, it is recommended that you run workloads securely, using a
    service mesh to provide authentication and authorization between all service
    requests.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  Why aren't certain organizations interested in using Service Mesh's managed
  certificate authority? Because it is another thing to operate? When
  connections are established, encryption consumes resources (CPU cycles) and
  can inject a few microseconds of latency. Given this, and to aid adoption,
  some service meshes prominently display installation options that include a
  certificate authority (CA) and installation configurations that do not. Maybe
  you consider the “gooey center” of your mesh to be secure because there is
  little to no ingress/egress traffic to/from the cluster and access is provided
  only via VPN into the cluster. Depending on workload, wallet, and sensitivity
  to latency, you might find that you don’t want the overhead of running
  encryption between all of your services.
</p>
<p>
  Maybe you're just searching for authorization checks, and you're deploying
  monoliths rather than microservices. You don't need any further monitoring
  integrations because you already have API management. Perhaps you use IP
  addresses (subnets) for network security zones. Using identities and
  encryption provided by the service mesh, together with authorization checks
  enforced by policy you specify, a service mesh can help you get rid of network
  partitions and firewalling on Layer 3 (L3) boundaries. You can flatten your
  internal network by policy enforcing, authorization checks across your
  monoliths, making services broadly reachable while granularly controlling
  which requests are authorized. The power of service mesh to analyse and reason
  over details of request traffic much beyond IP addresses and ports (Layer 3/4)
  provides significantly more flexibility.
</p>
<h3>Retrofitting a Deployment</h3>
<p>
  Recognize that, while some greenfield projects may have the luxury of starting
  with a service mesh, most organizations will have existing services (monoliths
  or otherwise) to onboard to the mesh. These services could run in VMs or
  bare-metal hosts instead of containers. Fear not! Some service meshes squarely
  address such environments and help with the modernization of such services,
  allowing organizations to renovate their services inventory by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not having to rewrite their applications</li>
  <li>
    Adapting microservices and existing services using the same infrastructure
    architecture
  </li>
  <li>Facilitating adoption of new languages</li>
  <li>
    Facilitating moving to or securely connecting with services in the cloud (or
    on edge)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For those organisations who adopt a strangler pattern of building services
  around a legacy monolith to expose a more developer-friendly set of APIs,
  service meshes make it easier to insert facade services as a way of breaking
  down monoliths.
</p>
<p>
  With the adoption of a service mesh, organisations can get observability
  (e.g., metrics, logs, and traces) as well as dependency or service graphs for
  all of their services (micro or not). The only change required within the
  service with respect to tracing is to forward certain HTTP headers. With the
  least amount of code change, service meshes are effective for retrofitting
  uniform and ubiquitous observability tracing into existing infrastructures.
