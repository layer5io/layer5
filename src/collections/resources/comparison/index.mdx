<h3>What is Kanvas?</h3>
<p> <a href="https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/kanvas">Kanvas</a> is like Google Workspace for DevOps, as it allows you to create, test, and deploy cloud native architectures collaboratively and easily.
<br></br>
Kanvas is a web-based application that allows you to create and share orchestratable diagrams of cloud native infrastructure for Kubernetes and public cloud services. You can draw shapes, lines, text, and icons to represent your infrastructure components and their relationships. Kanvas also supports freestyle design, meaning that you can customize the appearance and layout of your diagrams without any constraints. Kanvas enables real-time collaboration, meaning that you can invite others to join your sessions and edit the diagrams together. Kanvas is a simple and intuitive tool for designing and communicating cloud native infrastructure for Kubernetes and multi-cloud services.
