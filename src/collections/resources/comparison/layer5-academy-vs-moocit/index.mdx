## Summary

While Moocit lacks content attribution and seamless orchestration with hands-on labs, Layer5 Academy stands out by enabling true learning through interactive, hands-on labs powered by Kanvas—where real learning happens. Layer5 Academy's labs drive students to utilize third-party public cloud providers' infrastructure, meaning more time spent on hands-on activities can increase costs for users paying for their chosen provider's resources. However, public cloud providers featuring Academy content and labs can incentivize adoption by offering credits and discount codes, presented to learners after enrolling in a Challenge, Learning Path, or Certification. Furthermore, Layer5 enhances administrative efficiency with support for bulk invitations for new learners and email announcements for new academy content, underscoring its superior strengths in content creation, learner experience, and administrative capabilities compared to Moocit.
