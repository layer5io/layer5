## Layer5 Plan Features

Layer5 offers tiered plans designed to meet different needs across your infrastructure management journey. Whether you're starting out or running enterprise-scale operations, our plans provide the tools you need for collaborative design and operational excellence.

## Infrastructure as Design

Infrastructure as Design puts you in control of your cloud native environment. Rather than treating infrastructure as a secondary concern, this approach elevates it to a first-class citizen in your design process. With Layer5, you can visually model your infrastructure, define configurations declaratively, and collaborate with your team in real-time.

This paradigm shift means your infrastructure definitions are versioned, reviewed, and tested just like application code. Teams can share designs, iterate on architecture decisions, and maintain consistency across deployments. Infrastructure becomes tangible and discussable—no more ambiguous diagrams or outdated documentation.

### Key Benefits

- **Visual Modeling**: Design your entire infrastructure topology in an intuitive canvas
- **Declarative Configuration**: Define infrastructure behavior through code-like declarations
- **Collaboration**: Build infrastructure designs collaboratively with your team
- **Version Control**: Track changes to your infrastructure with full history
- **Code Generation**: Export designs to Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, or other formats
- **Reusability**: Create and share design patterns across your organization

## Design Review Notifications

Design Review Notifications keep your team aligned throughout the design process. When team members propose changes to infrastructure designs, stakeholders receive timely notifications ensuring that critical decisions aren't missed.

The notification system is flexible and intelligent. You configure which events trigger notifications—new designs shared, pending reviews, configuration changes, or deployment readiness updates. Notifications can be sent via email, Slack, or within the platform, keeping information flowing to the right people at the right time.

### Notification Features

- **Real-time Alerts**: Instant notification when designs are shared or updated
- **Review Requests**: Direct notification to reviewers when their input is needed
- **Status Updates**: Track approval progress and change requests as they happen
- **Integration Points**: Slack, email, and in-app notifications all supported
- **Customizable Triggers**: Configure which events warrant notification
- **Workflow Visibility**: See the full chain of reviews and approvals
- **Escalation Paths**: Automatic escalation for designs awaiting review

## Getting Started

### For Infrastructure as Design

1. **Create a Design**: Start with a blank canvas or select a template to build your infrastructure topology
2. **Model Your Architecture**: Add nodes representing your cloud resources, services, and connections
3. **Configure Details**: Set specifications for each component—replicas, resource limits, networking policies
4. **Share & Collaborate**: Invite team members to view or edit the design
5. **Review & Iterate**: Use feedback to refine your architecture before deployment

### For Design Review Notifications

1. **Enable Notifications**: Configure your notification preferences in plan settings
2. **Set Notification Triggers**: Choose which events should trigger alerts (design shared, review requested, etc.)
3. **Choose Channels**: Select email, Slack, or in-app notifications
4. **Assign Reviewers**: Add team members to the review workflow
5. **Monitor Activity**: Track notifications and respond to reviews in real-time

## Use Cases

### Architecture Planning
New projects start in the design phase. Infrastructure as Design lets you model potential architectures, test different approaches, and get team buy-in before implementation.

### Cross-team Collaboration
Ops teams, platform engineers, and developers often need to align on infrastructure decisions. Design Review Notifications ensure everyone stays informed as designs evolve.

### Compliance & Governance
Organizations with strict requirements benefit from design reviews and audit trails. Approval workflows enforce governance policies before infrastructure changes are deployed.

### Disaster Recovery Planning
Design alternative infrastructure scenarios for disaster recovery. Use notifications to keep your DR strategy current as your primary infrastructure changes.

### Cost Optimization
Review infrastructure designs before deployment to identify optimization opportunities. Notifications keep cost-conscious stakeholders informed of architectural changes.

## Next Steps

Explore how Infrastructure as Design and Design Review Notifications can transform your infrastructure management workflow. Choose the plan that fits your team's needs and start designing infrastructure collaboratively today.
