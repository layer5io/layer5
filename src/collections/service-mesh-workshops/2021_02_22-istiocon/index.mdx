Join Layer5 at the inaugural Istio conference on Monday, Feb. 22nd to Friday, Feb. 26th. [IstioCon](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2021/about/) is a 100% virtual event that is designed to connect community members across the globe with Istio and the Istio ecosystem.

Layer5 will kickoff the event with our renowned service mesh workshop, featuring [Meshery](/meshery), the service mesh manager. Attend our workshop to help you get started with managing your own service mesh!

#### Using Istio

As the third phase in your microservices journey, service meshes provide a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility and granular control over service requests. Service meshes have quickly entered the cloud native landscape filling unmet service-level needs. Organizations that have adopted containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5, service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the popular service mesh - Istio. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.

You will learn to:

- Configure and operate Istio in context of an example workloads and their common use cases
- Manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications
- Enforce policies and rate limiting
- Be confident with ongoing management of Istio
- Understand WebAssembly filters for Envoy and deploy a custom filter
