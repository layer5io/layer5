<h4>Service Mesh Fundamentals with Linkerd - O'Reilly Live Online Training</h4>
As the third phase in your microservices journey, service meshes provide a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility and granular control over service requests. Service meshes have quickly entered the cloud native landscape filling unmet service-level needs. Organizations that have adopted containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5, service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the popular service mesh - Linkerd. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Linkerd alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.
