  <b>
    Envoy - Adaptive Load Control and Distributed Load Testing of Envoy Data
    Planes
  </b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Description</b>: Users configuring their Envoy-based data planes don't
      know how to find the optimal Envoy configuration given their workload's
      resiliency and performance requirements. Nighthawk, Envoy's load
      generator, supports adaptive load control and horizontally distributed
      scaling of itself. Using distributed load testing and the creation of a
      set of adaptive load controllers, Envoy users can be empowered with
      repeatable tooling to automate identification of an optimal Envoy data
      plane configuration.

  <b>Open Service Mesh - Support for WebAssembly filters</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Description</b>: Bring OSM on par with other service meshes that
      support WASM filters in their data plane. OSM's Envoy proxies can be
      extended at runtime with filters that are running in a WebAssembly sandbox
      (
      <a href="https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-wasm" target="_blank">
        https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy-wasm
      </a>
      ). Provide ability to dynamically load and unload Envoy WASM filters. Provide
      general purpose filtering of application infrastrcuture logic, tying business
      logic closer to the mesh.

  <b>Service Mesh Interface - Support for Multi-Cluster Operations</b>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Description</b>: Facilitate federation service mesh deployments across
      Kubernetes clusters, considering for service catalog federation and
      identity federation. Account for 1) multiple Kubernetes clusters using the
      same service mesh, 2) hetrogenius workloads (Kubernetes, VMs, Bare metal)
      using the same service mesh, 3) multiple Kubernetes clusters using
      different service meshes (e.g. Istio and Linkerd), 4) heterogeneous
      workloads using different service meshes (e.g. Istio, Consul).

  <b>What is Layer5?</b>
</p>
<p>
  While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of service
  mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build projects to provide
  learning environments, deployment and operational best practices, performance
  benchmarks, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more.
  Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes Layer5 projects
  forward. New members are always welcome.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Is it Open Source?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on,
  and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration,
  globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms of
  Apache v2.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Google Summer of Code Participation?</b>
</p>
<p>
  The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which
  you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is improving the
  world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will affect people
  you've never met. The Layer5 community includes software engineers,
  researchers, students, artists, system administrators, operators and web
  designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get started.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and
  friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more effectively
  and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best
  solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and strength of
  our community.
