## GSoC 2025 Project Ideas
<br />

#### Multi-player Collaboration: Resilient Websockets and GraphQL Subscriptions

- **Description:** Meshery's current implementation of websockets and GraphQL subscriptions is in need of refactoring for increased reliability and resiliency. This client and server-side refactoring includes use of webworkers and separation of concerns for the client-side, and the use of a message broker for the server-side. The project has implications on Meshery's implementation of multi-player collaboration functionality.
- **Expected outcome:** 
  - Resilient websockets and GraphQL subscriptions for Meshery, enabling multi-player collaboration functionality.
- **Recommended Skills:** Golang, Kubernetes, Azure, well-written and well-spoken English
- **Mentor(s):** <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote">Lee Calcote</Link>, <Link to="/community/members/aabid-sofi">Aabid Sofi</Link>
- **Expected project size:** 175 hours
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Upstream Issue (URL):** https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/13554

#### Support for Azure in Meshery

- **Description:** Enhance Meshery's existing orchestration capabilities to include support for Azure. The <a href="https://azure.github.io/azure-service-operator">Azure Service Operator</a>(ASO) provides a wide variety of Azure Resources via Kubernetes custom resources as first-class <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models">Meshery Models</a>. This involves enabling Meshery to manage and orchestrate Azure services and their resources, similar to how it handles other Kubernetes resources. The project will also include generating support for Azure services and their resources in Meshery's Model generator.
- **Expected outcome:** 
  - Meshery will be able to orchestrate and manage all Azure services supported by ASO. This includes the ability to discover, configure, deploy, and operate the lifecycle of Azure services through Meshery. The Meshery Model generator will be updated to automatically generate models for Azure services, simplifying their integration and management within Meshery. This will be an officially supported feature of Meshery.
- **Recommended Skills:** Golang, Kubernetes, Azure, well-written and well-spoken English
- **Mentor(s):** <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote">Lee Calcote</Link>, <Link to="mailto:mia.grenell2337@gmail.com">Mia Grenell</Link>
- **Expected project size:** large (175 hours)
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Upstream Issue (URL):** https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/11244

#### Distributed client-side inference (policy evaluation) with WebAssembly (WASM) and OPA in Meshery

- **Description:** Meshery's highly dynamic infrastructure configuration capabilities require real-time evaluation of complex policies. Policies of various types and with a high number of parameters need to be evaluted client-side. With policies expressed in Rego, the goal of this project is to incorporate use of the <a href="https://github.com/open-policy-agent/golang-opa-wasm">https://github.com/open-policy-agent/golang-opa-wasm</a> project into Meshery UI, so that a powerful, real-time user experience is possible.
- **Expected outcome:** 
  - The goal of this project is to enhance Meshery's infrastructure configuration capabilities by incorporating real-time policy evaluation using the golang-opa-wasm project. This project will integrate the capabilities of golang-opa-wasm into the Meshery UI, enabling users to experience the existing, powerful, server-side policy evaluation client-side.
- **Recommended Skills:** WebAssembly, Golang, Open Policy Agent, well-written and well-spoken English
- **Mentor(s):** <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote">Lee Calcote</Link>, <Link to="mailto:james.horton2337@gmail.com">James Horton</Link>
- **Expected project size:** large (175 hours)

  Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on,
  and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration,
  globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms of
  Apache v2.
</p>

<h3>About Layer5</h3>

<p>
We want to participate to help first-time open source contributors get started and what will hopefully be a lifelong journey of open source participation. We want to have them have a great first experience, understand what it means to be embraced by empathy and, in turn, to have empathy for others. We are all learning and growing each day. Our organization and community culture has a pay-it-forward mentality. We spend a lot of time with both students and adults alike, tutoring them, supporting them, and watching them grow. We believe that the world has too few truly diverse and perpetually encouraging open source communities. We take our internships very seriously and grow and support interns to dramatically increase their career velocity. We love helping others learn and grow. </p>

<p>
Mentoring and seeing others learn and grow is what Layer5 is all about - they grow, we grow. Layer5 is a platform for mentees to hoist themselves up on and leapfrog from. We’re a platform for shared success. Direct participation in GSoC will be most meaningful to the community. </p>

<p>
We interact daily over Slack, and have an open source project <Link to="/community/calendar">meeting everyday</Link>, which are posted to the community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Layer5io?sub_confirmation=1" rel="nofollow">YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<h3>Google Summer of Code Participation</h3>

<p>
  The key component of these projects is our Community. This community, which
  you will join as a participant in Google Summer of Code, is improving the
  world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions will affect people
  you've never met. The Layer5 community includes software engineers,
  researchers, students, artists, system administrators, operators and web
  designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get started.
</p>
<p>
  We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and
  friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more effectively
  and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best
  solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and strength of
  our community.
