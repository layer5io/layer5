    <b>What is Layer5?</b>
</p>
<p>
While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking
opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit
pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Is it Open Source?</b>
</p>
<p>
Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work
on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration,
globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms
of Apache v2.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Google Season of Docs Participation?</b>
</p>
<p>
The key component of these projects is our Community. This community,
which you will join as an participant in Google Season of Docs, is
improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions
will affect people you've never met. The Layer5 community includes
software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators,
operators and web designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get
started.
</p>
<p>
We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and
friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more
effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find
the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity,
and strength of our community.
