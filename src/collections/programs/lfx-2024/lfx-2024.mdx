### Service Mesh Performance
<br />

#### Nighthawk Advanced Load Controller

**Description**: The adaptive load controller operates by iteratively running optimization routines to ascertain the maximum load a system can sustain. Typically, this maximum load is determined by the system's capacity to handle requests per second (rps). The metrics, such as CPU usage and latency, collected from the system under test (SUT) serve as constraints to assess whether the SUT can sustain the imposed load. However, it lacks comprehensive lifecycle management functionalities. This hinders its adoption and limits its potential for continuous performance monitoring and optimization.

- Expected outcome: Implement mechanisms to trigger alerts and notifications based on performance thresholds or significant changes in key metrics.
Integrate Nighthawk testing with existing CI/CD pipelines for automated performance validation and optimization as part of the development and deployment process.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with Service Mesh, grpc, docker, kubernetes
- Mentor(s): <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote">Lee Calcote</Link>, <Link to="/community/members/xin-huang">Xin Huang</Link>
- Upstream Issue: https://github.com/service-mesh-performance/service-mesh-performance/issues/350
- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/98b9a7d7-4dd4-45aa-96f9-145e058efcee

### Nighthawk Distributed Performance Tests

**Description**: Many performance benchmarks are limited to single instance load generation (single pod load generator). This limits the amount of traffic that can be generated to the output of the single machine that the benchmark tool runs on in or out of a cluster. Overcoming this limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing. Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that arguably more accurately represent real-world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources. 
- Expected Outcome: Implementation of distributed load generation in Nighthawk. Integration of Nighthawk with relevant service mesh performance testing scenarios. Capability to invoke Nighthawk for distributed load testing through APIs and command-line interfaces. Implementation of reporting mechanisms for distributed load testing results.
- Recommended Skills: Golang, familiarity with HTTP/HTTPS performance testing tools, Service Mesh, grpc, familiarity with containerization technologies, like Docker would be helpful.

### CNCF TAG Network
<br />

#### Mapping Kubernetes Resources: Identifying relationships between all standard and custom resources

**Description**: The OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes provides taxonomy, but augmenting a graph data model with formalized ontologies enables any number of capabilities, one of the more straightforward is the inferencing requisite for natural language processing, and consequently, a human-centric query / response interaction becomes becomes possible. More importantly, more advanced systems can be built when a graph data model of connected systems is upgraded to be a knowledge semantic graph.
- Expected Outcome: YAML-formatted definition
- Recommended Skills: DevOps, Kubernetes Administration, Light familiarity with all of the CNCF projects and a desire to study each project and their operators/resources.

### CNCF TAG Network
<br/>

#### Mapping CNCF Landscape one Relationship-at-a-time

- Description: While the OpenAPI specifications for Kubernetes offer a taxonomy, integrating a graph data model with formalized ontologies unlocks a multitude of capabilities. Among these, enabling inferencing necessary for natural language processing stands out as a straightforward application. This, in turn, facilitates the possibility of a human-centric query/response interaction. Importantly, advancing to a knowledge semantic graph from a connected systems' graph data model opens the door to building more sophisticated systems.

- Expected Outcome: 
  - Identifying new technologies from CNCF landscape and creating new YAML-formatted definitions of one or more relationships.
  - Documentation of each relationship - per component.
  - Development of new types of genealogies - new types of ways in which resources relate to one another and how these relationships might be visualized.

- Recommended Skills: Familiarity with Helm charts and Artifact Hub, basic familiarity with Kubernetes, and familiarity with CNCF different projects would be helpful

- LFX URL: https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/bec63054-bc32-4444-b6c5-2b427f527e16

#### Technical Content Creation CNCF Challenges 

- Description: On a periodic basis, the CNCF would like to present a public challenge to those that are interested in participating (e.g. “Challenge: Distributed Tracing with Jaeger”). 

Your mission in this internship is technical content creation of said challenges through use of markdown, Meshery, and any number of other CNCF projects. Challenges will be created using the Meshery Playground and potentially published in the proposed CNCF Hub. They will be similar too, but slightly different from these [example tutorials](https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials/).

Understand that your challenges will be promoted through CNCF channels, reviewed by various project maintainers, and that each challenger (participant) will receive a certain number of points, depending upon whether or not they successfully complete the challenges that you create and in what timeframe they complete those challenges (the faster, the more points). Your challenges will need to vary in level of difficulty. 

- Expected Outcome: 
  - 10+ new challenges published in CNCF Hub (and Meshery Catalog and Artifact Hub).
  - Challenges can contain more than one objective. Points are earned for each objective completed.
  - Bonus: Extend one or more of Meshery’s Learning Paths.

- Recommended Skills: written English, Kubernetes, DevOps, and familiarity with any number of other CNCF projects, like Prometheus, CoreDNS, Istio, Jaeger, Helm, Harbor, OPA, Rook, SPIFEE, Flux, Argo, Flux, Falco, etc., Jekyll, strong organizational skills
