<h3>About Layer5 and its projects</h3>

<p>The Layer5 community embraces developer-defined infrastructure. We empower developers to change how they write applications, support operators in rethinking how they run modern infrastructure, and enable product owners to regain full-control over their product portfolio. Our cloud native application and infrastructure management software enables organizations to expect more from their infrastructure.</p>

<p>Our inclusive and diverse community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and implement cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and more. Our pay-it-forward mentality with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open source spirit that pushes Layer5 projects like Meshery forward. New members are always welcome.</p>

<h3>About Meshery</h3>

<p>Meshery is the open source, service mesh management plane for enabling the adoption, operation, and management of any service mesh and their workloads. There are many service meshes available. Software-defined networking is difficult to understand. Meshery’s aim is to make the power of the network available to the rest of us.</p>

<h3>About our Community</h3>
 
Layer5 is all about <Link to="/community">its community</Link> of contributors.

#### Meshery Model Support for kro ResourceGraphDefinitions (RGDs)

**Description**: Enhance Meshery's existing orchestration capabilities to include support for kro ResourceGraphDefinitions (RGDs) as first-class <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models">Meshery Models</a>. This involves enabling Meshery to manage and orchestrate RGDs, similar to how it handles other Kubernetes resources. The project will also include generating support for ResourceGraphDefinition in Meshery's Model generator.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - Meshery will be able to orchestrate and manage kro RGDs. This includes the ability to deploy, configure, and manage the lifecycle of RGDs through Meshery.
  - The Meshery Model generator will be updated to automatically generate models for kro RGDs, simplifying their integration and management within Meshery. This will be an officially supported feature of Meshery.
- Recommended Skills:Golang, Cuelang, Well-written and well-spoken English, Kubernetes, DevOps
- Mentor(s): <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote">Lee Calcote</Link>, <Link to ="/community/members/mia-grenell">Mia Grenell</Link>

#### Hands-on tutorials using Meshery Playground

**Description**: Learning paths with hands-on labs are a crucial resource for DevOps engineers and cloud-native practitioners. The Meshery Playground provides a live cluster environment, making it an ideal platform for learning every kind of cloud and cloud native technology. Meshery Docs is in need of comprehensive tutorials and scenarios covering common infrastructure management use cases. Mission is to create and publish a series of hands-on tutorials using Meshery Playground. Each tutorial will include step-by-step guides, live demonstrations, and interactive labs using the Playground allowing learners to apply their knowledge directly without the hassle of any configuration.These tutorials will be reviewed by various project maintainers and then published in <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/tutorials">guides/tutorials</a>.
- Expected Outcome: 
  - 10+ new tutorials published in Meshery Docs.
  - Each tutorial should be interactive, guiding users through infrastructure.
  - Tutorials should vary in complexity, catering to beginners and advanced learners.
- Recommended Skills: written English, Markdown, Kubernetes, DevOps, and hands-on experience with cloud-native tools

#### Expanding end-to-end test coverage in Meshery using Playwright

**Description**:  Meshery integrates with many other CNCF projects and technologies. Sustaining those integrations is only possible through automation. To automate functional integration and end-to-end testing, Meshery now uses Playwright as one of the tools for browser testing. End-to-end tests run with each pull request to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality. Expanding the coverage of E2E tests is crucial to improving the reliability of Meshery’s UI and workflows. This project focuses on writing Playwright-based tests for more Meshery components, ensuring robust test coverage across the platform.
- Expected Outcome: Development of comprehensive E2E test cases for additional Meshery components using Playwright.
- Recommended Skills:  JavaScript, Playwright, GitHub Workflows, familiarity with React or Nextjs would be helpful, CI/CD

### Meshery
<br />

#### Model relationships for Azure services

**Description:** Meshery Models are declarative representations of infrastructure and applications. Within these models, Relationships define how different Components (e.g., Kubernetes resources, Cloud services) interact and depend on each other. These relationships are crucial for visualizing, understanding, and managing complex cloud native systems.

This internship focuses on significantly expanding the breadth and depth of Meshery Relationships across a wide array of technologies supported by Meshery. As Meshery continues to integrate with more cloud-native technologies (Kubernetes, public clouds, and all CNCF projects), there's a growing need to accurately model the intricate relationships between their components - vital for providing users with comprehensive insights and control over their deployments.

- Recommended Skills: DevOps, systems administration, solutions architecture. Experience with Kubernetes, Azure and its services.
- Responsibilities:
  - Research and Analyze Technologies: Dive deep into various cloud-native technologies (e.g., different compute services, databases, messaging systems, network services, etc.) to understand their components and how they interconnect.
  - Develop Relationship Definitions: Create and contribute relationship definitions, typically in JSON or YAML format, to the Meshery models. 
  - Model Inter-Technology Interactions: Focus particularly on defining relationships between components from different technologies (e.g., how a Kubernetes deployment relates to an AWS RDS instance, or how a Linkerd service interacts with a Prometheus monitoring component).
  - Document New Relationships: Clearly document the newly defined relationships, their purpose, and how they are represented within Meshery designs, contributing to the official Meshery documentation.
- Expected Outcome:
  - A multitude of new relationships defined both intra and inter Azure services.
  - Policy Contribution: For advanced interns, there may be opportunities to contribute to the Rego policies that evaluate and enforce these relationships.
