<h4 style="font-size: 1.75rem;text-align:center; text-decoration: underline;">
  Project: API Docs for Meshery’s Service Mesh Patterns Playground - Layer5
</h4>
<br />
<h3>About Layer5 and its projects</h3>
<p>
  The Layer5 community represents the largest collection of service mesh
  projects and their maintainers in the world. Our inclusive and diverse
  community stewards projects to provide learning environments, create and
  implement cloud native industry standards, deployment and operational best
  practices, benchmarks and abstractions, and more. Our pay-it-forward mentality
  with every contributor (mentee or not) is a shared commitment by all
  maintainers (and MeshMates - contributor onboarding buddies) to the open
  source spirit that pushes Layer5 projects like Meshery forward. New members
  are always welcome.
</p>

### About Meshery

<p>
  Meshery is the open source, service mesh management plane for enabling the
  adoption, operation, and management of any service mesh and their workloads.
  There are many service meshes available. Software-defined networking is
  difficult to understand. Meshery’s aim is to make the power of the network
  available to the rest of us.
</p>

<h3>About our Community</h3>

Layer5 is all about [its community](https://layer5.io/community) of [contributors](https://layer5.io/community/members). We have designed an onboarding program customized to [meet newcomers](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) where they’re at and developed an onboarding buddy program, [MeshMates](https://layer5.io/community/meshmates) with individuals dedicated to assisting contributors. Layer5 and Meshery have been around for a year and half and have a healthy, growing community of 300+ contributors. The layer5.io website itself is open source and created by 140+ of our contributors.

Technical writers and other contributors are what comprise Layer5 - an open organization, built for the community by the community. Many student contributors have been placed into new jobs with technology companies like Red Hat, Microsoft, and VMware to name a few of the larger organizations. Layer5 expects much from interns and in return, we put them on stage at DockerCon and KubeCon. We promote them and uplift their works. There are [many](https://www.linkedin.com/company/layer5), [many examples](https://layer5.io/blog/category/community) of this on the layer5.io websites. A number of former interns are now project maintainers.

## LFX Mentorship 2022 Project

### About the project

<br />
<p>
  <i>Goal: Create the world’s service mesh playground.</i>
</p>

<p>
  Meshery’s genesis is that of helping teach people about service mesh
  technology and enabling to operate this type of cloud native infrastructure
  confidently. The proposed project is aimed at furthering this mission with
  interactive API documentation connected to a service mesh learning playground
  (a running instance of Meshery). This project sits squarely in the crosshairs
  of our purpose - both for Meshery and Layer5.
</p>

### The project’s scope

<p>
  We will create a new set of interactive documentation for Meshery users to
  both learn how to use Meshery, but also confidently adopt and operate any
  service mesh. We have a number of community volunteers lined up and committed
  to collaboration on the creation of this service mesh playground. The
  technical writer will collaborate with other engineers, working with Swagger
  and Docusaurus.
</p>

<p>Work that is out-of-scope for this project:</p>

- Creation of the Open API specification for Meshery
- Deployment of Docusarous
- Visual design of the site

<p>
  We will bring support from the Meshery CI WG, provide a full-time visual and
  user experience designer and well as three dedicated core maintainers of
  Meshery. We have one strong technical writing candidate for this project, and
  estimate that this work will take six months to complete. We will support this
  technical writer and prioritize any dependencies on the project or community
  that they may have.
</p>

### Measuring project success

<p>To measure success, we will track:</p>

- The number of new API playground users (quantitative - tracked by the system)
- The number of repeat visits of the same users (quantitative - tracked by the system)
- The number of failed attempts to invoke an API (signifies poor documentation) (quantitative - tracked by the system)
- Feedback from users on how intuitive the documentation is (qualitative - tracked through user polls)

<p>
  We would consider the project successful if, after publication of the new API
  documentation:
</p>

- The total count of performance tests run by Meshery increases by 10% (see the current count on [https://meshery.io](https://meshery.io))
- The new number of new Meshery users increases by 20% (currently at ~1,000 users)

<br />

<br />

### Previous experience with technical writers or documentation

<p>
  Our mentors have managed teams of technical writers working on documenting
  enterprise-grade software at large technology companies (Cisco, Seagate,
  SolarWinds). During the span of time, he has worked with technical writers in
  DITA and post-DITA environments (from Word to FrameMaker, structured writing,
  online help, various CMSes, git). Our mentors have worked with technical
  writers on documentation strategy, creating document sets, covering the full
  spectrum of reader personas.
</p>

We interact daily over Slack, and have an open source project [meeting everyday](https://layer5.io/community/calendar), which are posted to the community [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Layer5io?sub_confirmation=1).
