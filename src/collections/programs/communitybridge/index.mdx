    <b>What is Layer5?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
    service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
    projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
    practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking
    opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit
    pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Is it Open Source?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work
    on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration,
    globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms
    of Apache v2.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Google Summer of Code Participation?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
    The key component of these projects is our Community. This community,
    which you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is
    improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions
    will affect people you've never met. The Layer5 community includes
    software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators,
    operators and web designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get
    started.
    </p>
    <p>
    We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and
    friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more
    effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find
    the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity,
    and strength of our community.
