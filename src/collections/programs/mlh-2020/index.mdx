<h2><b>MLH Fellowship Program</b></h2>
<div>
The Major League Hacking’s <a href="https://fellowship.mlh.io/">MLH Fellowship</a> is an internship alternative for software engineers. Instead of working on a project for just one company, you’ll contribute to Open Source projects that are used by companies around the world. You’ll collaborate with a group of 10 students under the guidance of a professional mentor whose only job is to help you successfully contribute.<br/>

<br/>
Layer5’s <a href="https://meshery.io/">Meshery Project</a> is participating in the MLH Fellowship’s internship program in 2020.

<b>Meshery</b>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Description:</b> Meshery is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. Service mesh operators are in desparate need of visualization of their cloud native infrastructure and workloads. Networking is complex and virtual networking even more complex. Interactive visual topologies of service meshes and their workloads are key to helping developers and operators take the blinders off when creating and running microservices and their infrastructure.

    <b>What is Layer5?</b>
</p>
<p>
While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking
opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit
pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Is it Open Source?</b>
</p>
<p>
Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work
on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration,
globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms
of Apache v2.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Google Summer of Code Participation?</b>
</p>
<p>
The key component of these projects is our Community. This community,
which you will join as a participant in Google Summer of Code, is
improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions
will affect people you've never met. The Layer5 community includes
software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators,
operators and web designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get
started.
</p>
<p>
We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and
friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more
effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find
the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity,
and strength of our community.
