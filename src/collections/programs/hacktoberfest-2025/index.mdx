<p>
    Hacktoberfest is just around the corner, and it's an exciting opportunity to get involved in Layer5 projects. You might be surprised to learn how even small contributions can make a meaningful impact on a project. As projects grow, issues can easily go unnoticed, and your efforts in resolving them can truly make a difference while also helping you grow as a contributor.
</p>

<p>As in years past, Layer5 has a number of different projects and a variety of technologies for participants to choose from. For Hacktoberfest 2025, our theme will center on Designing with Meshery. <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> is an extensible, self-service platform for collaborative infrastructure management. Be sure to understand the <Link to="/blog/meshery/comparing-meshery-models-and-meshery-designs">difference between Meshery Models and Meshery Designs</Link>. The Meshery project is looking for contributors to extend these models to support new cloud native infrastructure and their features.</p>

<p>
Prepare for Hacktoberfest and ready yourself for contributing to CNCF projects the easy way with Layer5 <Link to="/community/meshmates">MeshMates</Link> and Maintainers.
