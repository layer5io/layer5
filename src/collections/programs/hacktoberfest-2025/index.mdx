Hacktoberfest is just around the corner, and it's an exciting opportunity to get involved in Layer5 projects. You might be surprised to learn how even small contributions can make a meaningful impact on a project. As projects grow, issues can easily go unnoticed, and your efforts in resolving them can truly make a difference while also helping you grow as a contributor.

As in years past, Layer5 has a number of different projects and a variety of technologies for participants to choose from. For Hacktoberfest 2025, our theme will center on Designing with Meshery. <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> is an extensible, self-service platform for collaborative infrastructure management. Be sure to understand the <Link to="/blog/meshery/comparing-meshery-models-and-meshery-designs">difference between Meshery Models and Meshery Designs</Link>. The Meshery project is looking for contributors to extend these models to support new cloud native infrastructure and their features.

Prepare for Hacktoberfest and ready yourself for contributing to CNCF projects the easy way with Layer5 <Link to="/community/meshmates">MeshMates</Link> and Maintainers. Spend an hour with seasoned, open source maintainers and hack your way through. To get a head start, see our <Link to="/community/newcomers">Newcomers Resources</Link>. Get familiar with the Layer5 community through our <Link to="/community/handbook">Community Handbook</Link>.
