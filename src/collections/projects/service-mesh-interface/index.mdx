  <h3>Purpose and Overview</h3>

  The scope of this initiative includes all service mesh projects participating in the Service Mesh Interface specification. It’s important to acknowledge that conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status.

  <h4>Project Goals</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Provide users with a compatibility matrix identifying the SMI features that
      are supported per service mesh.
    </li>
    <li>
      An easy-to-use, service mesh and SMI-specific tool to give service mesh
      projects and users a suite of repeatable conformance tests.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Project Objectives</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Define what it means to be in conformance with the SMI specifications.{" "}
    </li>
    <li>
      Define a set of conformance tests and what behavior is expected of a
      conforming service mesh implementation.
    </li>
    <li>Built into each participating service mesh project’s release tooling.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Validating Conformance</h4>

  Conformance to SMI specifications will be done through use of a service mesh’s workload. A sample application is used as the workload to test. To facilitate a common set of tests, a sample application has been developed for purposes of providing a consistent workload to apply SMI specs against. A deployment of the <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5">Learn Layer5</a> sample application being fitted to each service mesh.
