  <h3 className="black-text">Performance of Envoy Filters</h3>
  The following analysis compares native Envoy filter performance to WebAssembly (WASM) filter performance using Rust.

      <b>Native WASM at Capacity:</b> <br />
      When every request goes via the
      rate-limit check and then the actual program logic, we see that
      the latency incurred for the WASM code is higher than the Native
      client. This is expected since the native client has processing
      for rate-limiting locally in a process whereas the rust module
      is invoked as an additional thread to do the processing and the
      communication involved with the module incurs an overhead. This
      is prominent in the minimum response time case which represents
      latency just due to rate-limiting logic where every other part
      of the request is already "warm". As we move towards average
      latency, the overhead gets slightly amortized but is still above
      the native rate-limiting case. Our max latency is slightly lower
      than native, but we attribute it to various other system effects
      like TLS handshake and network latencies that usually contribute
      to the maximum tail latency.

    <Col sm={12} md={7}>
    <b>Latency at scale:</b><br />
    When we go beyond the
    application capacity (100 in our example), we start noticing the
    power of a in-line ight wasm module which starts terminating
    requests at the side-car and the core application logic is never
    invoked/loaded. We notice that even the minimum response time
    for a terminated request is about 15-20% faster than invoking of
    application logic since the wasm is a dynamic module in the
    sidecar and we start to avoid complex network redirection and
    invocation of a new container/instance. We also notice that the
    average latency of requests is lower than in the case of native
    client.

      <br /><b>Client Capacity:</b><br />
      Client Capacity figure also shows us that we are able to handle
      more requests than in the native case, although this infometric
      needs to be taken with a grain of salt, i.e. the difference
      might reduce if our application capacity was significantly
      larger than 100.
