<h3>Purpose and Overview</h3>

Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that arguably more accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.

<h4>Project Aim</h4>
The main aim of this project is to enhance the current load generation and analysis technique of Nighthawk to include distributed load testing which may ultimately benefit the meshery to directly adopt the distributed load generation.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Project Goals</h4>
</div>
</Col>
</Row>
<ul>
  <li>
    Identifying the use-cases of Nighthawk. Working with the nighthawk team to
    successfully enable distributed load generation in nighthawk..
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrating the Nighthawk into the Meshery server and improving the load
    handling for Nighthawk using the same.
  </li>
  <li>Handling of the report and displaying mechanisms at the client-side.</li>
  <li>
    Testing & Debugging the Load Generator & finishing the implementation on
    Nighthawk.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Need for the Project</h4>

Currently, Meshery which is a multi-service mesh management plane which can operate
& adapt to various different service meshes only supports a single way load testing.
Understanding the need to support a variety of performance testing scenarios, Meshery
has been equipped with a load generator interface as a point of extensibility to
support the use of different load generators (see <a href="https://meshery.layer5.io/docs/extensibility">
  Meshery Extensibility
</a> documentation). Meshery Load Generation currently has been equipped with support
for both wrk2 and fortio, neither of which support distributed load testing.

<h4>Why NightHawk</h4>

Nighthawk is a versatile HTTP load testing tool built out of a need to drill HTTP services with a constant request rate. It can be used both as a command-line utility and a library.

<h4>Contributors</h4>

This project is being developed by Kush Trivedi as a Google Summer of Code project with the CNCF and in collaboration with Layer5 and Google.
