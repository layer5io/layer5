  If you are in the Layer5 Community, no doubt, you've met
  <Link to="/community/members/nikhil-ladha" className="highlight">
    Nikhil Ladha
  </Link>. If not, I recommend that you join the community and get to know Nikhil.
  He's the Layer5 MeshMate of the Year and here's why: Nikhil consistently volunteers
  to uplift and support others in the community, freely sharing of his time and knowledge.
  His actions embody and espouse the pay-it-forward culture of Layer5.

  quote="It is beautiful how you always respond to messages in the newcomer's channel and try to sort out issues or questions asked. I can personally relate to your kind heart, on the particular times you got on a call with me as a newcomer then and helped me sort out my problems while being so patient and amazing. You really deserve this award Nikhil, and a big congratulations to you!"

2020 was a noteworthy year in many ways. Nikhil's committment to the people and projects of the Layer5 community will forever be at the top of list of mentionables I and others will recall of last year. It was in 2019, though, that <Link to="/blog/community/my-journey-from-a-contributor-to-a-maintainer">Nikhil's journey</Link> in the Layer5 community started and where he first began helping build our healthy, inclusive, and <Link to="/community" className="highlight">diverse community</Link> and our industry-leading, innovate <Link to="/projects" className="highlight">open source projects</Link>. Nikhil's natural disposition to mentoring others and his stewardship on various projects make him a successful MeshMate.

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">What is a Layer5 MeshMate?</h3>

  is a distinction that Layer5 awards select members of the community who innately
  align with our culture of helping others, paying it forward, and a commitment to
  knowledge sharing. MeshMates are Layer5 mentors and ambassadors (not employees).

  quote="Congratulations on the MeshMate of the Year Award, Nikhil, a well-deserved honor for a distinguished gentleman. When I was having a look at the Layer5 community, your member experience blog post stood out and was one of the main reasons for me to join the community. Within the community, it is apparent that your guidance, support, and contributions are very much appreciated. Keep up the excellent work!"

<p>
  A Layer5 MeshMate is individual who has consistently demonstrated their
  commitment to helping community members. The MeshMate program pairs
  experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a
  smooth onboarding experience. Helping community members takes all forms from
  ensuring the member has access to resources, is introduced to others,
  understands the vision and goals of projects, can build and contribute to
  projects, can use projects and have their feedback heard. MeshMates aid in
  identifying areas of projects and activities within the community to engage
  within, which working groups to join, and in help community members grow in
  their open source and cloud native knowledge.
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move
  fast. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates share tips on how to have the best
  community experience possible, but also build a relationship with the
  community member inevitably leaving a lasting mark as is evident from member
  comments about Nikhil.
</p>

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">It's not easy being a MeshMate</h3>

<p>
  With thousands of members in the Layer5 community, many come and go. Many take
  and many give. While we hope that each and every individual that joins will
  find a fit in the community and/or on a project, this isn't always the case.

    quote="The dedication you have shown on the way to this achievement is impressive, Nikhil. People like you are the key to the great community at Layer5."

  Engaging with and investing in community members can be taxing on mentors in
  terms of both their time and their emotional investment in seeing the newcomer
  plant roots, grow, and blossom.
</p>

<p>
  One of the goals MeshMates have is that of enabling the newcomer's passion and
  finding their sweetspot in the community and on a project, so that the
  newcomer ultimately achieves their goals - goals that are often similar, but
  different for each person. To help them acheive their goals, each individual
  is engaged 1:1 by their Meshmate, supporting them in becoming a landstanding
  Layer5 community member and contributor. MeshMates understand that many
  mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all overcome their
  hurdles in finding an area of the community to call home or aspect of a
  project to own.

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">MeshMates are a massive force</h3>
<p>
  In just a year's time, with thousands of people in the Layer5 community and
  500+ contributors to our projects, it's clear that Layer5 MeshMates
  significantly uplift our collaborative efforts and are steady force in the
  community. In process of confirming Nikhil as the winner of the inaugural
  MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the community for validation. Little
  did I realize that meant reaching out to nearly a hundred people whom Nikhil
  has mentored or supported in the Layer5 community. More than a few of them had
  something to say about their time with Nikhil:

<div className="responsive-blog">
  <Blockquote quote="Nikhil, your Meshery journey probably started in an unbuilt way. Each time you help others to start this awesome journey, you construct a better journey for all, a better way to help others. Thanks for everything!"
  person="Jesus" />

<Blockquote
  quote="Congratulations Nikhil. You deserve this title and more. You've been a continuous and steady force in the community and one of the sole reasons why any of our website codebases are still readable :) I admire you both, as an engineer and as a person for the sheer amount of patience you show towards any new member. Thank you for always being a dependable pillar in the community!"

<Blockquote
  quote="Congratulations Mate. It's been a long time coming. Honestly, how do you manage your time. I think it's safe to say that if it weren't for your reviews, half of the codebase in the Meshery UI would be unreadable for new contributors, including my initial commits. Even though we haven't interacted much, you have been a great inspiration and I hope that you keep being that inspiration for others joining Layer5."

  <Blockquote quote="Hi Mate! Thank you for all your extra effort. Like the alpha wolf, you look after everyone in your pack.

I cannot count the number of times you have helped nervous and inexperienced newcomers like me get their first contributions to Layer5 and make it feel like one big family. Your name is a testimony for being 'complete' and you truly are a complete person. Thank you for everything you have done." person="Ruth" />

  <Blockquote quote="Nikhil Ladha is a very knowledgeable person considering all the various contributions that he made to Meshery. He was also very kind to review something that I had written and provided feedback and suggestions to improve it. He once exhibited to the team one of his creations for which he had won an award. He is certainly a very great asset to the team both as a contributor and as a MeshMate." person="Vijay" />

  In recognition a year's worth of paying it forward, and for the inaugural
  award, a new badge identifies our MeshMate of the Year award winner. Only one
  person carries this badge today. I can only guess as to who this ribbon may be
  awarded to for 2021. In the year and a half that Nikhil has been in the
  community, he has touched the lives of many people, including mine. Nikhil is
  my friend. He is the Layer5 MeshMate of the Year.

<p>
  The MeshMate badge is a point of pride for individuals participating in the
  program and looked upon with admiration and veneration by many within and
  external to the Layer5 community.
</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
  Wear your MeshMate of the Year badge proudly, Nikhil.
