    I was introduced to the Layer5 community three months back. Being fairly new
    to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to
    delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm
    welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation
    jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the
    task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings
    hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I
    finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!
    It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being
    a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and
    GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to
    expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a
    continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush
    Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have
    spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the
    project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began
    helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to
    do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I
    recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a
    MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring
    positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward
    to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊

    It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn't
    something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I
    stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of
    projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa
    (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.
  </p>
  <p>
    A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you
    some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I
    recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and
    managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my
    hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous
    tech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too
    ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow
    made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another
    task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a
    peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the
    only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was
    not.
  </p>
  <p>
    I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would
    previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different
    approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was
    amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have
    helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an
    invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I
    have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly
    environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may
    not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having
    a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing
    determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!

    The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a
    close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.
    Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only
    6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came
    to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel,
    after which I visited the <Link to="https://github.com/layer5io">GitHub repository</Link> and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.
  </p>
  <p>
    To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.
  </p>
  <p>
    Impressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon
    began helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading. Experience an open-source community with Layer5 today! Once you’re set up on Slack, do send me a ping to
    say hi. The exciting part, we might even meet as MeshMates 😉
