    Continuing in our Meet the Maintainer series, we have{" "}
    <Link to="/community/members/Nikhil-Ladha">Nikhil Ladha</Link>. Nikhil is a
    maintainer of <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery UI</Link>.
    In this interview, we get to know him a little better and learn about his
    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.

    Nikhil, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the
    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not
    know the backstory as to who Nikhil Ladha is and how you arrived at your maintainer
    role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What inspired you
    to stay?
  </p>

   Sure Favour, it would be my pleasure to share my journey with the vast community of Layer5 
and inspire more people to come and contribute to the vibrant and fast-growing products at 
Layer5. I was introduced to Meshery when I was pursuing my B.Tech by one of my friends, and 
was hooked by the amazing work happening here and the awesome community Layer5 has. 
Though it was only a handful of it back then, it was still very impressive. Slowly, I started gaining 
knowledge of the product and the codebase by contributing to various issues/feature requests in 
Meshery and as time passed by things started to become more convenient yet exciting as we 
were exploring new heights and areas that could open a box of new opportunities for the 
product. This enthusiasm and learning opportunities always kept me hooked to contributing at 
Layer5 which eventually earned me the role of a Maintainer and also a mentor. I have had the 
opportunity to guide/help numerous newcomers in the community and made sure they felt  
inclusive and as inspired to contribute as I did.

    Youâ€™re a <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery UI</Link> maintainer. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
   Being a Meshery UI maintainer is both a privilege and a responsibility on its own. It comes with 
its fair share of challenges and fun. As we all know UI is the primary touchpoint of the users 
interacting with the capabilities of Meshery, therefore I see myself as the custodian of user 
experience, ensuring that the interface is intuitive, accessible, and aligned with the underlying 
functionalities of service mesh management. It means taking ownership of the architecture, 
code quality, design systems, and the future direction of the UI. Itâ€™s not just about fixing bugs or 
adding featuresâ€”it's about making thoughtful decisions that will benefit the community 
long-term and think from the userâ€™s POV. Being a maintainer also involves the critical role of 
reviewing PRs, helping new developers onboard, maintaining a welcoming, inclusive 
environment and advocating for user feedback and community-driven design.

  <p>
    Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
    Oh for sure. Most of my professional career involves working and contributing to open-source 
projects. Layer5 has a different paradigm of its own when it comes to working with open-source 
projects which involves extensive newcomer/onboarding docs for new contributors that 
encourages many first-timers to actively come and start their open-source journey at Layer5. 
Maintaining and creating such a process is a bug task on its own, but that's where the Layer5 
community makes a difference. </p>
 
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>FavourTy:</span>
  <p>
    <Link to="/projects">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open
    source projects. Youâ€™ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.
    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
  I have been mostly focusing on Meshery UI, Meshery Cloud, Layer5 website.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>FavourTy:</span>
  <p>Whatâ€™s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
    I have been involved in the development of quite a lot of cool features in Meshery UI and itâ€™s 
hard to remember which one would top the chart. Some were done by me while many others were done by
other contributors/maintainers. My most favorite one was when we started exploring 
MeshMap (now Kanvas), and that moment itself we realised the endless possibilities it would 
bring to the product. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>FavourTy:</span>
  <p>What is your favorite feature or aspect of UI in this project, and why?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
   Best thing about Meshery is that an admin/user gets all the critical features on their fingertips all 
integrated into one product. Be it service mesh management, managing their k8s infra or 
planning their k8s infra, measuring the performance of their infra etc. All in one place, Meshery!
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>FavourTy:</span>
  <p>What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
  At the initial glance it might look a lot and very difficult to absorb or grasp, but with time and 
thanks to the new user guides one can get a hang around it and slowly discover the great 
nuances that the product has to offer. Test, explore and break things to get the best out of it, and 
thatâ€™s valid for all the tools and products out there. 
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>FavourTy:</span>
  <p>
    Where do you see opportunities for contributors to get involved within
    Meshery and Layer5 community?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
There are a lot of areas that could still benefit from an extra pair of eyes and can be enhanced, 
or a lot of new features that could be added to the product and different projects at Layer5. One 
can simply take a stroll at the open GitHub issues and try to start from an easy going issue to 
something tricky to something extravagant and navigate their way into developing something 
which could potentially be used by 1000s of people. And, itâ€™s not all just about UI, every UI 
needs a hardcore server that handles all this query so that is another part where contributors 
are welcome to come and there is mesheryctl - the cli tool for Meshery. So in short, the 
opportunities are endless!

    Let's get to know you a bit better with some quick questions:  What's the emoji you use most often? Do you prefer movies or books? Would you consider yourself a morning person or a night owl? Over the past year, what's a project or accomplishment you're particularly proud of?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>ðŸ˜€
  <p>
My most used emoji is ðŸ˜Š

I prefer movies over books, anytime ðŸ˜…
 
I can be both, but with time I have been more of a night owl ðŸ¦‰
 
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">

  <p>
    Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors
    or potentially maintainers?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Nikhil:</span>
  <p>
    Meshery, Layer5 is a great place to start your open-source journey and welcome yourselves to 
the vast community it offers and learn from each other. Things might seem overwhelming in the 
beginning but with the right mindset and dedication they get better and smoother. So, buckle-up 
and keep contributing, you never know whatâ€™s waiting for you out there. One day, it could be you 
having this interview as a maintainer at Layer5!
  </p>
