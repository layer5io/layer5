# Meshery Meetings: Where Newcomers Become Open Source Contributors

Open source can feel overwhelming for newcomers. With countless projects, repositories, and unfamiliar workflows, it is easy to hesitate. That is exactly how I felt until I joined the Meshery community. In this post, I will share my personal journey, from attending my first Meshery meetings to submitting my first issues and pull requests, and explain why Meshery’s welcoming environment is the perfect starting point for anyone new to open source.

## A Warm Welcome to Open Source

When I first heard about [Meshery](https://meshery.io), I was curious but hesitant. Open source often seemed like a space reserved for experts. However, Meshery’s focus on collaboration and inclusivity caught my attention. Encouraged by this philosophy, I decided to join the **[Meshery Newcomer Meeting](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing#community-meetings)**.

From the moment I joined, I felt genuinely welcomed. The meeting was not just about onboarding; it created a space where everyone, regardless of experience, was valued and supported. Community members introduced themselves, shared their enthusiasm for the project, and patiently explained how to get started. What stood out to me most was the constant encouragement to ask questions and take small but meaningful steps.

## Taking My First Steps

After the newcomer meeting, I felt ready to contribute. I decided to start small by fixing typos on the [Meshery website](https://meshery.io). This initial task was simple yet impactful. Here’s how I approached it:

1. Navigated the repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/meshery/meshery).
2. Identified typos and opened issues to track them.
3. Created pull requests to propose fixes.

The community’s support made all the difference, as they reviewed my work and provided constructive feedback that helped me improve.

Even small contributions were celebrated, reinforcing the idea that every effort matters in open source. This sense of appreciation and encouragement gave me the confidence to explore more opportunities to contribute.

## Behind the Scenes of Open Source

My next milestone was attending the **Meshery Build and Release Meeting**. This meeting provided a behind-the-scenes look at the technical side of open source collaboration. Here, I observed contributors discussing:

- Workflows and versioning strategies.
- Planning and coordination for managing releases.
- The importance of thorough testing and quality assurance.

What stood out was the sense of teamwork and openness. Every voice was valued, and even as a newcomer, I felt included in the process. Witnessing the collective effort that drives the success of an open source project was both inspiring and motivating.

## Why Meshery Stands Out

What sets Meshery apart is not just its innovative technology but also the community behind it. Meshery’s meetings go beyond technical discussions and become spaces for:

- **Learning**: Newcomers are guided patiently through the contribution process.
- **Sharing**: Ideas and knowledge are freely exchanged.
- **Growth**: Contributors, regardless of their level of experience, are supported and celebrated.

Whether you are fixing typos, writing documentation, or contributing code, your efforts are recognized and valued. This inclusive culture makes open source accessible to everyone, no matter their background or experience.

## A Call to Action for Newcomers

If you have ever hesitated to join open source, let Meshery be your starting point. Here’s how to get started:

1. Attend a **[Meshery Newcomer Meeting](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing#community-meetings)**.
2. Take small steps such as:
   - Fixing a typo or improving documentation.
   - Opening an issue for something you find unclear.
   - Exploring beginner-friendly issues labeled on the [Meshery GitHub repository](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/labels/good%20first%20issue).

3. Use resources like the [Meshery Contributor Guide](https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing) to familiarize yourself with the process.

Open source is not just about code; it is about community. With Meshery, you will find a welcoming group that supports you and helps you grow as a contributor.

## Conclusion

My journey with Meshery has been transformative. From attending my first meetings to submitting my first pull requests, I have realized that open source is less about expertise and more about collaboration and growth. Meshery’s inclusive and supportive environment has made all the difference, and I hope my story inspires others to take their first steps into this exciting world.
