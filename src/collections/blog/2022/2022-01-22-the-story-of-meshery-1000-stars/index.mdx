  <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> took its first steps into the cloud native world in July of 2019 with the goal to ease the adoption and operation of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes as ubiquitous a layer within and outside of Kubernetes deployments. Since then, Meshery as a project and Layer5 as an open source community have <img src={Slack} alt="Slack notification of GitHub stars applied to Meshery and Service Mesh Performance" style="width:60%;float:right;" /> grown by leaps and bounds. Now, we are bursting with pride in announcing that Meshery has reached yet another milestone: 1,000 stars on the Meshery repository on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  As a project, Meshery is comprised of about 30 repositories, and so, in total,
  the project has many more than a thousand stars. The rate by which Meshery is
  accumulating stars only continues to accelerate and is a small moment of pride
  recognized in the community Slack each time a star is added. As we hit the
  1,000+ stars milestone, let's pause to reflect on the project's incredible
  journey since its inception.
</p>

<h3>Why was Meshery created?</h3>

<p>
  Meshery is an open source, vendor-neutral, extensible management plane that
  enables service mesh users to overcome the challenges of complex virtual
  networking,{" "}

    quote="Meshery is the perfect tool for ensuring that your service mesh applications are optimally configured and performing well; it also gives you a fantastic visual insight into what can be a large amount of textual configuration."
    person="Nic Jackson, Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp"
  />{" "}
  empowers them to design and apply patterns containing tried and true best
  practices, and enables developers, operators, and product managers to
  understand and manage their cloud native services with confidence. Meshery is
  the only openly-governed service mesh manager. Given its ability to deeply
  manage Kubernetes, its workloads, and any service mesh, and the highly
  configurable way in which users can load a variety of plugins, the project has
  certainly earned its title as the <i>extensible</i> service mesh manager.

  quote="Open source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So, if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further!"

<p>
  Not long after, Meshery was{" "}
  <Link to="/company/news/cncf-adopts-service-mesh-performance-standard-established-by-layer5">
    adopted by the CNCF
  </Link>{" "}
  in October 2021. With its natural step into the Cloud Native Computing
  Foundation, the contributor community and Meshery's functionality maintains
  steadfast in their rate of growth and use. With continuous improvements in the
  architecture, user experience and in other features regulated by inclusive
  monitoring, the project is gaining traction <i>very quickly</i>.
</p>

<h3>Engagement in the community is on the rise!</h3>

  It isn't just the number of stars that has grown. We've seen a surge of new
  contributors, maintainers, new features, commits, PRs, releases, and so much
