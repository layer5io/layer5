  <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> took its first
  steps into the cloud native world in July of 2019 with the goal to ease the
  adoption and operation of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on
  Kubernetes as ubiquitous a layer within modern infrastructure deployments.
  Since then, Meshery as a project and Layer5 as an open source community have
  grown by leaps and bounds.

  Now, we are bursting with pride in announcing that Meshery has reached yet
  another milestone: 1,000 stars on the Meshery repository on GitHub.
</p>

<p>
  As a project, Meshery is comprised of about 30 repositories, and so, in total,
  the project has many more than a thousand stars. The rate by which Meshery is
  accumulating stars only continues to accelerate and is a small moment of pride
  recognized in the community Slack each time a star is added. As we hit the
  1,000+ stars milestone, let's pause to reflect on the project's incredible
  journey since its inception.
</p>

### Why was Meshery created?

<p>
  Meshery is an open source, vendor-neutral, extensible management plane that
  enables your organization to overcome the challenges of complex virtual
  infrastructure.

  quote="Meshery is the perfect tool for ensuring that your applications are optimally configured and performing well; it also gives you a fantastic visual insight into what can be a large amount of textual configuration."
  person="Nic Jackson, Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp"
/>

<p>
  Meshery empowers teams to design and apply patterns containing tried and true
  best practices, and enables developers, operators, and product managers to
  understand and manage their cloud native services with confidence. Meshery is
  the only openly-governed infrastructure manager. Given its ability to deeply
  manage Kubernetes, its workloads, and any cloud infrastructure, and the highly
  configurable way in which users can load a variety of plugins, the project has
  certainly earned its title as the <em>extensible</em> infrastructure manager.

  quote="Open source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So, if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further!"

  Not long after, Meshery was{" "}

    adopted by the CNCF

  in October 2021. With its natural step into the Cloud Native Computing
  Foundation, the contributor community and Meshery's functionality maintain
  steadfast in their rate of growth and use. With continuous improvements in the
  architecture, user experience and in other features regulated by inclusive
  monitoring, the project is gaining traction <em>very quickly</em>.
