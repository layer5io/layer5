  quote="Aditya was one of the mentees who I guided through the community as the MeshMate, and seeing him grow into a MeshMate and in turn be awarded the MeshMate of the Year award gives me the ultimate level of satisfaction and happiness! His dedication and commitment are commendable and his efforts truly appreciated. In some corner of my mind, I already knew he would be achieving this feat, and finally, the time has come. Many congratulations, Aditya, for achieving this. I wish you more in the future :)"

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">What is a Layer5 MeshMate?</h3>

<img src={MeshMate} className="left" alt="MeshMate" />
<p>
  <Link className="highlight" to="/community/meshmates">
    MeshMate
  </Link>
  is a distinction that Layer5 awards select members of the community who innately
  align with our culture of helping others, paying it forward, and a commitment to
  knowledge sharing. MeshMates are Layer5 mentors and ambassadors (not employees).
</p>

<p>
  A Layer5 MeshMate is individual who has consistently demonstrated their
  commitment to helping community members. The MeshMate program pairs
  experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a
  smooth onboarding experience. Helping community members takes all forms from
  ensuring the member has access to resources, is introduced to others,
  understands the vision and goals of projects, can build and contribute to
  projects, can use projects and have their feedback heard.{" "}
  <Blockquote
    className="pull-right"
    style="position:relative;"
    quote="I've known Aditya ever since he joined Layer5. He is an individual that I've watched grow both as a person and as a developer. He just takes things up willingly and gives his 100% no matter how simple or complex it is, which is something that I truly admire about him. It's not a surprise that he is chosen as the MeshMate of the year, considering the amount of impact he has made."
    person="Nithish Karthik"
  />
  MeshMates aid in identifying areas of projects and activities within the community
  to engage within, which working groups to join, and in help community members grow
  in their open source and cloud native knowledge.
</p>

<p>
  There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move
  fast. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates share tips on how to have the best
  community experience possible, but also build a relationship with the
  community member inevitably leaving a lasting mark as is evident from member
  comments about Aditya.
</p>

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">It's not easy being a MeshMate</h3>

<p>
  With thousands of members in the Layer5 community, many come and go. Many take
  and many give. While we hope that each and every individual that joins will
  find a fit in the community and/or on a project, this isn't always the case.
  <BlockquoteAlt
    style="width:100%;"
    style="position:relative;"
    quote="Aditya and I joined Layer5 around the same time. In fact, he was the one who introduced me to the community and has helped me every step of the way since then. It's incredible to see how much you've grown in your time here. There isn't a single part of our projects that you haven't contributed to. Your dedication and effort are truly inspiring. Congratulations! You definitely deserve this honor and more!"
    person="Debopriya Bhattacharjee"

  Engaging with and investing in community members can be taxing on mentors in
  terms of both their time and their emotional investment in seeing the newcomer
  plant roots, grow, and blossom.
</p>

<p>
  One of the goals MeshMates have is that of enabling the newcomer's passion and
  finding their sweetspot in the community and on a project, so that the
  newcomer ultimately achieves their goals - goals that are often similar, but
  different for each person. To help them acheive their goals, each individual
  is engaged 1:1 by their Meshmate, supporting them in becoming a landstanding
  Layer5 community member and contributor. MeshMates understand that many
  mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all overcome their
  hurdles in finding an area of the community to call home or aspect of a
  project to own.

<h3 style="padding:2rem 0;">MeshMates are a massive force</h3>
<p>
  With all that said, you must have already realized that it is not easy being a
  MeshMate. Only a few get this opportunity by showcasing their abilities and
  commitment to the community. Aditya has always hovered around the horizon of
  MeshMate since the moment he joined the community. In process of confirming
  Aditya as the winner of the MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the
  community for validation. Little did I realize that meant reaching out to
  nearly a hundred people whom Aditya has mentored or supported in the Layer5
  community. More than a few of them had something to say about their time with
  Aditya:

  profile identifies him as the MeshMate of the Year award winner. Only two
  people carry this badge today. I can only guess as to who this ribbon may be
  awarded to in 2022. In the year and a half that Aditya has been in the
  community, he has touched the lives of many people, including mine.

  program and looked upon with admiration and veneration by many within and
  external to the Layer5 community.

  Wear your MeshMate of the Year badge proudly, Aditya.
