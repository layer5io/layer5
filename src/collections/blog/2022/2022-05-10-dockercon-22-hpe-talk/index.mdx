  <h3>
    Cloud Native Management

      style={{ width: "50%", float: "right" }}
    />
  </h3>
  <p>
    Lee Calcote introduces Meshery as a Cloud Native Management Plane, stating:
    <Blockquote
      quote="Meshery does Lifecycle and Performance Management of 10 different service meshes; more than that, it helps with configuration management with Kubernetes and with the Meshery Docker Extension it does the same for the Docker Compose application."
    />
  </p>
</div>

<p>
  As a{" "}
  <Link to="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-captain-take-5-lee-calcote/">Docker Captain</Link>, Lee has always been a proponent of Docker, particularly its enablement of developer workflows. Docker Extensions bring an integrated experience with ecosystem tooling like Meshery — a critical tool for developers configuring and managing cloud native applications.
</p>

  <h3>Cloud Native Identity</h3>

  <p>
    Maximiliano Churichi briefly explains Cloud Native Identity and HPE's open
    source Project Mithril:
  </p>

  <p>
    <Link to="https://spiffe.io">SPIFFE</Link> (Secure Production Identity
    Framework For Everyone) is a{" "}
    <Link to="https://www.cncf.io/projects/">CNCF-incubated</Link> project that
    defines standards for identifying and securing communications between
    application services. The{" "}
    <Link to="https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about">SPIRE</Link> project is
    a production-ready reference implementation of these principles, offering
    APIs for attestation policies, certificate issuance, and rotation.
  </p>

  <img
    src={CloudNativeIdentity}
    alt="SPIRE and SPIFFE in Cloud Native Identity"
    style={{ width: "50%", float: "right" }}
  />

  <p>
    Maximiliano explains how HPE's Project Mithril integrates SPIRE and Istio to
    strengthen service identity in the data plane.{" "}
    <strong>
      Project Mithril leverages the service management capabilities of Istio and
      the strong identity-by-attestation principles of SPIFFE and SPIRE to
      deliver robust and flexible attestation beyond Kubernetes namespaces and
      service accounts
    </strong>
    . It provides end-to-end secure workload attestation based on zero-trust
    principles, regardless of workload location.
  </p>

  <p>
    Improvements from Project Mithril have been upstreamed into Istio and are
    expected in Istio 1.14, enabling users to leverage SPIRE for SPIFFE identity
    management and stronger attestation mechanisms.

<h3>How the Docker Extension for Meshery enables single-click deployment</h3>

<img

  alt="Docker Extension for Meshery"
  style={{ width: "50%", float: "left", paddingRight: "2rem" }}
/>

<p>
  The new Meshery Docker Extension brings{" "}
  <Link to="/meshmap">Layer5 MeshMap</Link>, the world's only visual designer
  for Kubernetes and service mesh deployments, to millions of developers’
  desktops. Developers and operators can visually configure and operate cloud
  native infrastructure using MeshMap’s low-code visual designer.
</p>

<p>
  Maximiliano Churichi of HPE describes how Meshery conveniently integrates
  multiple services into Docker:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>
      Kubernetes and service mesh support for your Docker Compose apps
    </strong>{" "}
    — Import Docker Compose apps and deploy them to Kubernetes or any service
    mesh.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Visual design of Kubernetes applications</strong> — Use{" "}
    <Link to="/meshmap">MeshMap</Link> as a visual topology designer for Docker
    Compose, Kubernetes workloads, CRDs, and operators.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Single-click deployment</strong> — 250+ Kubernetes operators and
    60+ cloud services ready to use alongside Docker Desktop’s local Kubernetes.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Detection of Kubernetes environments</strong> — Scan kubeconfigs,
    switch clusters, or manage them concurrently.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Maximiliano demonstrates MeshMap</h3>
