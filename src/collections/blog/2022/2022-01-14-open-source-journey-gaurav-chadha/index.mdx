<p>
  Heyüëã, I am Gaurav Chadha, a student from New Delhi, India with lots of dreams, ambitions, and zeal to learn and grow more each and every day.
</p>
<h2 id="journey">How did it all begin?</h2>
<p>
My journey in open source started with late-night surfing on LinkedIn.
I saw a post about the Layer5 organization and open source which drove me to their website and{" "}<a href = "https://slack.layer5.io">Slack workspace</a>. And then, üí• a single-click was all it took to kickstart my journey in Open Source and set in-motion a new chapter in my career development and relationships with new colleagues. 
I would say this was my best ever decision in life till now.
</p>
<h2 id="firs-pr">Getting started in the community</h2>
<p>
Despite the warm welcome that I receive upon joining Layer5's Slack workspace, I was a bit shy to introduce myself in the{" "}<a href = "https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/C019426UBNY">#newcomers channel</a>, but then I saw so many other folks introducing themselves. My inner voice asked, "If they can do it, why can't I?", so I went ahead and introduced myself to the community. 
The best part for newcomers in Layer5 is that not only is each individual warmly welcomed, but that
Layer5 {" "} <a href = "https://layer5.io/community/meshmates">MeshMates</a> and Community Managers host a weekly meeting (see the{" "}<a href = "https://layer5.io/community/calendar">community calendar</a>) dedicated to the success of newcomers, helping each person find a foothold in the community. The overview provided in each weekly Newcomers meeting gives you the leg up that you need to get started with any of{" "} <a href = "https://layer5.io/projects">Layer5's projects</a> and orients you to the how the community works (the{" "} <a href = "https://layer5.io/community/handbook">community handbook</a> is an excellent resource in this regard) and who to contact in your areas of interest.
</p>
<p>
  I highly recommend all newcomers to engage as much as possible in the community. You will gradually start seeing a change in yourself.
</p>

<h3 id="first-pr">Way to my First Pull Request üèÅ</h3>
<p>
I still remember at that time I was just a beginner with Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and most of the issues on the repository were going over my head. 
So I started with a very beginner-friendly issue about changing a background of a component and who would have thought this changing background issue will eventually change my life in open source. 
Then I made my first ever pull request in Layer5 and that got merged!
</p>
<p>
Try out some good first issues here{""} <a href = "https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">Layer5</a> {""} ,<a href = "https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">Meshery</a>üíª
</p>
<h3 id="more-prs">From 1 Pull Request to 90+ Pull Requests Merged üöÄ</h3>
<p>
 After my first pull request got merged I really got pumped up with joy and told myself that I can do more. This journey of learning and pull requests was not at all easy for me, it took almost 9 months of continuous dedication and effort. There are many great folks I met here in the community, who helped me and taught me new interesting concepts. 
 A big thanks to all of them, this was not possible without their guidance and support.
</p>
<h2 id="learnings-at-Layer5">Things I learned at Layer5</h2>
<p>
   There are a variety of things I learned at Layer5 and a lot I'm learning currently. I gained much technical knowledge as well as soft skills in these 9 months. I spend most of my time working on the UI of Meshery and its various projects. 
   In terms of technical items I learned React, Docker, Kubernetes, new JavaScript concepts, etc.
</p>
<p>
  I would say Layer5 is the best in terms of work ethics, community management, a healthy work environment, and a lot more. 
  You can gain real-life working experience on such big projects and guidance related to your career.
</p>
<h2 id="learnings-at-Layer5">How I landed an internship at Layer5?</h2>
<p>
  I gradually started learning about the project and made myself choose one area to start with and continued to explore further. I kept pushing myself with patience until I feel strong and capable enough to
  take responsibilities and give my best to the community, Then I asked and applied for an internship and eventually, I got selected.
</p>
<p>Now I can make more impact and grow more under the right guidance.üòÉ</p>
<h2 id="apart-from-coding">Apart from coding</h2>
<p>
  Besides coding at Layer5, I made many new friends, great experiences, and memories.
</p>
<p>
  At last, I would say, join this amazing community and experience the change in yourself. This will open the doors for opportunities for you. Just be tenacious and push yourself, that's all that I did.
</p>
<p>
  Thank you
