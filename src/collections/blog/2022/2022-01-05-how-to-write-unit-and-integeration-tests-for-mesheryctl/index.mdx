<div class="intro ">
<p>Delivering a high quality user experience is our pinnacle goal in the design of Meshery's CLI: <code>mesheryctl</code>. Delivering a high quality user experience means testing both qualitatively and quantatively. As a concept, quality - whether you're talking about software or anything else - can be directly measured by consistency. A quality user experience is consistent and consistency of <code>mesheryctl</code> is reinforced by its many unit tests.</p>
</div>

<p><code>mesheryctl</code> is written in Golang. In the Meshery project, we use CodeCov to calculate the code coverage across <code>mesheryctl</code>'s line of code. And there are plenty of lines of code. Achieving high percentages of code coverage in Meshery's CLI with grows in criticality as we bring more features into <code>mesheryctl</code> as a robust and sophisticated command line client of Meshery. Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components. </p>

<p>High levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.

<p>Unit Tests can be written in two ways:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand
        <ol>
            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>
            <li>Grab console output</li>
            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>
            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>
            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>
            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions
        <ol>
            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>
            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Example tree graph</h3>
<p>This example of a tree graph (from <a href="https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.</p>

<h3>Integration Tests</h3>

<p>Integrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.</p>

<p>The integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.</p>

<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>

<p>Writing tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>
    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>
    <li>Guide: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>. This guide will briefly introduce how tests are supposed to be written for mesheryctl.</li>
    <li>Contributing to Tests doesn’t always mean writing new tests, It also means improving the effectiveness of already written-ones.</li>
    <li> Search for Issues marked with area/tests in <a href="https://github.com/meshery/meshery">GitHub - meshery/meshery</a>: Meshery, the service mesh management plane.</li>
</ul>

<p>The impact that you make with by writing even a single test is quite high. Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review! Let’s get <code>mesheryctl</code> 100% code coverage badge.</p>
