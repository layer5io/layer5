<p>
  Detroit welcomes the largest open-cloud and container-based developer events and workshops in the world. The event offers tutorials, keynotes, and networking 
  opportunities across five days. There are a few unique events or workshops we are excited for! 
</p>
<p>
  Layer5 has three talks at the event. We have two Project Office Hours talks on Meshery and Service Mesh Performance. During Project Office Hours, project 
  maintainers will be available for participants to speak with, learn more about, ask questions, and learn about new features and planned updates. The third talk is 
  on the state of the cloud native network. 
</p>


<h2>Security Slam</h2>
<p>
  Layer5 is participating in the <a href = "https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/experiences/#security-slam">Security Slam</a> again this year. Security Slam started at the beginning of October and will end at the conference. The program 
offers a chance to not only strengthen the security of your project but also to contribute $50,000 to the diversity scholarship fund. Sonatype and CNCF are working 
together as part of a Google-sponsored initiative to assess how well projects adhere to CNCF's security criteria. Each project that achieves full security will get 
a $2,500 donation from Google for the CNCF's Diversity Scholarship Fund.
</p>

<h2>Kid’s Day</h2>
<p>
Kid's Day will be held on October 23, the day before the main event begins! In two fantastic STEAM workshops, this is meant to provide young creatives in the Detroit 
area the chance to unleash their thoughts. Children are not required to register for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in order to take part in Kid's Day. You can 
  pre-register for the same <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVosJ43gSGC_d2Uenxe4vjdihHENwfSL5-acLZljxKgvyKyg/viewform">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Contribfest</h2>
<p>
At this year's conferences, we have <a href = "https://kccncna2022.sched.com/overview/type/ContribFest?iframe=no">Contribfest</a>, which will offer a forum for tracking technical debt, eliminating bugs, and resolving open issues and requests 
in CNCF projects. Project contributors and maintainers come together during Contribfest in a common area to work on outstanding issues of various sizes. Projects 
like Knative Eventing, KubeVirt, Ago, Flux, and Prometheus are ready for Contribfest cleaning. 
</p>

<h2>Resumé Writing Workshop</h2>
<p>
Attendees are encouraged to join this unique DEI event, which will feature a resume writing class, mingling, networking, and refreshments. The event will take place 
on October 25 from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and is sponsored by Visit Detroit. Scholarship recipients and regional groups that support diversity, equality, and inclusion 
in technology have received special invitations.

<h3>The State of the Cloud Native Network: Deep-dive from TAG-Network</h3>
<p>
NATs, Network Service Mesh, BFE, Contour, Kuma, Service Mesh Interface, Chaos Mesh, Open Service Mesh, Emissary, k8gb, Service Mesh Performance, Submariner, Cilium, 
Meshery, Fab Edge, Istio, Nighthawk, Aeraki, and FabEdge are just a few of the many terms used to describe cloud native networking. The size might be intimidating.
</p>
<p>
From fundamental L3 Connectivity to the newest in Service Mesh, the third session will cover the big picture of Cloud Native Networking in the CNCF and how to put 
it all in a context you can utilize.
