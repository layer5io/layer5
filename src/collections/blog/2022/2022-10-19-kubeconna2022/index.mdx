<h3>Other Activities at KubeCon NA 2022</h3>

<h4>Security Slam</h4>
<p>
  Layer5 is participating in the <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america/attend/experiences/#security-slam">Security Slam</a> again this year. Security Slam started at the beginning of October and will end at the conference. The program offers a chance to not only strengthen the security of your project but also to contribute $50,000 to the diversity scholarship fund. Sonatype and CNCF are working together as part of a Google-sponsored initiative to assess how well projects adhere to CNCF's security criteria. Each project that achieves full security will get a $2,500 donation from Google for the CNCF's Diversity Scholarship Fund.
