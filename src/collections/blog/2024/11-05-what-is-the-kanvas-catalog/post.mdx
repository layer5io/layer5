### What is the [Kanvas Catalog](/cloud-native-management/catalog)?

Think of it as a hub for sharing and discovering best practices, reusable templates, and operational patterns for Kubernetes and cloud-native infrastructure. It's like a marketplace where you can find and contribute pre-built configurations designed for various use cases.


### What can you find in the Catalog?

- Design Patterns: Ready-made blueprints for common infrastructure and application architectures. These patterns can save you significant time and effort in designing your deployments.  
- Filters and Applications: Pre-configured filters for Envoy proxies, WebAssembly filters, and complete application deployments.
- Meshery Designs: Share and reuse your own Meshery configurations, making it easier to collaborate and standardize your deployments.  
- Meshery Models: Share and reuse your own Meshery models, making it easier to collaborate and standardize your component library.

#### Why is the Catalog useful?

- Accelerated Development: Leverage existing patterns to jumpstart your projects and avoid reinventing the wheel.
- Community Knowledge: Benefit from the collective experience of the Layer5 community and industry best practices.  
- Standardization: Promote consistency and reduce errors by using predefined configurations.
- Collaboration: Share your own designs and contribute to the growing collection of patterns.
