  <p>
    Continuing in our Meet the Maintainer series, we have{" "}
    <Link to="/community/members/yash-sharma">Yash Sharma</Link>. Yash is a
    maintainer of <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery UI</Link>.
    In this interview, we get to know Yash a little better and learn about his
    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.

    Yash, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the
    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not
    know the backstory as to who Yash is and how you arrived at your maintainer
    role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you
    stay?
  </p>

  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    Thanks for having me, Hargun, I got into open source about two years ago,
    not really expecting to get so wrapped up in it. I found Layer5 and the
    community through a Twitter post and thought, "Why not?" So, I jumped in.
    The more I got involved, the more I saw how pumped the team and maintainers
    were about Meshery and helping others, and it just got me hooked. I started
    with some smaller, more routine issues but quickly moved on to bigger
    challenges and started getting recognized. One time, during a meeting, Lee
    said something that stuck with me, it’s become one of my go-to quotes. He
    was like, "You don't start working like a maintainer after becoming one, you
    act like a maintainer and do the work before you're promoted." That really
    clicked for me. So I started thinking like a maintainer, doing the stuff
    that isn’t always glamorous but really matters. Eventually, I took on more
    responsibilities, and before I knew it, I became a maintainer.

  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>
    You’re a <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    Honestly, being a maintainer is about taking responsibility for a big part
    of the project with taking care of small things too at the same time, and I
    really enjoy that. One of my favourite things about it is that it lets me
    think more broadly about what we’re doing. As a contributor, you often focus
    on the details, but as a maintainer, you get to step back and see the bigger
    picture, which is super rewarding.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>
    Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    I’ve contributed to other open source projects, but I didn’t really get a
    chance to get involved deeply. I think it’s mostly because a lot of those
    projects don’t have an active community, which makes it tough to get
    involved. However, when I joined Layer5, everything changed. I quickly
    figured out how to start contributing, and the community managers were super
    helpful and always around to give a hand. You just don’t see that kind of
    support in a lot of other open source projects.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>
    <Link to="/projects">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open
    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.
    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    Absolutely, Layer5 has a number of active open source projects, and I’ve
    contributed to quite a few of them. But my main focus has been on Meshkit,
    Sistent, Meshery Extensions, and, of course, Meshery itself.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    Haha good one, this year I got a chance to represent Meshery at KubeCon
    which was really an amazing experience for me. I gave a demo of Kanvas and
    during representation and during that I was collaborating with another user
    which really showed Meshery’s capability.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>What is your favorite feature in Meshery UI?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    <Link to="https://meshery.io/">Meshery</Link> is an extensible platform and I like this feature of it, it gives Meshery a whole new powerful capability to interact with various
    technologies in the ecosystem and use it as an extension. My favourite one
    is Kanvas, though.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    I definitely encourage you to join the meetings. They’re a great way to
    connect with the maintainers in real time. Text chats just don’t do it
    justice when it comes to letting them really get to know you. Video calls
    are way better for that and give you a chance to show yourself to the
    project leaders and maintainers.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">

  <p>
    Where do you see opportunities for contributors to get involved within
    Meshery and Layer5 community?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    Meshery is growing very fast, it is the 9th fastest growing project under
    CNCF. There are many opportunities open for you to contribute. Start
    with joining community, introducing yourself and sharing your skill. This
    will help community managers to put you in right direction based on your
    skills. All areas are consistently in need of help, including best at this
    time to contribute like Meshery's CLI client, Meshery Server and digital
    marketing.
    <br/>
    Out of a 100+ repos that the Layer5 community stewards, two are currently closed: Kanvas and Cloud. Both of these projects were created and are actively being developed by open source contributors, though. There are ~15 open source contributors who working on it now, who meet daily. New contributors in the community routinely express interest and are invited to participate, and are extremely well supported as they do. In other words, the source is currently closed (subject to change), but any community member here that shows interest, demonstrates competence and consistency of participation is readily invited to join in.
    <br/>
    The core team working on these two projects meets Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri at 9:00am Central / 7:30pm IST on <Link to = "https://meet.layer5.io/team">meet.layer5.io/team</Link>. You are most encouraged and welcome to partake.
    <br/>
    Between the two projects, ~100 different contributors have helped create these two project to date.

    Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person
    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re
    particularly proud of?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    I’d definitely recommend reading 'Six Easy Pieces' by Richard Feynman. It’s
    a fantastic book, especially if you’re a science lover like me, haha.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>
    Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors
    or potentially maintainers?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>
    Good question, I’d say think about the long-term. People are more likely to
    invest in you if they see you’re committed for the long term. If you seem
    like you’re just looking for a quick win, it sends a message to the
    maintainers that they might not want to put too much into you. And of course
    try to make high-quality contributions; it doesn't matter if it’s small or
    big.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Hargun:</span>
  <p>
    In other words, whether your contribution is big or small, it sounds like
    aiming for high-quality contributions that add value to the projects is key.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Yash:</span>
  <p>You summarized it perfectly, yes I agree with you Hargun.</p>

    The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like
    Yash. Be like Yash. Join the{" "}
