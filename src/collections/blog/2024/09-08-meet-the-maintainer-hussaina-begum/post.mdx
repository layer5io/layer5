    <Link to="/community/members/hussaina-begum">Hussaina Begum</Link>, Staff Engineer at VMware. Hussaina
    is a maintainer of{" "}
    <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery CLI</Link>. In

  <p>
    Hussaina, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of
    the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may
    not know the backstory as to who Hussaina is and how you arrived at your
    maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What
    made you stay?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    I wanted to contribute to open source for a long time and finally made up
    my mind to get into the world of open source during Hacktoberfest 2020.
    Meshery was one of the projects I contributed to and it had a well defined
    structure and meetings for everyone - Newcomers call, Developers call,
    Websites (Frontend development) call, CI/CD call and Community call, etc.
    Also, the MeshMate program where the existing Meshery maintainers help the
    newest members to get started. Meshery project aligned with my networking
    background and my goal towards backend development using golang. Last but
    not the least, lighthearted jokes from Lee during the development call.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    Youâ€™re a Meshery Maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does
    being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    Lots of learning. Though I started out small in Meshery with a
    documentation PR, Meshery community had so much knowledge to share. With
    their support, I could start on `mesheryctl` UX improvements. I have seen many bright engineers implementing great features in Meshery. I draw inspiration from them and try to pay it forward by helping new members of the community.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    <Link to="/projects">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open
    source projects. Youâ€™ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.
    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?
    <i>Psst.</i> Also, which oneâ€™s your favorite? I wonâ€™t tell.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    I have contributed to mesheryctl, meshkit and meshery.io projects so far,
    It's hard to pick one.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>Whatâ€™s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://playground.meshery.io">Meshery Playground</a> is an awesome system and a something of a hidden gem in cloud native ecosystem. I also remember the `mesheryctl perf` CLI demo I have done on the Meshery office hours from one of the Kubecon events and am proud of this. Kudos to all the contributors of `mesheryctl` command development and refactors.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    What do you anticipate will be Mesheryâ€™s biggest announcement this year?
  </p>

  <p>What is your favorite Meshery CLI command?</p>
</div>

  <p>mesheryctl system start</p>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?</p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    Use Slack effectively and leverage discuss forum, talk to MeshMates and
    maintainers, they are all ears to the issues you face while starting out.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery
    and the Layer5 community?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    Work on the long pending `system config` CLI improvements and contribute to
    other Meshery projects.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    Interesting. Do expand on that: What do you think Meshery could offer in
    addition to what it already does?
  </p>

    Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person
    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that youâ€™re
    particularly proud of?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    eyes emoji. My preference is a book compared to a movie. I am a Night Owl
    w.r.t. work, however, I use my early mornings for my fitness goals. I have
    not been active lately, however removing dependency on CLIs in `mesheryctl
    system config` would be something I would consider a good milestone item for
    me.

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the
    developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    I like listening to kubernetes podcasts and I follow the internal slack
    channels for upstream activities at VMware. Also, attending the local KCD
    events helped me understand the latest developments across various k8s
    projects. Being a program committee member has given me good understanding
    of developments across a specific technology area, let it be security and
    identity area or the world of service meshes.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Vivek:</span>
  <p>
    Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors
    or potentially maintainers?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Hussaina:</span>
  <p>
    Show up and attend the meetings which align with your expertise and areas
    you would like to learn or contribute to. Make use of the Meshmates and
    Meshery slack and discuss forums are pretty active and everyone is eager to
    help.
  </p>

    The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like
    Hussaina. Be like Hussaina. Join the{" "}
