Join Layer5 at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA, Salt Lake City, Utah!


<p>
Join the Meshery project at KubeCon NA 2024 from November 11th to November 16th, 2024 and get introduced to collaborative cloud native management and Meshery open source maintainers.
</p>

### Session: Meshery - Visualizing Kubernetes Resource Relationships with Meshery

<p>
Meshery and its extensions empower you to navigate cloud native infrastructure in complex environments. This lighting talk delves into the human-computer interaction (HCI) principles that underpin MeshMap's intuitive visualization of Kubernetes resources and the various forms of inter/relationships with other CNCF projects' resources.

Human-Computer Interaction Principles in Meshery:

<ul>
  <li>Cognitive Load: How Meshery reduces cognitive load by presenting complex information in a structured and visually digestible manner.</li>
  <li>Mental Models: How Meshery aligns with users' mental models of Kubernetes environments, facilitating comprehension and navigation.</li>
  <li>Visual Perception: How Meshery leverages visual cues, colors, and layout to guide users' attention and highlight critical information.</li>
</ul>
