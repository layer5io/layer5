**Effortless Import: From Compose to Meshery**

Get started quickly by importing your existing Docker Compose applications directly into Meshery. The extension streamlines the process, eliminating the need for manual configuration. Simply navigate to Meshery and leverage the intuitive UI to import your Compose file. Meshery intelligently parses the file, recognizing your application's components and dependencies.

**Seamless Deployment to Kubernetes**

With your application imported, take advantage of Meshery's robust deployment capabilities.  Deploy your multi-container application to a Kubernetes cluster with a single click. Meshery handles the intricacies of the deployment process, ensuring your application runs smoothly within your Kubernetes environment.

**Visualize Your Application with MeshMap**

Gain valuable insights into your application's health and performance with MeshMap, Meshery's interactive service graph.  MeshMap provides a clear visual representation of your application's architecture,  allowing you to easily identify dependencies and potential bottlenecks.

### Interactive Management with MeshMap



[MeshMap](/cloud-native-management/meshmap) empowers you to manage your application directly within the visualized service graph.  The web-based interactive terminal integrated with MeshMap grants you the ability to execute commands on individual containers or services within your application. This eliminates the need to switch between different tools or terminals, streamlining troubleshooting and management tasks.
