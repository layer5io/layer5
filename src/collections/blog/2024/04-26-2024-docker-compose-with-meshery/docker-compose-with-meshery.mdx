<h2>Effortless Import: Docker Compose as Meshery Design</h2>

<p>Get started quickly by importing your existing Docker Compose applications directly into Meshery. The extension streamlines the process, eliminating the need for manual configuration. Simply navigate to Meshery and leverage the intuitive UI to import your Compose file. Meshery intelligently parses the file, recognizing your application's components and dependencies.</p>

<p>Import your existing designs and existing infrastructure configurations into Meshery. The platform supports a variety of application definition formats, and you can import designs using either the Meshery CLI or the Meshery UI.</p>

**Supported Design Definition Formats**

Meshery supports the following design definition formats:

- [Kubernetes Manifests](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/)
- [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/)
- --> **[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)**
- [Meshery Designs](https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/designs)

#### Import Docker Compose Apps Using Meshery CLI

<strong>Step 1: Install Meshery CLI</strong>

<p>
Before you can use the Meshery CLI to import a Docker Compose app, you must first install it. You can install Meshery CLI by <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/installation#install-mesheryctl">following the instructions</a>.
</p>

<strong>Step 2: Import the Design Manifest</strong>

Once you have created your Design Definition file, you can use the Meshery CLI to import your Docker Compose app into Meshery. To do this, run the following command:

```shell
mesheryctl pattern import -f [file/url] -s [source-type]
```

This command enable users to import their existing designs from sources as

- Helm Charts
- Kubernetes Manifests
- Docker Compose

**Example :**

```shell
mesheryctl pattern import -f docker-compose.yaml -s "Docker Compose"
```

### Seamless Deployment to Kubernetes

<p>With your application imported, take advantage of Meshery's robust deployment capabilities.  Deploy your multi-container application to a Kubernetes cluster with a single click. Meshery handles the intricacies of the deployment process, ensuring your application runs smoothly within your Kubernetes environment.</p>

### Visualize Your Application with MeshMap

Gain valuable insights into your application's health and performance with MeshMap, Meshery's interactive service graph.  MeshMap provides a clear visual representation of your application's architecture,  allowing you to easily identify dependencies and potential bottlenecks.

### Interactive Management with MeshMap

[MeshMap](/cloud-native-management/meshmap) empowers you to manage your application directly within the visualized service graph.  The web-based interactive terminal integrated with MeshMap grants you the ability to execute commands on individual containers or services within your application. This eliminates the need to switch between different tools or terminals, streamlining troubleshooting and management tasks.

## Seamless Integration with Docker: A Powerful Partnership
