  Thanks to our open source contributors, Layer5 projects are well represented
  at KubeCon. Attend our talks to help you get started with managing your own
  service mesh!

<h4 class="date"> November 18, 2020 </h4>
As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic
interfaces to interact with them. The following three open specifications solving
the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service
meshes: Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and Service Mesh Interface (SMI), Multi-Vendor
Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet). Attend to learn what makes each of these specifications
unique and why they are very much needed.

  <b>CNCF SIG Network: Intro and Deep-Dive</b>

<h4 class="date"> November 20, 2020 </h4>
<b>It’s the network!</b> is the cry of every system administrator, every
developer. With the increased prevalence of <a href="https://kccncna20.sched.com/event/etsE/cncf-sig-network-intro-deep-dive-lee-calcote-layer5">

</a>
microservice-based distributed systems, it’s true - networking as a discipline
has never been more critical in the efficient operation of cloud native
deployments. Networking primitives, including load balancing, observability,
authentication, authorization, policy, rate limiting, QoS, mesh networks, legacy
infrastructure bridging, and so on are now receiving substantial development and
investment throughout the industry and are the subject of focus of the CNCF SIG
Network.

See what the CNCF's Service Mesh Working Group has been up to. Join this talk for an intro to the SIG, its charter and a deeper discussion of current cloud native networking topics being advanced in this SIG. Current CNCF projects in-scope: Open Service Mesh, Kuma, Chaos Mesh, Ambassador, CNI, CoreDNS, Envoy, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS, Network Service Mesh.

  <b>Meet the Maintainers: Service Mesh Interface</b>
</a>

<h4 class="date"> November 17, 2020 </h4>
Join the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) and Meshery maintainers for a Meet the Maintainers
office hours. Learn all about Service Mesh Interface and how Meshery is the service
mesh manager to determine the conformance of all service meshes in or out of compliance
with the specification.
