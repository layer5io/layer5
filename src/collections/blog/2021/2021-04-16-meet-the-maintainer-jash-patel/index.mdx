    Jash, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the
    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions but may not
    know the backstory as to who Jash is and how you arrived at your maintainer
    role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made
    you stay?
  </p>

    Back in August 2020, I was looking for an open-source organization. I found
    my friend
    <Link to="/community/members/tanuj-agarwal"> Tanuj </Link> was part of Layer5,
    and I thought of joining it. I jumped onto my first community call, and Whoo!
    It was so smooth. I was delighted to see the overwhelming response of the community.
    I loved the way the community encouraged every newcomer to their first contribution.
    After that, I never looked back. I still remember my first community meeting
    in which I introduced myself, highlighting my interests in React. The response
    was <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote"> Lee </Link> giving an overly positive reaction.

    I can totally relate to how amazing the Layer5 onboarding process is unique!
    Layer5 Projects has many active, open-source projects. You’ve been
    consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently
    focusing on? Psst. Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Jash:</span>
  <p>
    I started contributing to docs and soon dived into Layer5 websites. While I
    have worked on almost all websites, t (a little in some). The next
    generation Layer5 website (built on Gatsby) was the site I worked on the
    longest. We recently launched this new site (it takes a lot to launch a
    website). Currently, I am working on enhancements to the website and on
    Layer5’s upcoming discussion forum. I think, after this, you would already
    know my favorite one.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">

  <p>
    Definitely, winks! Have you worked with any other open source project? How
    does Layer5 compare?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Jash:</span>
  <p>
    I am a part of my college’s open-source organization. I have contributed to
    and also have mentored a few open-source projects there. Open source is
    always fun - it doesn't matter where you do it. The difference I found here
    was the vast and diverse community that was missing there. Also, exposure to
    different technologies was advantageous for me.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span>Ruth:</span>
  <p>
    You know for me, coming to The Next Generation Layer5 Website was done in
    the space of 6 months which is really impressive. How was the team able to
    pull that off?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span>Jash:</span>
  <p>
    It was a pretty big task. Many people have worked on it(At the time of
    launch we had 140 contributors). It started with Tanuj and me, and then got
    many hands to help us and strive towards its completion. I can’t write all
    those names, or else it would take an entire page to note them down. And
    this is what communities are meant for; open source is intended for. It was
    a combined effort, and we worked on almost everything. The team worked on
    Gatsby, GraphQL, SEO, Analytics, and anything related to the website. The
    two mentors <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote"> Lee </Link> and
    <Link to="/community/members/nikhil-ladha"> Nikhil </Link>,
    were quite helpful for the team to bring it through 6 months.

    It’s amazing you are in school and still actively contribute to Layer5, how
    are you able to multitask it?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span> Jash:</span>
  <p>
    I once mentioned that while my exams were going on, I would study the entire
    day, and when I took breaks, I would just open up Github and work on some
    minor issues. If you are interested in it, you will find a way, I would say.
    This is what helped me. One of the advantages of being in such a diverse
    environment is that when you are stuck somewhere, the work doesn't stop,
    some other contributor picks it up, and it goes on.
  </p>

<div class="interviewer">
  <span> Ruth:</span>
  <p>
    I’m really curious, what does being a Layer5 maintainer mean to you? How has
    being a maintainer impacted you?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span> Jash:</span>
  <p>
    I still remember my first pull request being reviewed. And now I am on the
    other side, reviewing requests. Being a maintainer was a rollercoaster of an
    experience to me. You don’t just review PRs and point out changes, but you
    also have to think of fixes for them. The evolution of green to purple is
    the joy every open-source contributor wishes to see. And me being the one
    doing it makes me feel good. Being a maintainer adds responsibility on the
    one hand and gives freedom on the other hand.

    I really picked a lot of points on that! Do you have any advice for
    individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?
  </p>
</div>

<div class="interviewee">
  <span> Jash:</span>
  <p>
    My advice would be to not look for becoming something. I never thought of
    becoming a maintainer. You just enjoy whatever you are doing, and when the
    time comes, you will get it. Being a maintainer is always special, but
    what's more critical is contributing healthily. A maintainer was always a
    contributor first, and it is that experience that sails them through. I have
    already recommended many of my friends and would like to share it with you;
    if you want to learn open source, Layer5 is the place. We, as a community,
    are always excited to have more people on board and learning something new
    from here. I would love to share the stage with you shortly.
