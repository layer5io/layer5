  Hi, I am Piyush Singariya, a short description of me would be “another
  software engineer watching anime”, in the longer version I am a 2021 graduate
  from IIT Roorkee, who loves to watch anime and play video games all day. I
  know both are exactly the same, but it is what it is.
</p>
<p>
  It all started around 22 Feb when I jumped into slack, and after 10 whole days
  messing around the project, I started to get a hold of it. I started
  contributing to mesheryctl and I thought to apply for the GSoC 2021.
</p>
<h2 id="project">Project</h2>
<p>
  My project was to introduce multiple net new features and minor enhancements
  in Meshery and mesheryctl (Meshery’s CLI).
</p>
<p>
  Meshery is a multi-service mesh management plane that offers lifecycle,
  configuration, and performance management of service meshes and applications
  running on top of those meshes. Meshery uses the{" "}
  <a href="https://smp-spec.io/">Service Mesh Performance</a> specification to
  describe and capture performance benchmarks and characterize service mesh
  behavior.
</p>
<p>
  I integrated many new features in Meshery Some of them are mentioned here.
</p>
<h3 id="mesheryctl">mesheryctl</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Adding a new command to meshery&#39;s cli, i.e. mesheryctl for performance
    profiles and result management
  </li>
  <li>
    Introduction of Unit Testing and Integration testing for Cobra commands of
    cli, mesheryctl.
    <ul>
      <li>Reached 28% code-coverage in mesheryctl</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Introducing health-checks for environment checking of pre/post-deployment of
    meshery server
  </li>
  <li>
    Adding a new command to meshery&#39;s cli, i.e. mesheryctl for managing
    Webssembly filters
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="meshery">Meshery</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Reworking and consolidation of API endpoint handlers</li>
  <li>Swagger Spec definition and automatic publishing of documentation</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="others">Others</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Documentation on writing Unit and Integration Tests and Contributing to
    Meshery Server Documentation
  </li>
  <li>
    CI workflow for Swagger Documentation and running Unit and Integration Tests
    with calculating Code-coverage with CodeCov
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2 id="what-did-i-learn-">What did I learn?</h2>
<p>
  During the whole season, as my work was mostly focused on Golang so I can say
  I learned Golang, learned working around HTTP handlers, writing cobra
  commands, setting up golang unit testing for Cobra Commands(damn, it was
  tough), writing environment health-checks, writing GitHub-actions, Open-API
  specification 2.0,
</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>
  A quick summary of this experience would be that I had a really good time with
  Layer5, I learned, I engaged with other folks in the community, and I believe
  the environment here is truly best for any student to spend their time here,
  to learn and engage with each other. The folks here are crazy for helping new
  members get started with Layer5 projects.
