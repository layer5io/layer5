    Meshery is the open-source, multi-service mesh management plane that can
    provision ten different service meshes, onboard your applications, manage
    WebAssembly filters, apply service mesh patterns, validate against best
    practices, and benchmarks the performance of your service mesh deployments.
    Let’s learn how to manage service meshes with confidence with the multi-mesh
    manager, Meshery.{" "}

<h3>Network Planes</h3>
<img src={Planes} className="slides-right" align="right" alt="network-planes" />
<p>
  As we unfold what a management plane is, it would serve us well to talk about
  network planes in this regard. Architecturally, a service mesh consists of two
  planes. One of those is the data plane, while the other one is the control
  plane. A service mesh data plane is the collection of intelligent proxies that
  operate in unison under the coordination of the control plane. The control
  plane performs configuration management of these intelligent proxies.
</p>
<p>
  A management plane can do many things. Essentially, a management plane helps
  you integrate service meshes into your backend systems. A robust management
  plane allows you to take full advantage of the power of the network while
  integrating your service delivery processes seamlessly. Your management plane
  might federate different types of service meshes, help you instigate chaos
  through controlled experiments, or offer automated traffic splitting in order
  to execute different styles of canarying of your applications. Your management
  plane might offer deep insights into the performance of your applications and
  to the performance of your infrastructure or might deliver a change in
  management framework.

  lifecycle of service meshes. Meshery does workload management, helps you
  onboard or offboard your applications onto the mesh. It also lets you do
  performance management.{" "}

  , performs discovery of existing service meshes and deep fingerprinting of the
  specific functions that version of your service mesh is capable of performing.
  Through MeshSync, Meshery supports brownfield deployments of your service meshes

  not){" "}

<p>
  In order to facilitate such a deep level of understanding of each type of
  service mesh, <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> has
  adapters that are specific to each service mesh (given that each service mesh
  has its own set of features). Consequently, in order to leverage the maximum
  functionality of each service mesh, Meshery has separate, dedicated adapter

  <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> also lets you
  integrate your Prometheus and Grafana add-ons so you can import your existing
  Grafana dashboards to Meshery. When you first start Meshery, we also have a
  configuration wizard, which basically walks you through the entire setup to
  get Meshery up and running. By the end of this, it will make sure that you
  have Meshery running on your cluster.
</p>

<p>
  If you want a more finer configuration, you can configure your environment
  through settings and you can configure service meshes, and you can configure
  the metrics, you can define your performance tests to be reused.
</p>
<p>
  For configuration management,{" "}
  <Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> will analyze your
  runtime environment for certain service meshes and tell you if you're doing
  things right or not. What you can do is you can upload your applications
  directly into Meshery, edit them in the Meshery UI itself and actually apply
  these applications or onboard these applications on your service mesh.

  is a custom controller called MeshSync. MeshSync helps keep Meshery apprised
  of the various changes that are going on to the service meshes and various
  changes that are happening within Kubernetes itself. In this way Meshery
  supports not only greenfield deployments like deploying service meshes itself,
  it also supports connecting to existing service mesh deployments, that is,
  brownfield deployment. So it will discover your existing deployments as well.
</p>
<p>
  There's an extensible concept in Meshery called a{" "}
  <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers">provider</a>.
  Providers can typically offer a layer of persistence so to the extent that
  users are running performance tests intensely or to the extent that users want
  to have a particular type of directory integrated to bring their own identity
  to Meshery and have a multi-user experience. The other area of extensibility
  is the notion that Meshery has a couple of APIs both – rest API and graphql
  API. It comes with a command-line interface as well as a user interface.{" "}
</p>

<h3>Layer5 MeshMap</h3>
<p>
  Another capability of Meshery that is going to be released in the upcoming
  version is visually configuring your service mesh using MeshMap. You can add
  filters, applications as well as make other configurations visually here and
  you can export it as patterns to make it reusable quite easily. It
  automatically figures out the sample application we have deployed, then
  generates a visual representation. It provides users the ability to design
  service meshes, service mesh configuration, and the applications that run on
  it.

    style="padding-bottom:5px;padding-top:auto;"
  />{" "}
  Patterns
</h3>
<p>
  {" "}
  A pattern is capable of describing the deployment of any of the meshes that Meshery
  supports as well as the configuration of the mesh. It also notes ongoing behavior
  so if you wanted to run a canary you can describe that in a pattern. So, patterns
  are like a template, they're customizable and ingestible into Meshery itself.
</p>
<img
  src={ServiceMeshPatterns}
  className="slides-right"
  align="right"
  alt="Service-Mesh-Patterns"
/>
<p>
  Meshery will take action based on what you've described in the pattern, things
  like generating or running a performance test, generating load, and then doing
  statistical analysis on that set of results. In the future, if you want to
  deploy a web assembly filter, you can describe that in a pattern as well and
  have Meshery apply it. The patterns are service mesh agnostic, they're
  reusable and the initial set of them is being stored in a public-facing
  repository. There are almost 60 patterns that have been identified.
  Ultimately, it will allow you to ingest these and measure then orchestrate and
  apply them to your infrastructure. You can also use Meshery to visually
  represent them and to visually design.

  Nighthawk
</h3>
<p>
  There’s a project called <Link to="/projects/nighthawk">Nighthawk</Link> that
  helps advance the existing integration of nighthawk and Meshery. Nighthawk is
  a load generator that is an envoy project. It's written in c plus plus and has
  a couple of intriguing capabilities that are the ongoing study within
  Nighthawk. There is an ongoing effort to take advantage of nighthawk’s
  adaptive load controllers, add a couple of those in and expose them through
  Meshery to let people recursively evaluate what is ultimately an optimal
  configuration in your environment and the service mesh.
</p>

<p>
  If you consider that you've got a certain SLO or a certain minimum latency
  requirement that you need to stick to that but you also want to at the same
  time maximize resiliency characteristics of your deployment, that can be a
  difficult thing to figure out particularly if any of your infrastructure
  changes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you add another node to your environment, your clusters,</li>
  <li>if you upgrade your service mesh,</li>
  <li>if you change the configuration of your service mesh,</li>
  <li>
    if you add another service to your set of workloads that you're running.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  If these factors change, so does the ability to run optimization routines. To
  help you identify the optimal configuration of your mesh but in accordance
  with your own constraints is again the study of{" "}
