Welcome to another exciting edition of Feature Friday Bulletin, where we unveil the latest enhancements to Meshery, your go-to service mesh management tool. This week, we're thrilled to announce a groundbreaking collaboration between Layer5 and Intel, bringing you a suite of service mesh management features tailored for WebAssembly-based network traffic management filters in Envoy, the sidecar proxy used in the data plane of Istio. These new features open up a world of possibilities for your service mesh architecture.

## Seamless WASM Envoy Filter Management

With this collaboration, we're introducing powerful features that simplify the management of Envoy WASM filters via Meshery:

### Meshery UI and CLI Integration
- **Import WASM Envoy Filters**: Easily import your WebAssembly Envoy filters into Meshery using the intuitive UI or the command-line interface ([CLI](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl#data-plane-intelligence)).
- **Publish and Clone Filters**: Share your filters with the community by publishing them in the [Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) and make it effortless for others to clone them.
- **Download WASM Binaries**: Access and download WebAssembly binaries directly from [Meshery Cloud](https://meshery.layer5.io/).
- **Efficient Data Plane Design**: Seamlessly design and deploy Istio and Envoy data planes using [MeshMap](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshmap).
- **Contribute to Open Source**: Get involved with the service mesh community by contributing to any of the 7 open-source [wasm-filters](https://github.com/layer5io/wasm-filters) developed by Layer5.

### Collaboration and Engagement
- :star2: **Support Your Favorites**: Encourage collaboration by starring your [favorite repository](https://github.com/meshery/meshery) on GitHub.
- :playground_slide: **Hands-On Experience**: Experience these features firsthand in the [Meshery Playground](https://playground.meshery.io/) by accessing version v0.6.109.
