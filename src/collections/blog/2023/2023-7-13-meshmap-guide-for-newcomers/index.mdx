<h2>What is MeshMap?</h2>
<p> MeshMap specifically provides a way to visualize and understand how different services interact within a service mesh.It creates a graphical representation of the connections between different services and how data flows between them.</p>

<h2>Why MeshMap?</h2> 

<p>Before we delve into the details, let's explore the benefits of using MeshMap</p>

<ol>
 <p><li><h4>Visualization</h4>MeshMap provides a visual representation of your Kubernetes and service mesh deployments,  helping you understand the architecture, relationships, and patterns between different components of your deployment.</li></p>
 
 <p><li><h4>Design and Configuration</h4>With MeshMap, you can design and configure your cloud-native deployments using an intuitive graphical interface.Drag and drop your cloud-native infrastructure using a palette of thousands of versioned Kubernetes components. </li></p>
 
 <p><li><h4>Deployment Management</h4>MeshMap enables you to deploy your configured deployments into your environment. It assists with the deployment process by ensuring that the configured services, routes, and settings are accurately implemented in your Kubernetes and service mesh environment.</li> </p>
 
 <p><li><h4>Best Practice Patterns</h4>MeshMap offers a catalog of best practice cloud-native patterns. These patterns provide predefined templates and guidelines based on industry best practices, helping you to design and deploy your applications more efficiently and effectively</li></p>
</ol>

<h2>Publishing your first Design!!</h2>

<p>MeshMap works with your Kubernetes clusters so that you design and manage your infrastructure and applications between members of your team. MeshMap has two modes: Designer and Visualizer. Create and share your own Kubernetes deployments and patterns in MeshMap Designer. Deploy your designs and manage your infrastructure using MeshMap Visualizer.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Login to your <a href="https://playground.meshery.io">Playground Account</a></strong></p>
<p>MeshMap is one of meshery cloud extensions available on the sidebar. Click on Meshmap</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:Name your design </strong></p>
<p>Next, let's name your design and switch to components tab to drag-and-drop deployments and patterns</p>
