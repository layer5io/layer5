Yesterday, [HashiCorp announced a change in their source code license](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/10/2723189/0/en/HashiCorp-adopts-the-Business-Source-License-for-future-releases-of-its-products.html) from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) v1.1, effective in all future releases of HashiCorp’s core products, including Terraform, Vault, Consul, Boundary, Nomad, Waypoint, Packer, and Vagrant. HashiCorp APIs, SDKs, and with almost all other libraries remaining MPLv2.

[HashiCorp and Layer5 partnered](/company/news/layer5-hashicorp-launch-service-mesh-partnership) early at the start of Layer5 and continues to be a technology partner. Layer5's projects and products are unaffected by HashiCorp relicensing their software yesterday. Layer5 stands with the open source community and with source-available HashiCorp. 


Layer5's sprawling [portfolio of projects](/projects) [are open source](/blog/community/meshery-surpasses-1000-contributors), pervasively using the Apache 2.0 license. Layer5 is a [community-first organization](/company/about).

Under an open core model, we look forward to continuing to serve our customers with opeen source and our amazing, fast-growing [community](/community) at the center of our focus.
