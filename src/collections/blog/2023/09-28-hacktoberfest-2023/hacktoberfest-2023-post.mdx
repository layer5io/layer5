As the leaves begin to turn and the air grows crisp, it can only mean one thing: [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) is here! This annual celebration of open source, hosted by DigitalOcean, invites contributors from all over the world to participate in a month-long extravaganza of code contributions.

While the allure of limited-edition swag may be enticing, it's essential to approach Hacktoberfest with a mindset focused on quality, respect for maintainers, and a commitment to long-term community engagement.

Layer5 has a long history of participating in Hacktoberfest. 2023 is no different. Our annual [Hacktoberfest kickoff and prep event](/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects) (be sure to join) is tomorrow.

### 1. Purposeful Participation: Beyond Swag Chasing and Profile Building

Before you embark on your Hacktoberfest journey, take a moment to reflect on your motivation. Are you here solely for the swag, just for the green boxes in your GitHub profile, or do you genuinely want to make a meaningful contribution to a project, learn, grow, and make new friends in the process?

Embrace the opportunity to forge lasting connections and dive deeper into topics that resonate with you.

---

### 2. Quality Over Quantity: Making a Lasting Impact

While a flurry of pull requests may be impressive, maintainers value contributions that add genuine value.

Think beyond code and consider how your unique skills—whether in design, organization, or other areas—can enrich the project. Open source thrives on meaningful contributions, so aim to make a tangible difference rather than settling for mediocrity.

### 3. Guidelines Aren't Optional: Respecting the Playbook

That CONTRIBUTING.md file? It's not there for decoration. Treat it as your playbook, providing guidance for equitable collaboration.

Ignoring these guidelines is akin to rearranging someone's furniture without permission. Established protocols are crucial, especially in projects with numerous contributors.

As an example, there is a full set of contributing docs written for Meshery — one for each component:

- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-gitflow">Contributing to Meshery using Git</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/meshery-windows">Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release">Contributing to Meshery Build and Release (CI)</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cypress">End-to-End Tests using Cypress</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-adapters">Meshery Adapters</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docker-extension">Docker Extension</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-server">Meshery Server</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-models">Meshery Models</a>
- <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-error">MeshKit Compatible Errors</a>

### 4. Upholding a Safe Environment: The Code of Conduct

Respect, collaboration, and kindness are the bedrock of open source. The Code of Conduct is non-negotiable, ensuring a secure and inclusive space for all contributors.

The [Layer5 Community Handbook](/community/handbook) offers an excellent reference for community norms and practices.

---

### 5. Engaging Beyond Code: Fostering Holistic Development

Don’t confine yourself to a GitHub profile. Engage in meaningful discussions, participate in webinars, and [open discussions](https://discuss.layer5.io).

Open source offers a wealth of opportunities for comprehensive growth.

---

### 6. Compassion Over Code: Recognizing Maintainer Burnout

<Link to="/community/handbook/repository-overview">Maintainers</Link> are the unsung heroes of the open-source world, often overwhelmed by the Hacktoberfest influx.

Start with issues tagged **good first issue** or **help wanted**.

---

### 7. The Virtue of Patience: Embracing the Long Game

Open source is a marathon, not a sprint. Feedback may take time. Patience is essential.

---

### 8. Humility and Gratitude: The Essence of Meaningful Contributions

Remember, a meaningful contribution is its own reward. Swag and profile boosts are bonuses — not the goal.

---

### 9. Earn a Badge

Earn a Hacktoberfest Contributor badge by contributing to Layer5 projects.
