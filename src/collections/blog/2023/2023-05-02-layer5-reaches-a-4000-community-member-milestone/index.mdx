The Layer5 open source community has reached a milestone that deserves to be celebrated: we're now 4,000 members and growing. Layer5 is an open source community that stewards a number of projects spanning five GitHub organizations and over 80 repositories. Two of the community's projects have even been accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a testament to the quality of work that the members produce.

What makes the Layer5 community truly special, however, is not just its impressive technical achievements, but the warmth and welcoming atmosphere that it provides for its members. This is a community that is passionate about collaboration, inclusivity, and supporting each other to reach new heights.


Members of the Layer5 community come from all backgrounds and levels of experience, and everyone is encouraged to get involved, share their ideas, and contribute to the projects that they are interested in. The community is always open to new members, and there are plenty of resources available for those who are just starting out or looking to expand their skills.

<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the Layer5 community is how supportive it is of its members. Whether you are a newcomer or a seasoned veteran, you will find that people are always willing to lend a hand, offer advice, or just provide a friendly ear when you need it.

This culture of support and collaboration has not gone unnoticed by the wider tech community. Layer5's Meshery project, for example, has been recognized as the #1 most popular Linux Foundation Internship (LFX internship). This is a testament to the quality of work that the community produces, but it's also a reflection of the supportive and inclusive environment that it provides for its members.
