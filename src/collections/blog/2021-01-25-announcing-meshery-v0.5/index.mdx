<p style="color:#3c494f;text-align:center;">Thanks to our open source contributors</p>

We're pleased to announce the release of Meshery 0.5.0, our first release of 2021! This release consists of number of significant architectural enhancements and 8 new capabilities are entering alpha.

The 0.5.0 release cycle will good begin for 2021 release cycle, this is one of the most feature dense releases in a while the Meshery innovation
cycle is still trending upward. This release has many new capabilities,showing that there is still much to explore in the open service mesh ecosystem.


## Major themes

The two new adapters with the latest version of Meshery released

* Meshery Adapter for <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-traefik-mesh">Traefik Mesh (beta)</a>
  * We support Traefik mesh lifecycle management and sample applications operations below
    * Bookinfo, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#bookinfo">BookInfo Document</a>
    * HttpBin, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#httpbin">HttpBin Document</a>

* Meshery Adapter for <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-nginx-sm">NGINX SM Mesh (beta)</a>
  * We support NGINX SM mesh lifecycle management and sample applications operations below
    * Bookinfo, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#bookinfo">BookInfo Document</a>
    * HttpBin, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#httpbin">HttpBin Document</a>
    * Emojivoto, see the <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/guides/sample-apps#emoji.voto">Emojivoto Document</a>
    * Nginx Service Mesh Books, see the <a href="https://github.com/BuoyantIO/booksapp">Nginx Service Mesh Books Document</a>

* Dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions
  * Designed to be pluggable
    * Pluggable UI functionality
    * Pluggable Backend functionality
    * Pluggable AuthZ
  * Offering points of extension to users/integrations to deliver enhanced functionality
    * Authentication and Authorization
    * Long-Term Persistence
    * Enhanced Visualization
    * Reporting
  * Two types of providers are designed in Meshery
    * Local provider
      * Built into Meshery
    * Remote provider
      * It can be implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery


### MeshKit

* <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshkit">MeshKit toolkit</a> aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, 
it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.
* MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.
* The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.


### Meshery Adapter library

* <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-adapter-library">Meshery Adapter Library</a> provides a common and consistent set of functionality
for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.
* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server 
that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.
* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface,
this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.


### MeshSync

* MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator.
* We released it to a new project, welcome to contribute <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshsync">MeshSync</a>
* It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; 
maintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.
* These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.


### Meshery Operator

* We add new broker to meshery-operator <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator/pull/97">PR #97</a>
* We split the source code of MeshSync from Meshery Operator  <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator/issues/88"> issue #88</a>
* Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service-mesh discovery and data streaming via NATS.

### GraphQL

* We added <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture#meshery-operator-and-meshsync">GraphQL instances</a> between Meshery UI and Meshery Server 
to gives UI the power to ask for exactly what they need from mesh stage cache and preparing for more exciting features.


### Meshery Databases

* <a href="https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database">Meshery databases</a> as repositories for MeshSync, user preferences, system settings, 
can be considered ephemeral and treated as caches. Now we have been supported several kinds of databases for different use cases.
