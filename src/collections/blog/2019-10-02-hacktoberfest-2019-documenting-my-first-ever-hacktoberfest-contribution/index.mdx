In [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/), I identified three GitHub issues to kick off my participation in Hacktoberfest 2019. Today, I am happy to showcase my resolution of one of those issues, marking my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution!

#### [Layer5.io](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5)

Before I continue on, I want to acknowledge the project that I have contributed to. In [an article](https://layer5.io/gsoc/2019) discussing their participating in the Google Summer of Code 2019 program, [**Layer5**](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5) is described as a community which represents "the largest collection of _service mesh_ projects and their maintainers in the world". [RedHat.com](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh) helpfully defines a service mesh as "a dedicated infrastructure layer" of an application that controls how different parts of that application ("services") share data with one another (i.e. 'mesh together').

### Selecting my first Hacktoberfest issue

As I mentioned my last post, I came into contact with Layer5 after discovering (through the [Hacktoberfest Issue Finder](https://hacktoberfest-finder.netlify.com/)) its [issue regarding table filtering](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)—and subsequently discovered an unreported styling issue. [![A styling issue with a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's Landscape page.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.png)

A styling issue affected a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).

Of the three GitHub issues I've scoped out, the resolution of this styling issue (i.e. tweaking CSS) represents the simplest of tasks that I have lined up—and an ideal candidate for a first-time Hacktoberfest contribution!

As far as I could tell, no open issues concerned the styling problem that I discovered. So, as instructed both Layer5's website (and encouraged its extremely-welcoming development team), I opened _my own issue_ - [Enhance landscape categories section wrapping (#191)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191).

[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.png?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.png?w=1024)

### Identifying a solution

To address this issue, I came up with the idea of realigning the category list items horizontally, transforming the poorly-behaving columns of category 'cards' into rows in a responsive and easily-scalable vertical stack.

Implementating this idea proved quite simple, requiring only [a few added CSS rules](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508), which I first accomplished by tinkering with the live webpage's styling (with the help of the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) browser extension):


```css
.card .card-content li {
  float: right;
  width: 200px;
}
.card .card-content {
  border-right: unset;
  padding: 0 0 5px 0;
}
.card .card-content:not(:last-child) {
  border-bottom-width: 1px;
  border-bottom-style: dashed;
  border-bottom-color: var(--main-dark-grey);
}
```

The vertical stack is implemented by the rules in the first selector: list items are floated right and assigned a fixed width, which aligns them neatly. The dashed borders and padding used to separate category lists was also adjusted to accomodate the new design (pictured below):

[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.png)

The above image is one of the [two mockups of the redesign](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508) that I produced for the consideration of the project's developers. As luck would have it, Layer5 project lead [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote) provided [a lightning-quick response](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179), welcoming a pull request to it!

#### Future research area: Materialize CSS

I discovered that the 'cards' comprising the category section are styled using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/). I considered using this framework in my solution, but ultimately decided to opt for a simple, intuitive solution. This framework appears interesting, and would definitely merits research were this a more-involved styling task.

## Implementing the solution

While using my browser's developer tools to tinker with styling, I discovered an inline `style` tag that serviced the categories section. I determined that this tag would present the best place to add the styling rules that I wrote (following the coding style of a prior contributor).

Finding the location of this `style` tag (i.e. of the "Service Mesh Landscape" page) in the source code was a lot more trouble than I thought it would be. After paging through too many HTML documents, I gave in and used Visual Studio's global search functionality to locate it.

## Testing the solution

Although I knew that my styling worked well when loaded from a browser extension, before I could contribute code, I needed to ensure that the styling worked equally-well when loaded inline from an HTML document. Little did I know, at that time, what I would be getting myself into...

#### Ruby, Gems and Jekyll? `rvm`, `bundle` and `make`?

Picking through my ~/.bash\_history file, here is the sequence of Bash shell commands that I issued (via WSL Ubuntu) in order to execute a local copy of the layer5 website (annotated for your convenience):
```sh
## Install dependency packages ##
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common

## Install specific version of Ruby via Ruby Version Manager ##
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rvm
rvm install "ruby-2.6.3" # install specific version of Ruby specified in Layer5's Gemfile
                         # (Yes, it must be that exact version.)

## Configure RubyGems ##
echo 'export GEM\_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

## Install Jekyll and dependencies ##
gem install jekyll bundler
bundle install           # install dependencies listed in Gemfile

## Execute project! ##
make site                # references Layer5's Makefile
                         # alias for "bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload"
```
#### Stray thoughts on documentation

Reflecting back on the process, a question has stuck with me: how much should projects hold the hands of novice contributors? Setting up the means to run `make site` is not included within Layer5's [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). As such, for the most novice of contributors, like myself (who have never even heard of `make` before), setting up the prerequisite development environment presented a lengthy and piecemeal (albeit ultimately valuable) learning experience.

How much documentation is too little? Too much? How high should the bar be set for contribution? I suppose it is up to the project's community to decide upon the answers to these questions themselves (and write documentation, accordingly).

## Creating a pull request

After successfully testing and fixing the styling on my local fork, I created [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192):

[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.png?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.png?w=1024)

Pull request – [Restyle landscape categories (#192)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192)

...and it got merged! First Hacktoberfest contribution, completed!

## Up next!

I ended [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) by stating that I have yet to gain any experience with makefiles. Well, thanks to my work on Layer5, that is no longer true: I have since used a makefile (to launch a Jekyll executable)! This experience will undoubtedly save me some time with resolving [the Comcast issue I found](https://github.com/Comcast/RestfulHttpsProxy/issues/5)! However, the next Hacktoberfest issue I resolve will be [_the first one I blogged about_](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65).

Stay tuned!
