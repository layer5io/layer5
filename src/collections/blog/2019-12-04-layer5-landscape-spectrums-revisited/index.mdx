<BlogWrapper>

Several weeks ago, I wrote [a blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/11/15/introducing-comparative-spectrums-to-the-layer5-landscape/) about introducing "comparative spectrum" tools to [the Layer5 landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape)â€”a webpage which I have transformed multiple times, now!

Up until now, the contents of each blog post I have written were centered upon a freshly-opened pull request. Shortly before writing my last post, I did open [one such pull request (layer5#238)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238). However, since my PR remains open, and since I am still working on the same issue my PR addresses, I have opted to instead push [a new commit](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/commits/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495) to the aformentioned (but, now, renamed) PR instead of creating a whole new one. This newest commit introduces a major step towards resolving the issue at hand, and will be the subject of this blog post!

The issue at hand: [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211) - add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page

_**Note:** this blog post will frequently reference [the update and documentation comment that I made](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644) to accompany my last commit to my PR. I consider this hefty comment to be an extension of this blog post, so I strongly recommend giving it a read!_

My initial commit towards introducing comparative spectrum tooling did not represent a full solution. Thinking about what might constitute a full solution for the issue at hand, I came up with three criteria:

## What was still needed:

#### 1\. A complete toolset

Within [Issue #211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211), Layer5 lead developer Lee indicates [four slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6) upon which comparative spectrum graphics may be based upon. During my initial commit, I created graphics that emulated those found within the first three of those four slides, but I had yet to implement the graphic found in [the fourth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12): a table. I was also less-than-satisfied with the 'grid' design I had implemented in response to [slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p10).

#### 2\. A modular design

The designs I am implementing are meant to be used to present opinionated information. As I am not nearly knowledgeable to form opinionated comparisons between service meshes and related technologies, I have instead made my goal to make it as easy as possible for other Layer5 contributors to utilize the graphics ("\[comparative\] spectrums") that I am designing. Doing so would require encapsulating (templating) the spectrums I design (new and old), within their own HTML files, and providing a means to easily invoke (and customize) instances of those templates into the Landscape page.

#### 3\. Documentation

Because the templates I design are intended to be implemented and customized by other contributors, it is _especially_ critical that those contributors have access to complete and thorough documentation detailing the intended use of each templated design.

* * *

## What I delivered:

#### 1\. A complete toolset

As documented in my [update comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644), I designed a table that very closely resembles that of Lee's slides. Implementing the table was interesting, as it ended up requiring [quite a few nested Liquid for-loops](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495/_includes/partials/spectrum/table.html#L23). Also as documented, I revamped the grid-based tooling and am quite pleased with the improvements made. The end result of these efforts is a complete set of comparative spectrums.

#### 2, 3. A modular design and documentation

The bulk of the documentation I wrote details how to deal with the modular solution that I designed and implemented to enable comparative spectrums to be included into the Landscape page (through the use of Liquid `include` tags). The documentation speaks for itself; [check it out!](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644)

## What's next?

I would not have considered the documentation I delivered to be complete if I did not report on the issues still present in the work I delivered. I denoted these as 'Current issues' in the documentation, and they represent work that still remains to be done. I know that I can count on the Layer5 community to assist me with small issues like these, and, once this pull request receives some forward motion, I hope to start zeroing in on its smaller issues. Fortunately, I have made plans to continue working with open source well into the new year!
