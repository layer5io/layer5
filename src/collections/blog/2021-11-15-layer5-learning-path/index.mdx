<h1>Introducing Layer5 Learning Paths</h1>
<p>After five months of community-based development, the Layer5 <a href="https://layer5.io/learn/learning-paths">Learning Paths</a> project, is officially launched! Exciting as it sounds, in addition to the existing free <a href="https://layer5.io/learn">service mesh training resources</a> available to you, Layer5 Learning Paths offer curated guides to assist you in developing your general cloud native networking knowledge and service mesh-specific skills.
</p>

<p>The Learning Path is an initiative developed to help enlighten and test your knowledge on service meshes and management of the workloads that you’ll build atop of them. As a light Learning Management System, Layer5 Learning Paths offer cloud native training and certification through the lens of role-based paths with interactive labs intertwined through the chapters. Oriented around your role as a developer, operator, or security engineer, you can choose your learning path most relevant to your everyday focus.
</p>

<p>Learning Paths comprise courses that are hand-curated by the maintainers at Layer5 and equip you with the foundational tools like <a href="https://meshery.io/">Meshery</a> that assists you in comprehending service mesh concepts. <a href="https://layer5.io/learn/learning-paths/mastering-service-meshes-for-developers">Mastering Service Meshes For Developers</a> is the initial Learning Path offering that focuses on Developers and what you need to know to successfully design workloads for a service mesh environment.

<p>The Layer5 <a href="https://layer5.io/community">community</a> believes that the growth of an individual user and contributor will impact the community’s development as a whole. That is why these courses are all carefully selected to help you learn service mesh the right way from experts on Service Meshes in Layer5. This Learning Path/Certification course is designed to take a developer from a novice in service mesh to becoming an advanced Service Mesh Practitioner.</p>

<h3>Learning Paths information architecture</h3>

<p> Since this is the first phase of the Learning Path/Certification project, only
  one learning path is currently available: Mastering Service Meshes For
  Developers, which is two courses in length with ~8 chapters per course. The
  courses in this learning path focus on the fundamentals of Service Meshes and
  use <a href="https://meshery.io/">Meshery</a> as the management plane to manage the service meshes. It comprises a hands-on tutorial on <a href="https://layer5.io/learn/learning-paths/mastering-service-meshes-for-developers/introduction-to-service-meshes">introduction to Service Meshes</a> and an <a href="https://layer5.io/learn/learning-paths/mastering-service-meshes-for-developers/advance-concepts-of-service-mesh"> introduction to the advanced concepts of Service Meshes</a>. Within each course, you will find
  eight to nine chapters simplified to help developers understand Service Meshes
  & its concepts, installing Meshery, deploying applications, and managing
  service meshes using Meshery.

<p>
  There are also options that permit users to switch between the service mesh
  they wish to learn in each learning path. That is to say, users can understand
  and master the concepts of different service meshes individually under one
  learning path.

<p>
  Phase two and three of the Learning Path/Certification will focus on the
  user’s details to help track progress on each learning path. There will be
  multiple learning paths, interactive labs, & quizzes that test the knowledge
  of participants and award them with a certificate upon the completion of a
  learning path. Maintainers and contributors are working towards implementing
  some of these features in future releases of learning paths. Some of the core
  features to expect are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Multiple Learning Paths.</li>
  <li>User Account</li>
  <li>Bookmarking / Progression tracking</li>
  <li>Quizzes and grades</li>
  <li>Certificate of Completion</li>
</ul>

<h3>What’s next?</h3>
<p>
  The Layer5 maintainers and contributors are improving the Learning path’s
  features and increasing the number of courses and learning paths. While all
  that is still in motion, these courses are now available on the <Link to="/learn/learning-paths">Layer5 site</Link>.
  Feel free to take these courses and try out the hands-on tutorials provided.
  If you encounter any bugs while taking these courses, kindly report by
  creating an issue; you can also join the <a href="https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/C015QJKUMPU">#Website</a> Slack channel if you have
  any questions or wish to contribute to this project.
