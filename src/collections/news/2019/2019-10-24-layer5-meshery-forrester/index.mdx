Distributed systems are hard to do well, and microservices are even harder. As an important step toward enabling mainstream developers to be successful, service mesh technology has carved out a place in the microservices landscape. There’s a lot of dust covering the service mesh landscape, and there are more enterprises trying one out than using one in production, but sooner or later, you’ll need a service mesh for your microservices platform. In this webinar, Forrester lays out what a service mesh can and cannot do, walks through the developing technology, and sets a foundation for planning when and how to use a service mesh.

<strong>Key takeaways:</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Learn the purpose, major functions, and structure of a service mesh.</li>
    <li>Understand how the diverse service mesh technology space is developing</li>
    <li>Identify the major factors that influence how your organization should use a service mesh.</li>
