[Salt Lake City, UT] [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon] - November 14th, 2024 – <Link to="/">Layer5</Link>, the open source company behind the popular <a href="https://meshery.io">Meshery</a> project, announces Kanvas, a new collaboration platform that is like Google Workspace, but designed for engineering teams.
</p>

<a href={KanvasScreenshot}><img src={KanvasScreenshot} alt="Layer5 Kanvas Designer" width="100%" className="block-display align-center" /></a>

<p><a href="https://kanvas.new/">Kanvas</a> is a multi-modal collaboration suite built atop one of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s highest velocity open source projects: Meshery. Kanvas’s two modes, Designer and Operator, offer declarative and imperative DevOps workflows, respectively. Both modes provide a visual interface for creating and managing complex cloud native infrastructure, expediting collaborative problem-solving, brainstorming and innovation, engineer onboarding, and auto-documented infrastructure. Importantly, Kanvas helps teams avoid finger-pointing and the blame-game by allowing them to be on the same page - literally.</p>

  quote="Partnering on Dapr’s integration with Meshery has been eye-opening. Kanvas promotes collaboration in the design and discussion of cloud native applications, eliminating misunderstandings between teams. It is a game-changer for how we navigate the complexities of relationships between system components"

<p>
As an extensible, self-service engineering platform with hundreds of technology integrations, supporting multi-cloud and Kubernetes native infrastructure, Meshery is the ideal management platform upon which to build Kanvas’ novel collaboration experience. Meshery has thousands of pre-built components supporting Kubernetes and Cloud services and with over 2,000 contributors, Meshery is the 9th fastest growing CNCF (out of 200+ projects).

  quote="Internal developer platforms, like Meshery, are rising in popularity, because engineering teams remain siloed with disparate tooling, inconsistent workflow, lack of collaboration and shared process. A lack of collaboration plagues engineering teams with 83% of IT organizations implementing DevOps practices. 62% of organizations are stuck mid-DevOps evolution, teams tightly coupled and responsibilities diffused. Engineering teams desperately need to collaborate, but lack tooling specifically designed for cloud native infrastructure."

<p>
Like Figma for engineers, Kanvas users can access Kanvas from any computer with an internet connection and a web browser.
</p>

#### Feature Highlights:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Infrastructure as Design</strong>: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for designing and visualizing cloud native infrastructure and general architecture diagrams. Supports Kubernetes and multi-cloud services.</li>
  <li><strong>Self-Service DevOps</strong>: Empowers engineers to create, share, and manage their own environments on demand.</li>
  <li><strong>Greenfields and Brownfield Infrastructure</strong>: Import existing cloud environments to visualize current infrastructure or create a new design from scratch.</li>
  <li><strong>GitOps Integration</strong>: Pull request integration for infrastructure design reviews.</li>
  <li><strong>Model-Driven</strong> characterization of both semantic and non-semantic infrastructure as design components.</li>
  <li><strong>Policy-driven intelligent inference</strong> of infrastructure components and their relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Real-Time Collaboration</strong>: Work with others on your designs in real-time, making it easier to collaborate and share ideas, while all changes are saved automatically. </li>
  <li><strong>Design Patterns</strong>: A catalog full of ready-made blueprints for common infrastructure and application architectures.</li>
  <li><strong>Kanvas Spaces</strong>: provide a collaborative environment similar to Google Shared Drive, but specifically tailored for cloud-native infrastructure management.</li>
  <li><strong>Design Reviews</strong>: Collaboratively review and provide feedback on designs and prototypes.</li>
</ul>
