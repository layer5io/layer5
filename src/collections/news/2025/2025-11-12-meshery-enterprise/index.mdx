**ATLANTA, GA** — November 12, 2025 — [Layer5](https://layer5.io) today announced the general availability of **Kanvas**, an **enterprise-grade distribution of the open source [Meshery](https://meshery.io)** framework for declaratively managing Kubernetes environments.

Announced at **KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025**, Kanvas extends Meshery with additional graphical tools to visualize and edit infrastructure, including the ability to store **design snapshots in GitHub repositories**. Built on top of Meshery, Kanvas introduces **collaborative workspaces** that enable IT teams to design, share, and manage Kubernetes environments more efficiently. It also provides access to a **catalog of hundreds of pre-built design patterns and reference architectures** that can be customized and extended.

---

## **Enterprise Features and Extensibility**

Kanvas adds **role-based access controls (RBAC)** and supports the import of existing Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize configurations, and Docker Compose files.

Available for deployment by internal IT teams or as a **managed service**, Kanvas provides a **drag-and-drop interface** for designing and visualizing complex infrastructure and application architectures using Meshery.

## **Introducing Kanvas Operator (Beta)**

Layer5 is also making available, in beta, a **Kanvas Operator** for managing live infrastructure in real time. The Operator extends the Meshery framework, which continues to be advanced under the auspices of the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**. This beta release expands Meshery’s capabilities to operational control of live Kubernetes environments.

## **Improving Scalability and Knowledge Retention**

Kanvas simplifies management of Kubernetes clusters at scale and makes it easier to onboard additional engineers. By combining visual design, collaboration, and dry-run validation, Kanvas helps reduce configuration errors and preserve institutional knowledge.

> “As the number of Kubernetes clusters in production continues to increase, the need for tools that simplify configuration and management is becoming more urgent,” Calcote said. “There simply are not enough engineers to manage these clusters, so platforms like Kanvas help smaller teams manage complex environments more consistently.”

Calcote added that while Kubernetes remains one of the most powerful and complex IT platforms, Kanvas and Meshery are designed to make it more accessible to a broader range of IT professionals.

## **Toward Broader Accessibility of Kubernetes**

As Kubernetes adoption grows, many organizations are seeking ways to enable **IT administrators** to handle day-to-day management tasks traditionally performed by **DevOps engineers**. According to Calcote, the goal is not to eliminate DevOps roles, but to **make validated configurations reusable** so IT teams can safely manage environments at scale.

> “In effect, Meshery and Kanvas are making it simpler for IT teams to embrace *infrastructure by design* principles,” Calcote said.

With workloads—especially **AI applications**—continuing to grow, tools like Kanvas that operate at higher levels of abstraction will help organizations better manage Kubernetes environments and focus on application delivery rather than infrastructure complexity.
