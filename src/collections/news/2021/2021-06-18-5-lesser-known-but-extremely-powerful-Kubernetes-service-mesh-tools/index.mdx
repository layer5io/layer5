DevOps teams use the right tools to automate deployment plans to minimize risk to the product and customer experience. These service mesh tools also provide synchronization with web communication standards, adapted to varying security protocols, and offer better management.

## Here are some lesser-known Kubernetes service mesh tools:

**Autopilot:** Autopilot is a toolkit and SDK used for deploying and developing service mesh operators. It is developed by Solo.io, a service connectivity company. This service was launched in late-2019. The service allows its users to automate the service mesh interface for chaos experimentation, adaptive security, canary automation, and more.

**Consul:** Consul, a service mesh solution, has a full-featured control plane. It was first released in 2014 and developed by HashiCorp. This service mesh can be installed and configured on an existing Kubernetes cluster. Its latest version is 1.9.5 that was released on April 15, 2021

**OSM:** Open Service Mesh (OSM) is an open-source service mesh created by Microsoft that supports the Kubernetes environment. It is a cloud-native service mesh that allows users to manage and secure service meshes consistently. It also offers out-of-the-box observability features for dynamic microservice environments.

**Layer5:** Layer5 is a service mesh company and a worldwide community that offers a large collection of service mesh projects. The community creates and maintains several projects that focus on the service mesh-centric capabilities in a cloud-based environment.
The key projects operating under the Layer5 community include: `Meshery`, `Learn Layer5`, `Service Mesh Landscape`, `Image Hub`, `Meshery Operator`, `Service Mesh Interface Conformance`, and `NightHawk`.

**Kuma:** Kuma is an open-source service mesh that provides support for multiple environments across clouds, such as Kubernetes and virtual machines. It was created by Kong, and it was recently added to CNCF as a Sandbox project. Moreover, Kuma is production-ready, and it is still under active development.
