<p>AUSTIN, TEXAS, May 10th, 2022: Layer5, Inc.<sup>®</sup>, a provider of cloud native management software, announced today the general availability of the Meshery Docker Extension. Complementing Docker Desktop's role as the go-to Kubernetes environment for cloud native developers, the Meshery Docker Extension provides easy access to the next layer of cloud native infrastructure: service meshes. As an inaugural Docker Extensions Partner and a maker of industry-defining, cloud native software, Layer5’s integration of Meshery provides a visual pathway for existing Docker Compose applications to move into Kubernetes and onto any service mesh.</p>

<p className="pull-right">From its genesis, Meshery has natively supported Docker as a deployment platform. WIth the Meshery Docker Extension the ability for developers to access a Kubernetes environment complete with a service mesh like Consul, Linkerd, Kuma, Istio, and so on. Meshery's deep support for the Cilium Service Mesh is the project's latest service mesh adapter.</p>

<p>As a <a href="https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-captain-take-5-lee-calcote/">Docker Captain</a>, I have always been a proponent of Docker. Docker Extensions bring an integrated experience with ecosystem tooling, like Meshery - a critical tool for developers, who are configuring and managing cloud native applications.</p>

Importantly, the Meshery Docker Extensions provides these significant features directly to Docker users:

<p><strong>Kubernetes and service mesh support for your Docker Compose apps</strong> - Import your Docker Compose apps. Configure and deploy them to Kubernetes and any service mesh.</p>

<p><strong>Visual design of Kubernetes applications</strong> - Using <Link to="/meshmap">MeshMap</Link> as a visual topology for designing Docker Compose applications, operating Kubernetes, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>

<p><strong>Single-click deployment of any service mesh</strong> - Support of 10 different service meshes to the fingertips of developers in connection with Docker Desktop’s ability to deliver Kubernetes locally.</p>

<p><strong>Detection of Kubernetes environments -</strong> scan your kubeconfigs and select your current Kubernetes environment. Switch from one environment to another one.</p> 

<BlockquoteAlt
  quote="The Meshery Extension transforms Docker Desktop into a powerful load generation utility, conveniently enabling HPE engineers with the ability to deploy and configure any service mesh with a click of the button and invoke and control load-based performance tests from our desktop."
