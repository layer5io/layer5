## **Challenging Established Kubernetes Tools**

Docker Kanvas aims to challenge established solutions like Helm and Kustomize by automating the conversion of Docker Compose files into Kubernetes artefacts. This approach simplifies the transition from local development to cloud production, addressing a common pain point in cloud-native development workflows.

## **Infrastructure as Code with Visualisation**

The platform marks a shift toward Infrastructure as Code (IaC), offering visual representations to simplify cloud-native deployments. By providing visualisations alongside code generation, Kanvas helps developers understand and manage their infrastructure configurations more effectively.

## **Layer5 Collaboration**

Developed in partnership with Layer5, Kanvas leverages the expertise of the cloud-native management platform creator to deliver a comprehensive solution for Kubernetes deployment automation.
