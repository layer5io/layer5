Meshery took its first steps into the Cloud Native world in July of 2019 with the vision to ease the adoption and operation of any service mesh. Since then, Meshery as a project and Layer5 as an open source community has grown by leaps and bounds. Now, right at a year later, we are bursting with pride in announcement of:

<h3 align="center">Meshery is officially accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's Landscape!</h3>

<br/>
Read about our journey in the words of one of our valued contributors and proud Meshery user, Anton Weiss: <br/>
<i>
"Open source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So, if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! <br/> Hop on to Layer5 Slack and we'll happily embrace you and help you get started. And it's not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent."
