        <p>
            We are a fun, talented and driven team dedicated to providing our customers with easy-to-use software and a world-class,
            open source community experience. While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of service mesh
            projects and their maintainers in the world. Advanced and emerging technology, and empowering engineers are at the core
            of our company, and though we move at a very fast pace, we are committed to maintaining a work environment of continual
            learning and giving back to our community. A passion for great design, dedication to innovation and a strong social media
            presence are our building blocks for creating a unique and engaging brand across the cloud native landscape. Our headquarters
            are located in the hill country of Austin, Texas, and we embrace the unique vibe and energy of our hometown as an inspiration
            for our brand and company culture.

        <p>
            The Layer5 Internship Program offers students and graduates an opportunity to gain exposure to the inner workings of the
            fast-moving world of cloud native. We value all of our interns and commit to providing a comprehensive learning experience that
            aligns with individual interests and career goals.
        </p>
        <h3>What You Will Learn</h3>
        <p>
            We have multiple internships open. In this position, you will collaborate with our core team in each stage of the software engineering
            lifecycle. Your work will include designing, coding, testing, and deploying cloud native solutions.
            This is an extremely dynamic position and a great opportunity for an entry level tech person to build their skills and their career.
            The Software Engineer Intern will work closely with the open source community and broad set of Layer5 academic and technology partners.
            The ideal candidate is who enjoys learning at a high rate and is driven to succeed with little supervision. You are someone who works well
            in a team and takes pride in helping a company succeed and grow and are willing to put in the work needed to become a valued member of an
            evolving engineering team.
        </p>
        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
        <p>
            As a Layer5 software engineer intern, you will learn our guiding principles to software architecture and design. You will understand and
            internalize Layer5's vision and strategy for helping the world adopt service meshes; helping the world expect more from their infrastructure.
            Put your software development skills to use with cloud native paradigms and modern software making.
            Interns will enhance their weilding of language-specific idioms, their understanding of distributed systems challenges, and be able to identify
            and avoid anti-patterns. You will understand how to develop cloud native infrastructure management software, and how to empathize with your
            target persona. You will engage with other world-class engineers from Layer5 and partner companies.
