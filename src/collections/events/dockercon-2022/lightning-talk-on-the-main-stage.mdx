HashiCorp’s Consul service mesh offers unique functionality offered to its users. Using its visual designer, MeshMap, Meshery facilitates the developers full understanding of Consul’s differientiated capabilities, allowing developer’s to visually configure and deploy Consul-based deployments and their workloads.

The Meshery extension’s ability to import Docker Compose apps, convert them to Kubernetes applications, and deploy them on Consult service meshes is a powerful enabler for microservices developers, who need to dev, test, and deploy their modern applications in context of and compatibility with Consul service mesh.
