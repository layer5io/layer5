With a goal to bring workload identity and attestation to all service meshes, HPE Security Engineering uses the Docker Desktop Extension for Meshery to deploy their service mesh of choice and test the performance of their SPIFFE and SPIRE-based identity solution.

The Meshery extension transforms Docker Desktop into powerful load generation utility, conveniently enables HPE engineers with the ability to deploy and configure any service mesh with a click of the button and invoke and control load-based performance tests from their desktop.

Canâ€™t wait to get your hands on Docker Desktop for Meshery in the meantime? Sign up for our <Link to="/docker-extension-meshery">beta program</Link> to get early access!
