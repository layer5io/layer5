<Link to="/programs/hacktoberfest">Hacktoberfest</Link> is just around the corner. You'd be surprised to know how small changes can make a big impact on a project. The more a project scales, the easier it is for small errors to live within it. You can make a real difference by fixing these relatively easier issues and continue to grow from there.
