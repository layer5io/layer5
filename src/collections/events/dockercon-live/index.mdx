Too lazy to implement multi-tenancy? Don't have time to implement per user rate limiting in your application's endpoints? In this talk, we will examine how to let application infrastructure concerns melt off your Dockerized workloads and have your infrastructure implement multi-tenancy on your behalf.

Learn how to use Docker Desktop and Kubernetes as your development platforms of choice in combination with Meshery, the service mesh management plane, to easily deploy a service mesh. Using Consul and Envoy's latest capabilities, see how WASM can be used to move user authentication and authorization from your application to the infrastructure.
