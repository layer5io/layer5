Which service mesh should I use and how do I get started? What are the different service meshes, and how do they contrast? 
Learn about the functionality of different service meshes and visually manipulate mesh configuration. This lightning talk introduces Meshery, an open source, multi-service mesh management plane that provisions
(five and counting) different service meshes, their sample applications and how it benchmarks the performance of service mesh deployments. Meshery facilitates benchmarking various configuration scenarios of Istio,
comparison of performance of services (applications) on and off the mesh and across different meshes. It vets mesh and service configurations against deployment best practices. 
Some of the service mesh projects use Meshery as their performance benchmark tool for each release.
