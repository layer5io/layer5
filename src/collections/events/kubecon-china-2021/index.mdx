    Solving the Service Mesh Adopter’s Dilemma
  </a>
</h2>

<p>
  Which service mesh should I use and how do I get started? What are the
  different service meshes, and how do they contrast? Learn about the
  functionality of different service meshes and visually manipulate mesh
  configuration.{" "}
</p>

<p>
  This talk introduces Meshery, an open source, multi-service mesh management
  plane that provisions (ten and counting) different service meshes, their
  sample applications and how it benchmarks the performance of service mesh
  deployments. Meshery facilitates benchmarking various configuration scenarios
  of any service mesh, comparison of performance of services (applications) on
  and off the mesh and across different meshes. It vets mesh and service
  configurations against deployment best practices. Some of the service mesh
  projects use Meshery as their performance benchmark tool for each release.

    CNCF TAG Network and Service Mesh Working Group
  </a>
</h2>

<p>
  With the increasing prevalence of microservice-based distributed systems, this
  is true: the network, as a discipline, has never been so critical in the
  efficient operation of cloud-native deployments. Network primitives including
  load balancing, observability, authentication, authorization, policies, rate
  limiting, QoS, mesh networks, traditional infrastructure bridging, and so on
  are now being developed and invested by the entire industry, and are the focus
  of the Service Mesh Working Group withing the CNCF TAG Network.{" "}

<p>
  Listen to our introduction and get an in-depth understanding of the service
  mesh projects being managed within the working group.
