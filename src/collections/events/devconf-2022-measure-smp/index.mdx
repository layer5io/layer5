<p>

Benchmarking a service mesh and your workloadâ€™s performance is no simple task. Questions arise like:

<ul>
<li>Which load generator should you use and what signals should you measure?</li>
<li>How long should I run a test?</li>
<li>How has the performance of service meshes evolved over time?</li>
<li>Should I run tests from outside or within my cluster?</li>
<li>How does the configuration of my service mesh affect performance?</li>

</ul>

This talk answers these questions by empowering attendees with at-hand tooling for continual evaluation of their service mesh environment and a reflection of how service mesh deployment models affect performance.
