<h3>CNCF Tag Network and Service mesh Working Group Deep Dive</h3>
<p>
With the increasing prevalence of microservice-based distributed systems, this is true: the network, as a discipline, has never been so critical in the efficient operation of cloud-native deployments. Network primitives including load balancing, observability, authentication, authorization, policies, rate limiting, QoS, mesh networks, traditional infrastructure bridging, and so on are now being developed and invested by the entire industry, and are the focus of the Service Mesh Working Group withing the CNCF TAG Network. Listen to our introduction and get an in-depth understanding of the service mesh projects being managed within the working group.
