Join Meshery at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2025, Atlanta, US!


Join the Meshery project at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2025 from November 10th to November 13th, 2025 and get introduced to collaborative cloud native management and Meshery open source maintainers.
### Session: Project Lightning Talk: Beyond YAML: Visualising Kubernetes Ontologies With Meshery

Kubernetes landscape is expansive yet intricate, requiring engineers to navigate sophisticated configurations spanning numerous components and custom resources. This intricacy can become daunting, particularly when dealing with repetitive configuration management duties such as handling YAML files, network setups, and RBAC policies.

Meshery, an open-source cloud-native manager, addresses this by leveraging human-computer interaction principles to simplify Kubernetes. Through Kanvas, an intuitive visual interface, Meshery reduces cognitive load, aligns with users mental models, and streamlines infrastructure design backed by OPA policies. Join this lighting talk to see how Meshery makes Kubernetes more accessible, empowering you to visualize and manage complex relationships across CNCF projects with ease and precision.

### Session: "Do You Even Merge?" - Welcome To Maintainers Life, Please Bring Snacks and Boundaries

Open Source maintainers are often seen as gatekeepers of progress, expected to fix bugs, review PRs, design features, answer questions, and keep the community happy. But behind that façade is often an unexpected reality, especially in high-velocity CNCF projects.

In this talk, we will share what it’s like to maintain a CNCF Graduated project, not just the technical side, but the human side: how we keep the project growing, prioritize responsibly, and how governance structures like SIGs help scale responsibilities. You’ll hear stories, lessons, and hard truths that rarely make it into blog posts.

The more successful a project becomes, the harder it gets to sustain, and that’s something we don’t acknowledge enough. If you’ve ever wondered why your issue didn’t get a response, why a feature was declined, or what “being supportive” really looks like in open source, this talk will help you understand the maintainer’s side and maybe rethink your own role in the ecosystem to support them.

### Session: 🚨 Contribfest: Meshery Contribfest: Dive Deep Into Extending Cloud Native Management

Join us for an in-depth session on Meshery a leading cloud native management plane with Meshery maintainers and community. This is your chance to get hands-on with the tools shaping the future of collaborative cloud native management. We will walk through the Contributing Guide to help you familiarize yourself with the project and the contribution process with opportunities to work on core functionality in the Server (Golang) or UI (React) or extend Meshery by building your own plugin.

Contribute to the documentation by incorporating your own examples of cloud native architectures using Meshery Designer. You will gain experience with cloud native technologies, including essentially every CNCF project and open source development practices. This session will be led by Meshery maintainers and contributors. No Prior Experience Needed: We welcome contributions from all levels of experience. Join us at Meshery Contribfest and be part of the future of collaborative cloud native management.
