### Session: Kubernetes Ontologies with Meshery

<p>
Kubernetes ecosystem is rich yet complex, requiring engineers to handle intricate configurations across multiple components and custom resources. This complexity can be overwhelming, especially with tedious configuration management tasks like managing YAML files, network setups, and RBAC rules. 

Meshery, an open-source cloud-native manager, addresses this by leveraging human-computer interaction principles to simplify Kubernetes. Through Kanvas, an intuitive visual interface, Meshery reduces cognitive load, aligns with users mental models, and streamlines infrastructure design backed by OPA policies. Join this lighting talk to see how Meshery makes Kubernetes more accessible, empowering you to visualize and manage complex relationships across CNCF projects with ease and precision.
