Join Meshery at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe, London, United Kingdom!


Join the Meshery project at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2025 from April 1st to April 4th, 2025 and get introduced to collaborative cloud native management and Meshery open source maintainers.
### Session: Kubernetes Ontologies with Meshery

Kubernetes ecosystem is rich yet complex, requiring engineers to handle intricate configurations across multiple components and custom resources. This complexity can be overwhelming, especially with tedious configuration management tasks like managing YAML files, network setups, and RBAC rules. 

Meshery, an open-source cloud-native manager, addresses this by leveraging human-computer interaction principles to simplify Kubernetes. Through Kanvas, an intuitive visual interface, Meshery reduces cognitive load, aligns with users mental models, and streamlines infrastructure design backed by OPA policies. Join this lighting talk to see how Meshery makes Kubernetes more accessible, empowering you to visualize and manage complex relationships across CNCF projects with ease and precision.
