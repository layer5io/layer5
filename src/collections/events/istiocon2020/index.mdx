Join Layer5 at the inaugural Istio conference on Monday, Feb. 22nd to Friday, Feb. 26th. <a href="https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2021/about/">IstioCon</a> is a 100% virtual event that is designed to connect community members across the globe with Istio and the Istio ecosystem.

Layer5 will kickoff the event with our renowned service mesh workshop, featuring <a href="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</a>, the service mesh manager. Attend our workshop to help you get started with managing your own service mesh!

<h4>Using Istio</h4>
<br />
<p>
As the third phase in your microservices journey, service meshes provide a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility and granular control over service requests. Service meshes have quickly entered the cloud native landscape filling unmet service-level needs. Organizations that have adopted containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5, service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the popular service mesh - Istio. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.
</p>
You will learn to:

<ul>
<li>Configure and operate Istio in context of an example workloads and their common use cases</li>
<li>Manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications</li>
<li>Enforce policies and rate limiting</li>
<li>Be confident with ongoing management of Istio</li>
<li>Understand WebAssembly filters for Envoy and deploy a custom filter</li>
</ul>
