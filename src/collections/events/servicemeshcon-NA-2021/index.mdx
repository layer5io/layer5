<h3>Service Mesh Patterns by the Book</h3>
<p>
  Infrastructure diversity is a reality for many organizations. It’s predicted
  that by 2022, 90% of all apps will feature microservices architectures. A huge
  range of microservice patterns drives a world of multiple service meshes. As
  various service meshes have proliferated infrastructures, service mesh
  patterns and abstractions have emerged. We will break down 60 service mesh
  patterns into different categories of use, demonstrating and examining a
  select few using Meshery for deeper review of their problems they solve,
  discussing caveats, and highlighting anti-patterns.{" "}

<p>
  The patterns discussed are being published in{" "}
  <a href="/books/service-mesh-patterns">Service Mesh Patterns</a> (O’Reilly) by
  Lee Calcote and Nic Jackson.
