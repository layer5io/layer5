Join Layer5 at ServiceMeshCon North America 2021. <a href="https://events.linuxfoundation.org/servicemeshcon-north-america//">ServiceMeshCon</a> is a vendor-neutral conference on service mesh technologies. Topics include getting started with and adopting a mesh, lessons learned from production deployments, and technical sessions from service mesh maintainers.


<h3>Service Mesh Patterns by the Book</h3>
<p>Infrastructure diversity is a reality for many organizations. It’s predicted that by 2022, 90% of all apps will feature microservices architectures. A huge range of microservice patterns drives a world of multiple service meshes. As various service meshes have proliferated infrastructures, service mesh patterns and abstractions have emerged. We will break down 60 service mesh patterns into different categories of use, demonstrating and examining a select few using Meshery for deeper review of their problems they solve, discussing caveats, and highlighting anti-patterns. </p>

<p>The patterns discussed are being published in <a href="/books/service-mesh-patterns">Service Mesh Patterns</a> (O’Reilly) by Lee Calcote and Nic Jackson.</p>
