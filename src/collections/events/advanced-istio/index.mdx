Organizations that have adopted containers and are running a handful (or more) of microservices often find tools to provide observability, control, and security lacking. Service meshes—the third phase in the microservices journey—have quickly entered the cloud native landscape, filling unmet service-level needs and providing a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility, and granular control over service requests. Operating at layer 5, service meshes offer great value.

Lee Calcote walks you through advanced service mesh concepts and each and every aspect of the open source service mesh Istio. Over three hours, you’ll gain hands-on experience with this popular tool as you learn how to deploy Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.

### What you'll learn-and how you can apply it

#### By the end of this live online course, you’ll understand:

- Istio's methods for managing telemetry, monitoring, and reporting
- Advanced traffic management scenarios
- Approaches to canary deployments and securing communication with Istio

#### And you’ll be able to:

- Configure and operate Istio in context of an example workloads and their common use cases
- Manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications
- Enforce policies and rate limiting
- Be confident in the third step of your cloud native journey with ongoing management of your service mesh

### This training course is for you because...

- You’re an operator who wants uniform observability irrespective of the different languages and libraries that run your services.
- You’re a developer who wants to affect application behavior without code changes.
- You want to become a cloud native architect or level up as one.

#### Prerequisites

- A working knowledge of Istio and Kubernetes
- Familiarity with Docker Desktop, Minikube, or kind
- A computer with Docker and Meshery installed locally
- Access to local or remote Kubernetes cluster of any size, with cluster admin privileges (Either of these two local single-node clusters will work: Docker Desktop or Minikube.)

#### Recommended preparation

- Take Introduction to Istio (live online training course with Lee Calcote)
- If you need to brush up on Kubernetes, take Introduction to Kubernetes (live online training course with Sébastien Goasguen) or read Kubernetes Cookbook (book) or Kubernetes: Up and Running (book)

#### Recommended follow-up

- Read The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures (report)
- Read Istio: Up and Running (early release book)
