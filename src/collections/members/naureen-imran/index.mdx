bio: |
  As a full-stack developer with a background in business and finance, I have been seeking a career change that aligns with my passion for technology and community engagement. To pursue this goal, I completed two bootcamps that expanded my skillset and inspired me to contribute to open source projects, specifically Meshery. Through these contributions, I hope to both improve the project and share my experiences with others in the open source community.
