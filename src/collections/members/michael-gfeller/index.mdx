bio: I’ve been working as an infrastructure and software engineer for over 20 years, both as technical architect and developer. It started with IT infrastructure and continued with Java-based enterprise applications. In recent years, my focus shifted to cloud architecture, DevOps and modern software development. In modern distributed architectures, I find services meshes especially fascinating. There, simplicity handles complexity. I started to program around 1980 and have used many programming languages since then. My favorite languages are Clojure and PostScript.
