bio: I have a deep interest in technology and am inherently curious, always eager to learn and work with new technologies. My love for the open-source community stems from the exposure it provides to collaborate with the best minds. As a Full Stack Developer, I find joy in building new products and solving problems to make them useful for users. Additionally, I am keenly interested in the DevOps and cloud-native fields.
