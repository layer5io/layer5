bio: I am an undergrad in Computer Science with inclinations towards Frontend development (Vue, tailwindcss, Laravel php) and Data Science. I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve problems and build robust products. I have grown to relish open source contribution, not only as a means of networking with brilliant professionals and building/improving products with a global reach, but also as a means of spurring my own technical growth. Besides coding, youâ€™d typically find me jamming on my guitar or eating.
