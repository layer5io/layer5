bio: Maxi is a Sofware Engineer who loves to understand the whole picture, from the pixels on the screen to the bits that travel through the wires. Passionate about mentoring young engineers, open-source, cyber security, cloud infrastructure, and solving complex problems with simple solutions (service meshes being one of them!).
 In his free time, Maxi loves to travel abroad as much as time permits, and spend time with his dog Beto and his cat Lola.
