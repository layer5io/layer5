bio: "I'm an undergrad student majoring in Information Technology at NIT Karnataka. My interests in cloud systems, open source, and software development led me to be a part of the Layer5 organization where I have been able to work on projects that align with my interests and contribute to the community. I take great satisfaction in building stuff that is useful to others and Layer5 has enabled me to do so."
