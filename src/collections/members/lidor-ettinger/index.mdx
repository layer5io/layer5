bio: I first became interested in sofware development in my highschool years. I chose a three year path in computer science and quickly discovered it was my specialty. I continued my studies into my college undergraduate degree and was selected for a leadership program. I now have been in the software engineering industry for over four years. As a creative developer I have been involved with expanding infrastructure and operating production enviornments. My specialty is building resilient, robust and innovative solutions. I invest my spare time with the open source community in order to contribute my skills and knowledge.
