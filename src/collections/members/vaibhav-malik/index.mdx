bio: Hi, I am an ardent advocate of open-source initiatives, presently engrossed in the realms of DevOps and Backend development. I have had the privilege of participating as a mentee in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program under the aegis of Inkscape for two consecutive years. Moreover, during the recent summer term, I undertook an internship at Sprinklr, situated in Gurgaon, where I assumed the role of a Product Engineer.
I hold a distinct inclination towards C and C++, considering them as my primary programming preferences. Should you require any assistance in embarking upon open-source contributions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. Your inquiries are most welcome.
