bio: I am a digital product designer passionate about the interaction between humans and technology. I am also a curious, adaptable, and effective person, capable of analyzing and understanding new concepts quickly and applying them when needed. I use my skills to improve user flows in order to help them achieve their objectives and, as much as possible, align them with business goals to ensure an optimized experience and productivity. When I'm not designing and proposing solutions, I enjoy listening to music, watching football and movies, or playing video games.
