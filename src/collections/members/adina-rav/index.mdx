bio: I am in building software industry since 2006, hope to give my devops approach new dimensions and strike in an approachable devops learning path for devolopers, testers, QAs and Ops.
    I am focusing on enabling developers to know more of the underlying systems on which they build, shortening pipelines, automate deployments, improving golang skills, learning service meshes and networking, calibrating software behaviour through performance, provide a better input on strategies and tooling selections when building web apps.
