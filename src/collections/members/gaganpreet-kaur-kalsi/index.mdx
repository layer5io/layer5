bio: " I am a Front-End developer whoâ€™s passionate about building user-friendly, aesthetic and pixel-perfect applications. This eye of mine comes from the fact that I am quite an artistic person who loves painting. I write technical blogs on medium and hashnode. Layer5 is my first Open Source project as a contributor which has given me immense confidence about my work and capabilities. The community is just amazing.
Also on a fun note, any Harry Potter fan or should I say potterhead out there?"
