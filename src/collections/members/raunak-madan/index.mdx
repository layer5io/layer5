Hi, I’m Raunak Madan, passionate about open-source software and cloud-native technologies. I began my open-source journey in December 2024 after attending KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in Delhi, which sparked my interest in this ecosystem.Since then, I’ve become a strong advocate of open-source culture and enjoy contributing to projects that create real-world impact. 

I have experience across the full-stack and DevOps ecosystem, working with modern programming languages, frameworks, databases, and cloud-native tooling.
