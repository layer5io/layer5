bio: I am a recent CS graduate from CSU-San Marcos living in San Diego, CA. I'm interested in all things related to the cloud and containers. Contributing to Layer5 has been an incredible way to learn new topics and develop my technical skills outside of school. I hope to share my experience with students and grow the open source community at CSU-San Marcos. I'll be starting a new job as a software developer at SAIC where I'll be a part of their DevOps team and will continue to be a contributor for Layer5.
