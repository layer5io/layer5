bio: "I enjoy hot weather and sunny places. I also genuinely love to code - itâ€™s fun. This is probably what brought me to Open Source. I can do Go, and sometimes C (or even C++). I am interested in operating systems, networking, k8s and things.
In software engineering I enjoy the process as much as the results and always looking forward to new things to explore."
