bio: I am a Pre-final year computer science undergraduate at IP University, India. A front-end developer, working with technologies like react.js and next.js. I am always curious about working on computers and websites. I like contributing to the open-source, I have contributed to some organizations such as Fossaisa, JBoss, Layer5, Mexili, etc. Layer5 is one of the most welcoming organizations to which I have contributed. looking forward to learning more from the community and trying to give back as much as I can to the open-source community. In my opinion, open-source is enough to make your code more reachable you don't have to wait to join any tech giant in order to achieve the same.
