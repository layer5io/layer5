bio: Hey there! I'm Savio Dias, a tech enthusiast with a great curiosity for exploring the endless possibilities of technology. As a student at FCRIT, Vashi, I discovered the world of open-source during my sophomore year and I've been hooked ever since. With a keen interest in UI/UX and a good foundation in the MERN stack, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and dive into the dynamic realms of cloud-native technologies and APIs.My commitment to open-source stems from my belief in the power of collaborative learning and community-driven growth. I'm ready to embark on a coding adventure together! Let's connect and let our journey begin with a resounding "Link start" into the realm of technology.
