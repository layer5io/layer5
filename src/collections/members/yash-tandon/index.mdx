bio: "Hey, I'm Yash, a Senior DevOps engineer at Sprinklr. When I'm not working on Kubernetes, distributed systems, DevOps, observability, or Open Source, you can find me playing the drums and listening to some good old rock music. AC/DC and Green Day are my all-time favorite bands, and their music inspires me to tackle complex technical challenges with the same energy and intensity they bring to their performances. I'm also a big fan of Real Madrid and enjoy playing FIFA like a pro. As a passionate advocate for Open Source, I take pleasure in contributing to various open-source projects and communities. I'm passionate about helping organizations build scalable, efficient, and reliable infrastructures that empower their teams to innovate faster. If you're looking to level up your DevOps game, discuss Open Source, jam to some AC/DC or Green Day, or just want to talk about football, don't hesitate to reach out and connect!"
