bio: I am a final-year undergrad student majoring in Computer Science Engineering. I love contributing to open-source projects. I have learnt a lot while contributing to projects at Layer5 and interacting with the community. My contributions are mainly in front-end projects. I also write blogs on Hashnode. I love sharing my knowledge and experiences with others and learning from their backgrounds and journey. I try to give my best in whatever I do. I love travelling and meeting new people from around the world. I also enjoy listening to music and reading books.
