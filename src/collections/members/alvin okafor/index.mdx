bio: I am a Front-End Engineer and Product Designer based in Port-Harcourt, Nigeria. I am passionate about user-centred design and developing web services that improve users' daily lives. When I'm not pushing pixels on the screen or writing code, I love to make beats as a music producer and play games.
