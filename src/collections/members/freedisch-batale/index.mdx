bio: "I’m a Software Engineer from Togo currently based in Kenya. I build and unintentionally break things, which I eventually fix. I have a keen interest in software development, system design and love contributing to open source. Aside from software development, I enjoyed watching anime and reading manga. Feel free to hit on any of my social handles. Always glad to help in any way."
