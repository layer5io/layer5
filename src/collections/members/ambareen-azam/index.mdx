bio: I am a final-year Computer Science & Engineering undergrad. The concept of open source has always held a particular fascination for me, but the perceived complexity of its codebases had previously deterred me from delving deeper into its full potential. However, my recent discovery of the Layer5 community has allowed me to witness firsthand the true splendor of open source, as well as the invaluable benefits of community-driven learning and collaboration.My fervent enthusiasm for acquiring new technological skills serves as a driving force that motivates me to constantly seek out opportunities for personal and professional growth.
