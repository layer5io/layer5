bio: Atinuke Kayode is a Python developer,  a technical writer and an open-source lover. I have learnt through the community so I am community-driven and love to help grow tech communities across the world. I am passionate about seeing young lads set their careers in tech, especially women and I desires to see more young women take up careers in technology. I love to help others. I write on my blog in my free time and read other peopleâ€™s articles. Layer5 has been Home for me gaining techincal skills and how to relate with diverse people.
