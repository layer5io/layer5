bio:
  During the day, I'm a Global Learning Management System Administrator and Trainer for a pharma company based in Switzerland. 
  Outside work, I'm a Cloud Native passionate with a “twist” everything I do or test, is from Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). 
  After years of blogging and helping the community, this year I've been nominated Docker Captain, CNCF Ambassador and dual Microsoft MVP.
