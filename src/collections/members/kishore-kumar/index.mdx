bio:
  I am an undergrad engineer majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I am a passionate Front-End developer and a Web designer, contributing to open-source projects. My experience is mainly in the field of frameworks and Static-Site generators like Gatsby, React and Jekyll among others.
  I have a good command over various programming languages. My projects include creating a search engine for GitHub Users, a Portfolio website created using React and a ToDo Application. My contributions in the last Hacktoberfest and in challenges like HackerRank stand testimony to my credentials.
  I also blog about various topics of interest on Dev.io.
