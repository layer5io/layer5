            <h1>Open Source is in our DNA</h1>
            <p>
              Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms of Apache v2.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity, and strength of our community.

              pay attention to detail and take pride in your work. Know when to pri- oritize and have the discipline to adhere to those priorities. Focus on the customer. Pay it forward and enable others. Bring solutions with the problems. Take out the trash (do grunt work) as needed.</p>

          <p className="center">Layer5 goes out of its way to welcome and encourage new contributors. We often assign newcomers an onboarding buddy, a MeshMate, to ensure that newcomers get both introduced to the projects within the community and introduced around to other individuals. We strive to help them get a foothold on a crevice of one of our initiatives, instilling and nurturing a sense of ownership, so that they feel at-home as they become a regular contributor.</p>
          <p className="center">
            We also spend a great deal of time trying to recognize and uplift contributors on the Layer5 and Meshery Twitter accounts whether “contribution” means code or any of the other various forms of being involved int the projects and community. Likewise, we try to lift up contributors’ works on the Layer5 and Meshery LinkedIn pages, too. And, while it’s not a world stage, we openly and publicly share our community meetings on YouTube.
