            <h4>What to Expect</h4>
            <p>
                The program pairs experienced Layer5 community members with community
                newcomers to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. There is a lot going in
                the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move fast. MeshMates are
                committed to helping their mentees in identifying an area of the projects to
                engage within, working groups to join, growing their Cloud Native knowledge,
                and network of relationships. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share
                tips on how to have the best community experience possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meshtees are encouraged to get to know their MeshMate as soon as they are
                assigned (MeshMates and Mentees will be introduced in the Layer5 Slack).
                Help your MeshMate understand your current skills, ideal topics of learning,
                and areas of passion. Doing so will help them to point out various aspects
                of projects that you might find your first foothold.
            </p>
            <h4>Meeting Your MeshMate</h4>
            <p>
                Slack’s video chat or Google Hangouts are both available for your use as tools for getting to know one another. While getting acquainted
                and onboarding into the community, we suggest the following goals:
