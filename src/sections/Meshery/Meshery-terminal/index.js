                  <p>
                    Meshery supports cloud native application patterns using a mesh-agnostic and application-holistic approach: patternfiles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Patternfiles stems from multiple open needs, one of which is the desire to define a common practice of both configuring and operating service mesh functionality in a single, universal file.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a patternfile, you cancapture service mesh behavior in a single file. You can access service mesh-specific differentiation while keeping your patterns short and simple.
