        <ul>
          <li className="gsoc">
            <b>Description</b>: Many performance benchmarks are limited to single
            instance load generation (single pod load generator). This limits the
            amount of traffic that can be generated to output of the single machine
            that the benchmark tool runs on in or out of a cluster. Overcoming this
            limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing. Distributed
            load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without
            losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail
            percentiles. Use Mesheryâ€™s interface for supporting different load
            generators (a point of extensibility) to place support for Vegeta.
            Workloads running on service meshes are hit in various ways and
            generally not from the same source. Use of a distributed load generator
            will aid in the testing of service mesh behavior.

        <b>What is Layer5?</b>
      </p>
      <p>  
      While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
      service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
      projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
      practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking
      opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit
      pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
      </p>
      <p>  
        <b>Is it Open Source?</b>
      </p>  
      <p>  
      Layer5 projects are open source software. Anyone can download, use, work
      on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration,
      globalism, and innovation. Layer5 projects are distributed under the terms
      of Apache v2.
      </p>  
      <p>  
        <b>Google Summer of Code Participation?</b>
      </p>  
      <p>  
      The key component of these projects is our Community. This community,
      which you will join as an participant in Google Summer of Code, is
      improving the world of diverse cloud native systems. Your contributions
      will affect people you've never met. The Layer5 community includes
      software engineers, researchers, students, artists, system administrators,
      operators and web designers -- all of whom will be happy to help you get
      started.
      </p>  
      <p>  
      We believe that all contributors should expect and be part of a safe and
      friendly environment for constructive contribution. We can more
      effectively and successfully compare and challenge different ideas to find
      the best solutions for advancement, while building the size, diversity,
      and strength of our community.
