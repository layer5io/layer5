            Applying spatial values to designs is a much debated topic and can
            prove to be quite difficult and very confusing especially when
            trying to maintain consistency across all designs. To this end, a
            few concepts have been pieced together in order to simplify the
            understanding of spatial harmony and ensure a consistent execution.
          </p>
          <a id="Spatial Organization">
            <h2>Spatial Organization</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            Mostly in an interface, the way space and spatial harmony is
            achieved is by applying these space values to specific elements or
            in specific use cases. This can range form the size of a given
            element to the space between elements on a page.
          </p>
          <h3>Gap</h3>
          <p>
            Gap can be used to represent the space between any two given
            elements in an interface. This can be the inset values in a button
            or a card, stack or inline spacing between blocks of text or a group
            of elements in a section, and can also be applicable for margin
            values in a grid system. Because this can be confusing to determine
            a mode of application given that the spatial system consists of over
            10 different values, a set consisting of five to seven values can be
            chosen to serve as all the values for the 'gap' spacing that will be
            used in an interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arriving at these values, however is not arbitrary or random
            selection from the spacing scale. Instead, a geometric progression
            gotten by multiplying the base space value by a common ratio of two
            and also dividing by the same ratio will provide the values needed
            to populate the 'gap' category. This arrangement will ensure uniform
            space across an interface that will greatly help to establish
            element relationships and hierarchy.
          </p>
          <Row Hcenter className="image-container">
            <Col md={8} lg={8} sm={12}>
              <img
                src={isDark ? SpaceTokenTable2Dark : SpaceTokenTable2}
                alt="Space Token Table"
              />
            </Col>
          </Row>
          <p>
            *The last spacing value of 80px that was included was added because
            80px is the value for the margin in the 12 column grid that is being
            applied for desktop screens.
          </p>
          <h3>Radius</h3>
          <p>
            The radius value of elements in an interface help to define the
            theme and density that it conveys. Little to no radius can describe
            a more grotesque or brutal theme, while higher and more consistent
            use of radiuses can describe a modern and minimal UI theme. Radius
            values can be determined based on the use case and the needs of the
            designs being curated. With Layer5, we have chosen five radius
            values that can provide a the much needed variation that can help to
            describe a minimal and consistent user interface.
          </p>
          <Row Hcenter className="image-container">
            <Col md={8} lg={8} sm={12}>
              <img
                src={isDark ? SpaceTokenTable3Dark : SpaceTokenTable3}
                alt="Space Token Table"
              />
            </Col>
          </Row>
          <p>
            As is the case with most user interface decisions that are agreed
            upon, these values should be subjected to proper scrutiny based on
            the intended use case as well as appropriate exploration to ensure
            the best possible application.
          </p>
          <h3>Size</h3>
          <p>
            Size refers to the amount of area that an atom or element of a
            design takes up in the available space of the user interface.
            Whether itâ€™s that of an icon or the total size of an image, all of
            that space can be described as size. While it is true that much
            larger size values may not necessarily be strictly defined in the
            spatial system, elements which are frequently used and require a
            fixed size throughout a design can have specific values assigned to
            them to ensure consistency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applicable scenarios can be in the case of buttons, text fields,
            some cards, navigation menus, logos, and icons. While there are
            exceptions to these elements, mostly, it is recommended that they
            appear in a uniform size across an interface to improve the
            consistency therein.
          </p>
          <a id="Space Application Considerations">
            <h2>Space Application Considerations</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            For spacing to be effectively employed in designs, a few
            considerations are to be made to enable a simple, yet, uniform
            application of space values across designs. One such principles is
            that in a bounding box, the padding of the box should be the highest
            spacing value. This simply means that for any container, (could be a
            card, button, an entire page layout) both the horizontal and
            vertical padding values must be more than any other space values
            used inside of the container to separate its child elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is applicable whether the horizontal and vertical paddings have
            the same or different values. To provide more, clarity, the inline
            spacing in a container should not be more than its horizontal
            padding, and the stack spacing value should not be more than the
            container's vertical padding. This gradual decrease in the space
            value as we go deeper into a container or an element helps to
            enhance uniformity and consistency across designs.
          </p>
          <h3>Exceptions</h3>
          <p>
            Of course, these suggestions are not set in stone, and as such,
            exceptions should be made to accommodate the peculiar needs of a
            design and its existing principles. One of the cases where
            exceptions can apply is when proper separation needs to be
            established among a group of elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although most pages will have a horizontal padding value, they
            seldom have a vertical padding value and since elements are mostly
            arranged in a vertical stack in a digital interface, it becomes
            necessary that proper separation is established in order to assist
            users to easily identify sections and navigate through the content
            of a page in the proper manner for better understanding. Varying
            values of space can therefore be employed in this vertical stack to
            improve users' clarity and minimize any confusion encountered.
