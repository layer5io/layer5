            Spacing is a foundational consideration in any design endeavor. From
            intra component spacing to space between elements in a given layout,
            intentional application of spacing across a digital experience
            elevates its usability, improves its (or the) experience, and
            eventually generates much needed website traffic which is a primary
            goal for most digital solutions.

          <a id="The Basics">
            <h2>The Basics</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            A few concepts can be handy to keep in mind as we consider spacing
            and its application throughout designs to ensure clarity and proper
            understanding.
          </p>
          <h3>Inset</h3>
          <p>
            Inset describes the value of padding for any container in the
            interface. The description of a container can range from full page
            layouts, to page sections, all the way down to card containers and
            even icon frames. Inset accounts for the values of both horizontal
            and vertical padding. The horizontal and vertical paddings donâ€™t
            need to have the same value, however, it is recommended that the
            values for the horizontal padding are equivalent. This principle
            applies to the values for the vertical paddings as well.
          </p>
          <h3>Stack</h3>
          <p>
            Stack in spacing is used to describe the space between vertically
            arranged content in a digital interface. Since most digital content
            is read from top to bottom, It is only right that they are arranged
            in such a way that accurately conveys hierarchy, relationship and
            spatial harmony.
          </p>
          <h3>Inline</h3>
          <p>
            This is the horizontal space consideration given to elements that
            are being arranged in an interface. It can be the space between text
            input, horizontally stacked elements like buttons and so on.
          </p>
          <a id="Scaling">
            <h2>Scaling</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            To properly implement spacing, a set of values have to be generated
            using a scale just like was done in the case of typography. This
            avails us with a fixed range of values that provide the much needed
            flexibility required by interfaces to be consistent. This range
            could be derived from a base spacing value which follows a principle
            like a linear scale from the base value, multiples of the base
            value, the golden ratio, or a modular scale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most digital screen resolutions are divisible by 16 which is a
            multiple of eight and so, this makes it a good reason to utilize
            eight as our base spacing value. Our scale, therefore, has been
            derived from multiples of eight with a half and quarter step of
            eight included in the scale to account for much smaller space
            considerations, for example, icon padding. The half and quarter
            steps have values of two and four respectively.
          </p>
          <Row Hcenter className="image-container">
            <Col md={8} lg={8} sm={12}>
              <img
                src={isDark ? SpaceTokenTable1Dark : SpaceTokenTable1}
                alt="Space Token Table"
              />
            </Col>
          </Row>
          <p>
            From this scale of multiples of eight, space values for different
            purposes can now be selected for use in an interface raging from gap
            between elements on a page to size of elements, to corner radiuses
            and other space considerations.
          </p>
          <a id="Text and Spacing">
            <h2>Text and Spacing</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            One factor that should be accounted for when sorting out spacing and
            other considerations for spatial harmony is text size. Mostly this
            affects the stack spacing values and their arrangement. Having all
            text sizes in a multiple of the base spacing value is a principle
            that can help to avoid inconsistent looking text and space across an
            interface. This should also be the same for the line height that
            accompanies these text sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mostly, the text is arranged in a pattern that takes into
            consideration the line height of the different sizes of text used in
            order to represent proper hierarchy and relationships between text
            content in an interface.
