        Spacing is a foundational consideration in any design endeavor. From
        intra component spacing to space between elements in a given layout,
        intentional application of spacing across a digital experience elevates
        its usability, improves its (or the) experience, and eventually
        generates much needed website traffic which is a primary goal for most
        digital solutions.

        <h2>The Basics</h2>

      <p>
        A few concepts can be handy to keep in mind as we consider spacing and
        its application throughout designs to ensure clarity and proper
        understanding.

      <h3>Inset</h3>
      <p>
        Inset describes the value of padding for any container in the interface.
        The description of a container can range from full page layouts, to page
        sections, all the way down to card containers and even icon frames.
        Inset accounts for the values of both horizontal and vertical padding.
        The horizontal and vertical paddings donâ€™t need to have the same value,
        however, it is recommended that the values for the horizontal padding
        are equivalent. This principle applies to the values for the vertical
        paddings as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Stack</h3>
      <p>
        Stack in spacing is used to describe the space between vertically
        arranged content in a digital interface. Since most digital content is
        read from top to bottom, It is only right that they are arranged in such
        a way that accurately conveys hierarchy, relationship and spatial
        harmony.
      </p>
      <h3>Inline</h3>
      <p>
        This is the horizontal space consideration given to elements that are
        being arranged in an interface. It can be the space between text input,
        horizontally stacked elements like buttons and so on.

      <a id="Scaling">
        <h2>Scaling</h2>
      </a>
      <p>
        To properly implement spacing, a set of values have to be generated
        using a scale just like was done in the case of typography. This avails
        us with a fixed range of values that provide the much needed flexibility
        required by interfaces to be consistent. This range could be derived
        from a base spacing value which follows a principle like a linear scale
        from the base value, multiples of the base value, the golden ratio, or a
        modular scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most digital screen resolutions are divisible by 16 which is a multiple
        of eight and so, this makes it a good reason to utilize eight as our
        base spacing value. Our scale, therefore, has been derived from
        multiples of eight with a half and quarter step of eight included in the
        scale to account for much smaller space considerations, for example,
        icon padding. The half and quarter steps have values of two and four
        respectively.
