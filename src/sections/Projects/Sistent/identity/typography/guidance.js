            After a suitable typeface has been chosen, it needs to be arranged
            to form the various fonts that will be used to address different
            text needs across designs.
          </p>
          <a id="Type Scale Customization">
            <h2>Type Scale Customization</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            It is not compulsory that all of the sizes in a type scale be used.
            However, when choosing a size from the scale, ensure to identify
            possible use cases in proposed designs to ensure efficiency and
            reduce any chances of having redundant text styles. Remember that
            less is more and a particular font size can function in multiple
            capacities. After making a selection of sizes, if there is
            subsequent need for an additional size because of a recurring use
            case, then a suitable corresponding size can be chosen from the
            scale. This is a better practice.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Layer5, we utilized the major third ratio to generate a type
            scale that we could work with.

          <Row $Hcenter className="image-container">
            <Col md={8} lg={8} sm={12}>
              <img
                src={isDark ? TypeScale2Dark : TypeScale2}

            From this type scale, seven text sizes were selected to account for
            various needs in our websites and products. These sizes were further
            modified with suitable font specifications that will provide
            accurate guidance for usage across implementations.
          </p>
          <Row $Hcenter className="image-container">
            <Col md={8} lg={8} sm={12}>
              <img
                src={isDark ? TypeScale3Dark : TypeScale3}

            To create even more consistent designs, it is important to consider
            typography with spacing and spatial proportions in mind. As a rule
            of thumb, it is advisable that values obtained from the modular
            scale are rounded off to a multiple of the base space value being
            used across a set of designs. So for instance, if a set of designs
            has a base space value of 4px or 6px, then, the font sizes selected
            are rounded off to be multiples of four or six respectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            In keeping with this, the values of the above sizes are noticeably
            distinct from the original type scale that it was derived from. This
            is because our base space value is 8px and as such, all the text
            sizes have been rounded off to a multiple of eight. This same
            principle is applied to the accompanying line heights of these text
            sizes as well.
          </p>
          <h3>Layout Considerations</h3>
          <p>
            For any digital product or website being created, one important
            thing to be considered is the responsive nature of design, which
            translates to what the said design will look like across different
            screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile). To this end, it is also
            crucial that any of the text styles selected account for these
            different layout sizes as well. As stated earlier, text styles can
            be used for multiple needs across a given design. The important
            thing is that there is proper documentation to point this out,
            ensuring that hierarchy and prominence are duly established.
          </p>
          <a id="Establishing Hierarchy">
            <h2>Establishing Hierarchy</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            Since the selected text sizes cannot all be used for the same
            purpose, it is necessary to differentiate them from each other in
            order to have a working typography system that applies to different
            use cases and layout sizes. This will require exploration and
            multiple tests of these text styles in the screen sizes they are
            intended for and the possible use cases that they will account for
            which may have already been identified in the early stages before
            use.
          </p>
          <p>
            With these seven different text sizes derived from the type scale,
            we have come up with 13 fonts that can be applied in multiple use
            cases and across multiple devices. This variation ensures that fonts
            are not created randomly and utilized based on individual
            discretion, eventually leading to multiple redundant fonts present
            in our type system. These fonts must be considered first for
            application in any use case. If the need arises for a new font to be
            added to the type system, sufficient use cases have to be
            established to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>NOTE:</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A new font can be something as little as changing only the font
            weight of an already existing font and having both variations
            function in different capacities. Of course it can also include
            replacing an already existing font or creating an entirely new one
            to add to the type system.
          </p>
          <a id="Font Specification">
            <h2>Font Specification</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            Each font should not be a product of random choices just to have a
            set of text to work with. They should be informed decisions based on
            how they can assist to reinforce a brand, what they can be used to
            achieve in designs, and to what extent they should be applied. For
            more documentation, check out details on each font in the Code
            section for `Typography`.
          </p>
          <h3>Heading</h3>
          <p>
            Headings are usually the first thing a user sees when reading a
            block of text. The idea is for them to be concise and provide a hint
            of what readers can expect from the accompanying body of text or an
            entire page. It should also capture attention and encourage further
            exploration. They can range from large hero section headings to much
            smaller subtitle and label headings. Whatever the case, headings at
            different sizes can help to accurately indicate hierarchy and
            provide guidance for any reader going through a group of text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of Layer5â€™s ten fonts, seven of them can function as heading text
            and ensure hierarchy for different context. For text that needs to
            be prominent in a group of text (especially at the beginning), any
            one of these fonts will suffice.
          </p>
          <h3>Body</h3>
          <p>
            A bulk of text content is written in body or paragraph fonts. These
            are less prominent (larger) fonts that provide more context to what
            brief ideas any available headings may have outlined. It can also be
            used for short text in components and when creating other interface
            elements due to its higher legibility when compared to heading or
            subtitle texts. Three font sizes have been earmarked to function in
            this capacity for the text needs in Layer5 and across all of its
            products.
          </p>
          <h3>Label</h3>
          <p>
            To highlight supplementary information for interface elements, label
            texts can suffice. They provide extra information for users as they
            navigate a solution. Label texts ideally do not need to be too
            prominent hence their smaller size compared to the body text
            category. There are two label texts available in the Sistent type
            system.
          </p>
          <h3>Code</h3>
          <p>
            This fonts are curated specifically for the purpose of writing code
            across our websites and solutions. They can be used to highlight
            code related text in designs like token values, code snippets for
            components and any other code related application. Two fonts have
            been made available for this purpose.
