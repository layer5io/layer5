            There are a couple of things to consider when preparing to apply
            typography to any interface.
          </p>
          <a id="The Basics">
            <h2>The Basics</h2>
          </a>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Typeface</h3>
          <p>
            A typeface is a set of letters, numbers, and accessories that have
            common design features. These characters are usually grouped into
            families and used in relation to each other to ensure uniform text
            representation in designs and forms of text that are relative to
            each other. Qanelas Soft, Times New Roman, Merriweather, and Roboto
            are all examples of typefaces.
          </p>
          <h3>Font</h3>
          <p>
            Often wrongly used interchangeably with typeface, a font refers to
            variations of a typeface. So this includes the weight, size, line
            height, tracking (letter spacing), and any other features that are
            added to a typeface for it to function in a certain capacity. A key
            relationship between a typeface and a font is that characters in a
            typeface can be modified to form different fonts.
          </p>
          <h3>Line Height</h3>
          <p>
            Line height is mostly used to refer to the distance between lines of
            text. WCAG standards for line height recommend a line height that is
            at least 1.5 times the chosen font size, especially for small text
            sizes. For larger fonts, however, evidence has shown that anything
            between 1.2 and 1.5 times the font size might also be appropriate,
            especially considering the fact that most large fonts used for
            headings and subheadings tend not to exceed a single line of text.
          </p>
          <a id="Type Scale">
            <h2>Type Scale</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            Type scale with respect to typography points to the set of
            incremental steps or rations that dictate how font sizes increase or
            decrease as you move up or down a given hierarchy. This increase or
            decrease is usually originated from a base size that serves as the
            defining font within the scale. These steps create a systemic
            progression of font sizes that maintain harmony and visual balance
            within a system because of the relationship they share with the base
            font.
          </p>
          <p>
            The base size used to generate a type scale is determined by the
            principles governing size, typography, and other brand specific
            contexts. As a design best practice, a text size of 16px is
            generally accepted as very legible for responsive design. It is also
            a multiple of eight which is our base space value and this is
            further elaborated on in
            <strong>
              <a href="/projects/sistent/identity/spacing"> Spacing</a>
            </strong>
            . Reasons like these influence its use as a base size for our type
            scale. A modular type scale can be generated using harmonious values
            like the golden ratio, the major third, the perfect fifth, and so
            on.
          </p>
          <Row $Hcenter className="image-container">
            <Col md={8} lg={8} sm={12}>
              <img
                src={isDark ? TypeScale1Dark : TypeScale1}
                alt="Type Scale"
              />
            </Col>
          </Row>
          <p>
            Because of the progressive increase or decrease that governs the
            content of a type scale, it makes it easier to obtain consistent,
            related, and harmonious font sizes that can each be used for
            specific needs when curating digital interfaces.
          </p>
          <a id="Font Pairing">
            <h2>Font Pairing</h2>
          </a>
          <p>
            Sometimes, it might be necessary to make use of more than one
            typeface. In such a case, an applicable principle is that one of the
            typefaces is used mostly for headings and subheadings, while the
            other is used for most paragraphs and body text needs across the
            same design. Detailed research on typefaces and their compatibility
            will help to make informed decisions when it comes to choosing a
            typeface for font pairing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Layer5 has successfully been able to implement a font pairing of
            Qanelas Soft for all heading and subheading text and Open Sans for
            all body, paragraph, and content text needs.
