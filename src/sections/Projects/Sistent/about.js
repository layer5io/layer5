              We have several different React apps that heavily uses the
              Material UI v4 and v5 libraries, and this discrepancies led up to
              setting up the Sistent Design System.

              'Sistent' is a play on word to ensure that we have a consistent
              theme, components, design tokens, etc across all of the apps that
              will be using this library. Sistent is a design system that uses
              the <b>MUI v5 components</b> and a <b>custom theme provider </b>
              instead of using the default theme from MUI v5.
            </p>
