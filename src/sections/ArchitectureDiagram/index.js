          <h2 className={"use-heading"}>Why use an architecture diagramming software?</h2>
          <p>Cognitive overload is real. Trying to hold all elements of your  environment in your mind can be challenging, but a visual diagram of your cloud architecture will help you stay up to date with its status, understand the relationship between components, identify and solve problems. This complexity adds up when multiple team members are working on the same project. A collaborative cloud diagramming sofware could help to pinpoint information and ensure that everybody is on the same page.</p>
