          <p>A Community Manager is a person who has an innate drive to contribute to the community's prosperity. 
            A community manager serves as a link between the organisation and its community, 
            overcoming obstacles as they arise—or even before they arise!—by collaborating with other departments and the community to find solutions that benefit the entire community.</p>
