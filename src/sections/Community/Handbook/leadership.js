              A leader is someone who can contribute to the Layer5 Community's

              feeling responsible.

              Roles/Responsibilities: <br />A Community Manager is a person who
              has an innate drive to contribute to the community's prosperity. A
              community manager serves as a link between the organisation and
              its community, overcoming obstacles as they arise—or even before
              they arise!—by collaborating with other departments and the
              community to find solutions that benefit the entire community.
