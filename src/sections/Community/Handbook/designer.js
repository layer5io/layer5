            We are always looking for ways to improve the user experience of our projects. If you have ideas for how to improve the user experience of any of our projects, please share them with us.

            <h2>Where can you contribute?</h2>

            <p>
            You can contribute to the Meshery project website redesign and creation of new video-based content. The site structure and content need a revamp, and contributors will use the existing brand guide, colors, and logos in their designs. The project also requires video editing and graphic/illustration creation skills. If you want to participate in the project and build your portfolio in collaboration with the Meshery team, you can submit your interest by filling out the form provided.
