            As an open source-first community, we very much appreciate the engagement of individuals within the Layer5 community. We wouldn't be here without you. Our success is a collective one.Consequently, we are quite intentional about defining and encouraging the journey for each individual community member. No small part of their journey is that of recongizing their accomplishments and publicly celebrating their accolades. We do so in a number of ways.

            <p>
              As you continue making your contributions to Layer5 projects, you
              will be given an invite to the github org for the project you have
              been diligently contributing to. This invitation can be from all
              four github orgs of Layer5 depending on the number of
              contributions you make.

              Once a contributor joins the Layer5 community by filling in the
              community member form, they are automatically classified as
              members of Layer5. Although, you earn a member profile after
              consistent contributions to the community for and projects. You
              can find out more about the Members profile on the Layer5 website.
            </p>
            <p>Member profiles carry a number of specific designations, depending upon how a community member is participating. One of those designations is that of whether the member is actively particpating or has gone dormant. We define "active" and "inactive" members in the following way:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Active</b> - Members who are engaged and participating in any aspect of the community and/or its projects. Activities vary broadly from meeting attendance to helping other contributors to using and providing feedback on projects, to code contribution, and so on.
              </li>
              <li><b>Inactive</b>  - Members who have previously engaged but have not participated in the community or projects within ~two months.</li>

            <p>
              Badges are awarded to community members who have been consistently engaged and impactful within a given area of the community or on a specific project. Every community member, whether contributing with code or not, has the opportunity to obtain any number of badges of recognition of their efforts. Community members are encouraged to collect the whole set!
