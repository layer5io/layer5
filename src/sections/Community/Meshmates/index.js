                  MeshMates aid in identifying areas of projects to engage within, working groups to join,
                  and in helping community members grow in their open source and cloud native knowledge.
                  By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share tips on how to have the best community experience possible.

          <p> MeshMate is a distinction that Layer5 awards select members of the community that who innately align with the Layer5 culture of helping others, paying it forward, and have a commitment to sharing their knowledge of Layer5 projects with the community. MeshMates are Layer5 ambassadors (not employees) and their commitment to helping others and sharing their expertise has a huge impact on the Layer5 community – don’t hesitate to reach out to them! </p>

          <h2> Engaging with a MeshMate</h2>
          <p> The program pairs experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move fast. MeshMates are committed to helping their mentees in identifying an area of the projects to engage within, working groups to join, growing their Cloud Native knowledge, and network of relationships. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share tips on how to have the best community experience possible. </p>
          <p> Meshtees are encouraged to get to know their MeshMate as soon as they are assigned (MeshMates and Mentees will be introduced in the Layer5 Slack). Help your MeshMate understand your current skills, ideal topics of learning, and areas of passion. Doing so will help them to point out various aspects of projects that you might find your first foothold. </p>
