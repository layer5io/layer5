                GitOps is a way to define workflows for declarative
                configuration using Git. Meshery greatly simplifies configuring
                and managing cloud native infrastructure at-scale across

                  Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different
                  Kuberentes-based infrastructure, exposing the tools'
                  differentiated value to users. Care is taken in each Meshery
                  Adapter to expose the unique value of each component.{" "}

                  Meshery is not just an application. It is a set of
                  microservices where the central component is itself called
                  Meshery. Integrators may extend Meshery by taking advantage of
                  designated Extension Points. Extension points come in various
                  forms and are available through Mesherys architecture.

                  Adapters are optional components that enhance and extend
                  Mesheryâ€™s core functionality. Multiple adapters of the same
                  type may be deployed concurrently. The default configuration
                  of a Meshery deployment includes one instance of each of the
                  Meshery adapters.
