Project Overview & Core Purpose  \n- **Purpose:** This is a customer support ticketing system built with a React frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend.  \n- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL.  \n- **Key Goal:** Provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly interface for support agents to manage customer issues.\n\n## 2. Architecture & Design Patterns  \n- **Database:** We use PostgreSQL for its reliability and ACID compliance. All business logic involving payments or user accounts must be transactional.  \n- **Caching:** Redis is used for session storage and caching non-critical data. Never cache user-private data.  \n- **State Management (Frontend):** Use React Query for server state and Zustand for global UI state. Avoid prop-drilling.  \n- **API Design:** We follow RESTful principles. All API error responses must include a \\`requestId\\` for easier debugging.\n\n## 3. Code Standards & Conventions  \n- **Formatting:** We use Prettier with the settings in \\`.prettierrc\\`. All code must be formatted on commit.  \n- **Linting:** ESLint is configured with rules in \\`.eslintrc.js\\`. Pay close attention to rules against using \\`any\\`.  \n- **Naming:**  \n    - Components: \\`PascalCase\\` (e.g., \\`TicketList.tsx\\`)  \n    - API endpoints: \\`kebab-case\\` (e.g., \\`/api/user-tickets\\`)  \n    - Functions: \\`camelCase\\` (e.g., \\`fetchUserData\\`)  \n- **Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library. All new components must have at least 80% test coverage for critical paths.\n\n## 4. Build, Test, & Deploy Pipeline  \n- **Local Setup:** Run \\`npm install\\` and then \\`npm run dev\\`.  \n- **Running Tests:** \\`npm test\\`  \n- **Build Command:** \\`npm run build\\`  \n- **Deployment:** Pushes to the \\`main\\` branch trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to Vercel.\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls & API Nuances  \n- **Stripe API:** All POST requests are idempotent. It's safe to retry them.  \n- **SendGrid API:** This API has strict rate limits. All email-sending tasks should be pushed to our Redis queue.  \n- **Authentication:** If you see auth errors locally, it's likely because the Redis server died. Restart it with \\`redis-server\\`.\n\n## 6. Git & PR Workflow  \n- **Branch Naming:** \\`feature/ticket-123-add-search-bar\\`  \n- **Commit Messages:** Follow the Conventional Commits specification. (e.g., \\`feat: add user profile page\\`)  \n- **Pull Requests:** Must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging. Link the associated ticket in the PR description.\n")),o.createElement(t.p,null,o.createElement(t.em,null,"Start small, and let it grow.")," Your AGENTS.md doesn't need to be perfect on day one.
