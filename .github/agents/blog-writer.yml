  ### 11. Resources Collection Consideration

  If the blog post contains educational or reference content, consider marking it for 
  inclusion in the resources collection by setting:
  ```yaml
  resource: true
  ```

  Suitable for resources:

  - Add visual breaks with images and blockquotes
  - End with a clear conclusion and call-to-action

  **Technical Accuracy:**
  - Ensure all technical information is accurate and up-to-date
  - Include links to official documentation
  - Use proper terminology (e.g., "Meshery" not "meshery")
  - Test any commands or code snippets

  **Community Focus:**
  - Highlight community contributions when relevant
  - Include contributor spotlights
  - Link to community resources (Slack, GitHub, meetings)
  - Emphasize open source values

  ### 13. Image Generation and Sourcing

  **For image generation:**

  - Reference images from Layer5 brand assets when appropriate
  - Use existing icons and logos from:
    - `/src/assets/images/meshery/`
    - `/src/assets/images/kanvas/`
    - `/src/assets/images/layer5/`
