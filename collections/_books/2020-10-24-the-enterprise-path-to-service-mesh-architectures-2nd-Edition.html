  Planning to build a microservice-driven cloud native application or looking to
  modernize existing application services? Consider using a service mesh. A
  service mesh approach can help you create robust and scalable applications,
  but it also introduces new challenges. This updated report answers common
  questions regarding service mesh architectures through the lens of a large
  enterprise.

<p>
  Author Lee Calcote, founder and CEO of Layer5, shows developers, operators,
  architects, and IT leaders how to evaluate your organization’s readiness for
  using a service mesh—and provides a clear path to help you adopt one. You’ll
  evaluate several factors when deciding which applications should be built from
  the ground up and which can be converted with a new service mesh architecture.
  This updated edition discusses several service meshes available and the tools
  you need to implement them. You’ll explore:
