        <h3>
        Purpose and Overview
        </h3>
        <p>Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that arguably more accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources. This project is being developed by Kush Trivedi as a part of Google Summer of Code intern with CNCF and Layer5.
        </p>
        <h4> Distributed Performance Benchmarking</h4>
        <p>Currently, <a href="https://meshery.io/">Meshery</a> which is a multi-service mesh management plane which can operate & adapt to various different service meshes only supports a single way load testing. Overcoming this limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing. Nighthawk is a versatile HTTP load testing tool built out of a need to drill HTTP services with a constant request rate. Nighthawk even supports gRPC service which can be used to perform consecutive benchmarks test, making it unique of its kind.

        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <p>The main aim of this project is to enhance the current load generation and analysis technique of Nighthawk to include distributed load testing which may ultimately benefit the meshery to directly adopt the distributed load generation. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Identifying the use-cases of Nighthawk. Working with the nighthawk team to successfully enable distributed load generation in nighthawk.</li>
        <li>Integrating the Nighthawk into the Meshery server and improving the load handling for Nighthawk using the same.</li>
        <li>Handling of the report and displaying mechanisms at the client-side.</li>
        <li>Testing & Debugging the Load Generator & finishing the implementation on Nighthawk.</li>
        </ul>
