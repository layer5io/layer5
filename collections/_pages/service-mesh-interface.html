    <h3>
      Purpose and Overview
    </h3>
    <p>The scope of this initiative includes all service mesh projects participating in the Service Mesh Interface specification. It’s important to acknowledge that conformance consists of both capabilities and compliance status. 
    </p>
    <h4>Project Goals</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide users with a compatibility matrix identifying the SMI features that are supported per service mesh.</li>
      <li>An easy-to-use, service mesh and SMI-specific tool to give service mesh projects and users a suite of repeatable conformance tests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Project Objectives
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Define what it means to be in conformance with the SMI specifications. </li>
      <li>Define a set of conformance tests and  what behavior is expected of a conforming service mesh implementation.</li>
      <li>Built into each participating service mesh project’s release tooling.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Validating Conformance</h4>
<p>Conformance to SMI specifications will be done through use of a service mesh’s workload. A sample application is used as the workload to test.</p>
<h5>Sample Application</h5>
<p>To facilitate a common set of tests, a sample application has been developed for purposes of providing a consistent workload to apply SMI specs against. 
  A deployment of the <a href="https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5">Learn Layer5</a> sample application being fitted to each service mesh.</p>
