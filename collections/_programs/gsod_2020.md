## Season of Docs

Google [Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) gives technical writers an opportunity to work with open source projects.

Layer5 is planning to participate in the Season of Docs in 2020. We'll announce more details pending our acceptance into the program.

### 2020 Project Ideas

### Improve Meshery's Documentation

**API Documentation**
 - Prepare Meshery's API Endpoint Documentation using Swagger.
 - Facilitate a documentation that provides developer playground and test interactions.

**User Tutorials**
- Create structured, hands-on user tutorials that walk users through various user flows (similar to https://tutorials.keptn.sh)
Developer / Contributor Framework
- Participate in the design of a dynamic framework for developers to use to ensure that error codes presented to users include a common set of metadata (e.g. a unique error code, description, likely cause, and suggested remediations)
- Identify and enforce standardized release notes practices.

**Set of Project Docs**
- Design and create a complete set of User Guide, Admin Guide, Install and Upgrade Guide, Developer Guide, and so on.
- Identify opportunities for improvements in current documentation website.

#### Project goals

Our goal is to have helpful, consistent, and integrated tutorials for contributors, and readers of API reference docs.

- Use the [Swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) to generate the API Endpoint documentation.
- Use any open-source training track tool to create tutorial for Meshery and performance management.
- Update the contribution documentation and create an user guide for [Meshery](https://meshery.io).
