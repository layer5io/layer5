## MLH Fellowship Program

The Major League Hacking's [MLH Fellowship](https://https://fellowship.mlh.io/) is an internship alternative for software engineers. Instead of working on a project for just one company, you'll contribute to Open Source projects that are used by companies around the world. You'll collaborate with a group of 10 students under the guidance of a professional mentor whose only job is to help you successfully contribute.

Layer5's [Meshery Project](https://https://meshery.io/) is participating in the MLH Fellowship's internship program in 2020.
