## MLH Fellowship Program

The Major League Hacking's [MLH Fellowship](https://https://fellowship.mlh.io/) is an internship alternative for software engineers. Instead of working on a project for just one company, you'll contribute to Open Source projects that are used by companies around the world. You'll collaborate with a group of 10 students under the guidance of a professional mentor whose only job is to help you successfully contribute.

Layer5's [Meshery Project](https://https://meshery.io/) is participating in the MLH Fellowship's internship program in 2020.

### Projects Ideas

#### Meshery

<b>Description:</b> 
Meshery is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. Service mesh operators are in desparate need of visualization of their cloud native infrastructure and workloads. Networking is complex and virtual networking even more complex. Interactive visual topologies of service meshes and their workloads are key to helping developers and operators take the blinders off when creating and running microservices and their infrastructure.

<b>Recommended Skills:</b> 
- ReactJS, javascript, D3js, cytoscape
- Golang
- (nice to have) Kubernetes, Service Mesh, Docker
