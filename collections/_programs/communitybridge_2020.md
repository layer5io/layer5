## CommunityBridge

The Linux Foundation's [CommunityBridge](https://communitybridge.org) is building a healthy ecosystem around the open source software by funding projects, securing code, and connecting with talented developers.

Layer5 is planning to participate in the CommunityBridge's mentorship program in 2020. We'll announce more details pending our acceptance into the program.
