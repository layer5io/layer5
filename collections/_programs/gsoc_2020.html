    <b>Benchmarks for Network Service Mesh, Istio, Citrix</b>
    <ul>
      <li class="gsoc">
        <b>Description</b>: Network Service Mesh, like other service meshes are
        plagued by the question of adopters asking the question: "what's the
        performance overhead of the service mesh?". Network Service Mesh,
        Linkerd, Istio, Envoy and the list of other service meshes don't have a
        consistent set of performance benchmarks between them. So, even if Envoy
        were to publish performance results, users still wouldn't be able to
        compare overhead between Linkerd and Envoy. The project idea here is to
        build a multi-mesh performance benchmark tool.

    <b>Distributed Load Testing of Service Meshes</b>
    <ul>
      <li class="gsoc">
        <b>Description</b>: Many performance benchmarks are limited to single
        instance load generation (single pod load generator). This limits the
        amount of traffic that can be generated to output of the single machine
        that the benchmark tool runs on in or out of a cluster. Overcoming this
        limitation would allow for more flexible and robust testing. Distributed
        load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without
        losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail
        percentiles. Use Meshery’s interface for supporting different load
        generators (a point of extensibility) to place support for Vegeta.
        Workloads running on service meshes are hit in various ways and
        generally not from the same source. Use of a distributed load generator
        will aid in the testing of service mesh behavior.

        scheduled performance tests. In this, they would have a
        Kubernetes-native experience for leveraging Meshery’s functionality.
        Other functionality like kubectl get meshevents, which should give them

    <ol>
      While small, the Layer5 community represents the largest collection of
      service mesh projects and their maintainers in the world. We build
      projects to provide learning environments, deployment and operational best
      practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, share networking
      opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit
      pushes Layer5 projects forward. New members are always welcome.
