    The Layer5 community is growing at a tremendous rate. No matter the size, we
    know that connection is what makes the Layer5 community different from any
    other community you join. Whether it is your first Layer5 meeting or your
    tenth contribution, as community organizers, we want to make sure you have a
    great time and are able to take advantage of all of the amazing learning,
    contributing, and community that Layer5 has to offer. In the Layer5 mentor
    program, we will match you with an awesome MeshMate so you have a connection
    and guide from the start.

  <h6>Code of Conduct</h6>
  <p class="indent">
    The comfort and safety of Layer5 community members is our priority. You must
    agree to the Code of Conduct to participate in the Layer5 community, and any
    violations of the <a href="/terms/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a> will
    be taken seriously. To report any violations please fill out this incident
    form.
  </p>

  <h6>What to Expect</h6>
  <p class="indent">
    The program pairs experienced Layer5 community members with community
    newcomers to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. There is a lot going in
    the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move fast. MeshMates are
    committed to helping their mentees in identifying an area of the projects to
    engage within, working groups to join, growing their Cloud Native knowledge,
    and network of relationships. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share
    tips on how to have the best community experience possible.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Meshtees are encouraged to get to know their MeshMate as soon as they are
    assigned (MeshMates and Mentees will be introduced in the Layer5 Slack).
    Help your MeshMate understand your current skills, ideal topics of learning,
    and areas of passion. Doing so will help them to point out various aspects
    of projects that you might find your first foothold.
  </p>

  <h6>Meeting Your MeshMate</h6>
  <p class="indent">
    Slack’s video chat or Google Hangouts are both available for your use as
    tools for getting to know one another. While getting acquainted and
    onboarding into the community, we suggest the following goals.
