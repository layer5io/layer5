  <p class="indent">
    The Layer5 community is growing at a tremendous rate. No matter the size, we know that connection is what 
    makes the Layer5 community different from any other community you join. Whether it is your first Layer5 meeting or your tenth 
    contribution, as community organizers, we want to make sure you have a great time and are able to take advantage of all of the 
    amazing learning, contributing, and community that Layer5 has to offer. In the Layer5 mentor program, we will match you with an 
    awesome MeshMate so you have a connection and guide from the start.
  </p>

  <h6>Code of Conduct</h6>
  <p class="indent">
    The comfort and safety of Layer5 community members is our priority. You must agree to the Code of Conduct to participate in the Layer5 community, and any 
    violations of the Code of Conduct will be taken seriously. To report any violations please fill out this incident form.
  </p>

  <h6>What to Expect</h6>
  <p class="indent">
    The program pairs experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. There 
    is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move fast. MeshMates are committed to helping their mentees 
    in identifying an area of the projects to engage within, working groups to join, growing their Cloud Native knowledge, and network 
    of relationships. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share tips on how to have the best community experience possible.
  </p>
  <p class="indent">
    Meshtees are encouraged to get to know their MeshMate as soon as they are assigned (MeshMates and Mentees will be introduced in the 
    Layer5 Slack). Help your MeshMate understand your current skills, ideal topics of learning, and areas of passion. Doing so will help 
    them to point out various aspects of projects that you might find your first foothold. 
  </p>

  <h6>Meeting Your MeshMate</h6>
  <p class="indent">
    Slack’s video chat or Google Hangouts are both available for your use as tools for getting to know one another. While getting acquainted 
    and onboarding into the community, we suggest the following goals.
