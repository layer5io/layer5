On one side, verbose logs, relics of our debugging days, threaten to devour production budgets.  On the other, traces, the Sherlock Holmes of observability, offer targeted insights but come with their own complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signals have different ways to be collected/instrumented. They also have different resource costs to obtain, store, and analyze, while providing different ways to observe the same system. Choosing between them, or all of them, is a game of trade-offs like all other tasks in engineering. In the next sections, we’ll help you make this decision by digging deeper into each signal, starting with the most popular ones: metrics, logs and traces, and then the two new possible signals: application profiles and crash dumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Logpocalypse Looms:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that single log statement you sprinkled in development?  Imagine it bombarded with millions of hits daily in production.  The cost implications are staggering.  Are we clinging to outdated habits, drowning in a sea of irrelevant data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div quote=&quot;Log levels area a Band-Aid, not a cure.&quot; person=&quot;Lee Calcote&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log levels offer some relief, silencing the noise in production.  But what if that critical error gets buried under an avalanche of info logs?  Is there a risk of sacrificing valuable insights for a false sense of cost control?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traces: A Targeted Approach Emerges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traces offer a compelling alternative.  They map a request&amp;#x27;s journey through your system, meticulously recording events and their connections.  This targeted approach inherently generates less data, making them potentially cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing offers the ability to granularly track request segments (spans) as the request is processed across various services. It is hard to introduce later, one reason being third party libraries that are used by the application also need to be instrumented. The cost of distributed tracing can be high, and so, most service mesh tracing systems employ various forms of sampling to capture only a certain portion of the observed traces. When traces are sampled performance overhead and storage costs are reduced, but so is your visibility. The rate at which sampling is done is a balance between the frequency by which traces are captured (typically expressed as a percentage in relation to service request volume). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure: Cost vs. Value Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/comparative-cost-of-observability-signals-75d487120df6091e4dd1ac12618bf9c5.png&quot; class=&quot;image-center-shadow&quot; style=&quot;width:70%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure: a comparative spectrum of value provided by and cost of each pillar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure above presents a visual spectrum that acknowledges that collecting telemetry in production is a compromise between cost in terms of storage and performance (CPU, memory, and request latency) overhead, and the value of information collection, typically in terms of how expressiveness it is or useful it is in solving puzzles of slow or errored responses.
It’s argued that metrics provide the highest value for the smallest investment. Given that some service meshes facilitate distributed tracing, an argument that distributed tracing provides the highest value and can be achieved at low investment (relative to the amount of insight provided). Ideally, your instrumentation allows you to dial back the verbosity levels and sampling rate to facilitate control over your overhead costs vs desired observability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;#x27;t dive into metrics as a signal in this post, but will ackowledge their use and validaty in the converation.  Metrics also represent point in time observations of the state of a system. This differs from logs or traces, which focus on records or information about individual events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Power of Smart Sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all traces are created equal.  Simple sampling techniques can leave you blindsided.  The key lies in dynamic/adaptive tail sampling – a detective sniffing out the real clues in a crime scene, focusing on the most valuable traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Smart Sampling with Jaeger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve established that simple, &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; sampling techniques for traces can leave you blindsided. Imagine a scenario in Jaeger, a popular distributed tracing platform, where every trace has a 10% chance of being captured, regardless of content. Crucial errors with low occurrence might slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where dynamic/adaptive tail sampling, a champion feature of Jaeger, enters the scene, offering a more intelligent approach. Here&amp;#x27;s how it works within the Jaeger ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaeger&amp;#x27;s Collector Takes Center Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;  As traces flow into your Jaeger collector, it doesn&amp;#x27;t make a snap decision about sampling.  Instead, it analyzes key characteristics of each trace using Jaeger&amp;#x27;s robust sampling framework. This might include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Span Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;  Did a particular span within the trace take an exceptionally long time, indicating a potential bottleneck in a specific service?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Tags:&lt;/strong&gt;  Did any spans within the trace contain error tags, suggesting something went wrong?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Names:&lt;/strong&gt;  Was a specific service involved in the trace that&amp;#x27;s known to be error-prone based on historical data?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing the Catch:&lt;/strong&gt;  Based on analysis, the Jaeger collector assigns a sampling probability to each trace.  Traces with characteristics suggesting valuable insights (e.g., slow spans, errors) will have a higher chance of being captured. On the other hand, common, routine traces might be sampled at a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jaeger Detective at Work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of Jaeger&amp;#x27;s dynamic/adaptive tail sampling as a detective sifting through a crime scene. They don&amp;#x27;t blindly collect every span within every trace.  Instead, they prioritize clues based on their potential significance – error tags within a span get captured with a higher probability than a normal database access span in a healthy service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intelligent approach ensures you capture the valuable traces while keeping the cost under control. But even with Jaeger, there are good and bad practices to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Practice: Sampling Everything (Jaeger YAML configuration):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(99, 119, 119);font-style:italic&quot;&gt;# This configuration captures EVERY trace, defeating the purpose of sampling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;sampler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; probabilistic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(247, 140, 108)&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Practice: Prioritize Errors (Jaeger YAML configuration):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(99, 119, 119);font-style:italic&quot;&gt;# This leverages Jaeger&amp;#x27;s ability to identify traces with errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

Here&amp;#x27;s how to leverage it with best practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install the Jaeger Operator:&lt;/strong&gt;  Follow the official guide to install the Jaeger Operator in your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Jaeger CRDs with Sampling Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;  Use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) provided by the operator to configure your Jaeger instance. Within the CRD YAML, define the &lt;code&gt;sampler&lt;/code&gt; section as shown in the good practice example above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailor Sampling for Specific Services:&lt;/strong&gt;  The Jaeger Operator allows granular control over sampling strategies. You can define specific sampling probabilities for individual services within your application landscape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the Basics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaeger&amp;#x27;s dynamic/adaptive tail sampling offers a robust configuration system. You can define custom sampling strategies based on specific service names, tags, or even regular expressions within your traces. This granular control empowers you to tailor the sampling process to your unique application landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaeger: Ideal, or Not Quite?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaeger is a powerful tool for distributed tracing, but it&amp;#x27;s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Here&amp;#x27;s a quick reflection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; Jaeger excels at cost-effective observability with its smart sampling and ease of use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt; While Jaeger offers flexibility, configuration can become complex for intricate setups. Additionally, Jaeger itself requires some infrastructure overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By embracing Jaeger&amp;#x27;s smart sampling techniques and leveraging the Jaeger Tracing Operator for best-practice deployments, you can move beyond the reactive &amp;quot;log everything&amp;quot; mentality and enter a new era of cost-conscious, insightful monitoring. Remember, the ideal tool depends on your specific needs. Explore your options – Jaeger might be your perfect partner, or it might be the first step on your journey to finding the ideal distributed tracing solution for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future of Observability Beckons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of observability isn&amp;#x27;t about logs versus traces.  It&amp;#x27;s about embracing a proactive approach.  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#x27;s time to move beyond the reactive &amp;quot;log everything&amp;quot; mentality.&lt;/strong&gt;  By adopting smarter practices, we can create a future where observability doesn&amp;#x27;t break the bank.  Let&amp;#x27;s ditch the cost-prohibitive logpocalypse and unlock the power of targeted, insightful monitoring. The choice is clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Mythical 10x Engineer]]></title><description><![CDATA[Find a 10x engineer or build a 10x team.]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/community/the-mythical-10x-engineer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/community/the-mythical-10x-engineer</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 May 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/93e8812f83905a8e6ad990a01d66c0bb/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.svg" length="0" type="image/svg+xml"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;The legend of the 10x engineer - a programmer ten times more productive than their peers - has captivated the tech world for years. But is this a badge of honor for a select few, or a recruiting pipe dream? Let&amp;#x27;s dissect the concept to see if it holds water.&lt;p&gt;On the one hand, there&amp;#x27;s no denying vast skill gaps exist. Some engineers possess an uncanny ability to solve problems, architect elegant systems, and write clean, efficient code. Their deep understanding and relentless focus translate to impressive results.  However, is this a tenfold difference?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s where skepticism creeps in. The &amp;quot;10x&amp;quot; is a nebulous term.  Metrics for programmer performance are complex.  Lines of code churned? Bug fixes closed?  These don&amp;#x27;t capture the entire picture.  A single line of genius can be worth weeks of rote coding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the myth often overlooks the power of teamwork.  A talented engineer paired with a brilliant communicator can achieve far more than the sum of their parts.  A supportive team environment that fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing can significantly elevate everyone&amp;#x27;s performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, is the 10x engineer a myth? Not entirely.  There are undoubtedly exceptional engineers who deliver remarkable results. But it&amp;#x27;s likely a spectrum, not a binary. Focusing on building strong, well-rounded teams that leverage individual strengths and create a space for open communication might be a more fruitful approach than chasing the elusive 10x rockstar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s what we can learn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celebrate exceptional skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Recognize and reward engineers who consistently deliver high-quality work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on team dynamics:&lt;/strong&gt; Foster an environment of collaboration and knowledge sharing to elevate everyone&amp;#x27;s game. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware the myth:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#x27;t get caught up in the idea of a single superstar solving all your problems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;By creating a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, you might not find a 10x engineer, but you might just build a 10x team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Simplify Multi-container Application Management with the Docker Meshery Extension]]></title><description><![CDATA[Simplify Multi-container Application Management with the Docker Meshery Extension]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/docker/simplify-multi-container-application-management-with-the-docker-meshery-extension</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/docker/simplify-multi-container-application-management-with-the-docker-meshery-extension</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Layer5 Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/c7a2abd06dcfa5a17ef79309fbcb392e/dockercompose-logo.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience the power and ease of the Docker Meshery Extension.

The primary objectives include identifying bottlenecks, measuring performance, and gaining insights into how the system operates under extreme conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load tests empower developers to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the scalability of the application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify and rectify bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure reliability and robustness of the application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predict system behavior under varying conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; Load Generator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s delve into Meshery, a multi-Cloud Native management plane founded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt;—a community dedicated to open-source initiatives in network management and observability. Meshery aids developers in assessing the performance of their Cloud Native applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meshery boasts a comprehensive set of features, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloud Native Lifecycle Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuration management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting various load generators like HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/projects/nighthawk&quot;&gt;Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt; and its built-in load generator, Meshery facilitates the creation of synthetic HTTP load and enables benchmarking the performance of Cloud Native applications.
Developers can choose their preferred load generator for tests and benefit from the capability to run tests, providing a more comprehensive performance analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Meshery, developers can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage the lifecycle of various &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt; applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct performance tests and compare results between across different &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt; environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply custom or pre-defined configurations to enhance &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt; functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Load Balancing&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing is a critical technique that enhances the responsiveness, reliability, and scalability of applications by efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. In this guide, we&amp;#x27;ll explore various load balancing techniques and algorithms, shedding light on their roles, benefits, and challenges in the context of Kubernetes networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction: The Crucial Role of Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance of internet applications by efficiently managing network traffic. Imagine a grocery store with multiple checkout lines—one open and the others closed. Load balancing is akin to opening all checkout lines,thereby reducing wait times, and improving overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption fig-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/Layer5.e3b47339.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Load Balancing Works:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing involves three main components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Balancer:&lt;/strong&gt; Positioned between users and application servers, it monitors incoming traffic and redirects it to the most suitable server. It can be hardware-based or software-based, with the latter running on existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Servers:&lt;/strong&gt; These servers host applications, receiving traffic from the load balancer and serving requested content to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users:&lt;/strong&gt; End-users access applications through the internet or intranet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user initiates a request, the load balancer evaluates factors such as server capacity, usage rate, and response time to determine the optimal server. This process enhances efficiency and reduces user wait times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Load Balancers: Performance, Reliability, and Scalability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; By distributing workloads evenly, response time and system latency are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; Fault tolerance is enhanced by detecting and removing failed or unhealthy servers,redirecting traffic to functional servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; The system&amp;#x27;s capacity can be horizontally scaled by adding more servers without impacting existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Efficient resource utilization avoids underutilization or overprovisioning of servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Load Balancing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery  serves as a platform for managing various Cloud Native applications . While it doesn&amp;#x27;t directly perform load balancing directly, Meshery allows users to configure and observe load balancing within their chosen Cloud Native Adaptors. Through a unified dashboard, users can customize load balancing settings, monitor relevant metrics, and leverage observability tools to gain insights into the performance and health of load balancing features. Meshery&amp;#x27;s focus is on providing a consistent and user-friendly interface for Cloud Native Lifecycle Management, including load balancing configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/istio&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/linkerd&quot;&gt;Linkerd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul&quot;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/nsm&quot;&gt;Network Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of Load Balancers in Kubernetes: Service, Ingress, and External&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; This basic Kubernetes tactic routes all requests to a service and directs them to matching pods. It&amp;#x27;s suitable for cluster-internal traffic but lacks advanced features like SSL termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Handling external traffic, it routes requests based on rules defined in an ingress resource. It offers more flexibility and functionality, including SSL termination and authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Involving external load balancers from cloud providers (AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer), it provides layer-4 or layer-7 load balancing and high availability. However, it adds complexity and additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges of Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its advantages, load balancing comes with challenges such as the need for careful configuration to address specific application requirements and potential complexities in managing dynamic workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Load Balance Algorithms: Static and Dynamic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Static Load Balancing Algorithms:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round Robin:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributes requests sequentially across servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hash:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributes requests based on a key, such as client IP address or request URL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributes requests randomly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least Connections:&lt;/strong&gt; Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least Response Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Considers active connections and average response time to determine the optimal server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least Bandwidth:&lt;/strong&gt; Routes requests to the server with the least traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right Load Balancer: Tips and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider factors like application needs, performance requirements, and scalability when selecting a load balancer—whether hardware, software, or a combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Empowering Applications with Optimal Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing is a powerful technique that significantly impacts the performance, reliability, and scalability of applications. Whether distributing workloads based on static or dynamic algorithms, choosing the right load balancing strategy is crucial for delivering an exceptional user experience and optimizing resources. As technologies evolve, staying informed about the latest load balancing practices ensures continuous improvement in application delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comparing Meshery Models and Meshery Designs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Understanding the difference between Meshery Models and Meshery Designs]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/comparing-meshery-models-and-meshery-designs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/comparing-meshery-models-and-meshery-designs</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/849957f6f940bb09802455b7e7411be8/five-legos.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Meshery, two key concepts play a pivotal role in managing infrastructure and deployments: Meshery Models and Meshery Designs. Understanding their difference and their similarities will greatly increase your benefit from these two powerful, systems management paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt;Meshery Models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt; Meshery Designs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/designs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meshery Designs&lt;/a&gt; are the practical implementations based on Meshery Models. They represent declarations of your infrastructure deployments, customized according to specific use cases, environments, and requirements. Meshery Designs allow you to create, manage, and deploy complex architectures seamlessly, leveraging the power and flexibility of Meshery Models as their foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/five-legos-94699efabf99f5f9208a161510500a42.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meshery Models (similar to Lego bricks)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/a&gt; are standardized packages that bundle components and characterize their relationships. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/components&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Components&lt;/a&gt; are often representative of infrastructure, but can, in fact, represent anything (see semantically meaningful vs non-semantically meaingful components). Models uniformly wrap each component with a layer of metadata therein standardizing all entities (infrasturcture or otherwise) under a common interface much in the same way that the Industrial Revolution offered consistency of parts and interchangability of machinery, Meshery Components become fundamental building blocks. Components are like standard Lego bricks, window pieces, wheels that all snap together - or don&amp;#x27;t - depending upon way in which they relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As versioned and portable pacakges, Models provide a structured, reusable, and extensible way to represent infrastructure components and their relationships, going beyond just code. This enables a more flexible and adaptable approach to modeling complex systems. are powerful Relationships and policies. contain Components cannot be directly used to build something complete on their own, but are standardized and reused across different Lego sets (instructions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; Building blocks for infrastructure definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Describe how to manage specific infrastructure types and their interactions.&lt;img data-file-id=&quot;2445161&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; src=&quot;/static/five-legos-94699efabf99f5f9208a161510500a42.png&quot; style=&quot;border:0px;width:300px;height:223px;margin:0px&quot; width=&quot;300; box-shadow: none;&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt; Define properties, capabilities, and relationships for infrastructure components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability:&lt;/strong&gt; Not directly deployable, but used as building blocks within Designs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be packaged and shared for others to use in their Designs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery Models are like the individual Lego bricks - they define the building blocks for infrastructure with specific characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meshery Designs (similar to Lego instructions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery Designs provide a collaborative blueprint for building a specific model using Lego bricks (Meshery Models). Designs define the structure and placement of the bricks to achieve the desired outcome. Desan be shared, versioned, and used as reference for building the same model.&lt;/p&gt;In essence:&lt;img data-file-id=&quot;2445165&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;/static/five-instructions-f61829b7e0796144ba049dc458f6ea20.png&quot; style=&quot;border:0px;width:179px;height:300px;margin:0px&quot; width=&quot;179;&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; Collaborative documents for infrastructure and application deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Describe the desired state of infrastructure for a specific deployment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt; Use components (based on Models) and relationships to define your infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability:&lt;/strong&gt; Designs are the deployable unit in Meshery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be exported, versioned, shared, and published for reuse by others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery Designs are like the Lego instructions - they use Models (like bricks) to lay out the specific infrastructure deployment plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analogy:&lt;/strong&gt; Think of Models as Lego bricks (defining types of pieces) and Designs as Lego instructions (defining how to build something specific).&lt;/p&gt; In summary, Meshery Models serve as the theoretical frameworks, while Meshery Designs translate these frameworks into tangible deployments, enabling you to design, deploy, and manage your infrastructure efficiently within the cloud and cloud native ecosystem.&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layer5 at KubeCon EU 2024]]></title><description><![CDATA[Layer5 projects on stage at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon EU 2024]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/layer5-at-kubecon-eu-2024</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/layer5-at-kubecon-eu-2024</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ritik Saxena]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 20 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/674405e0d6e0490ebefae7e93a644744/kubeconeu2024.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;Happy KubeCon week!

With Docker as the most popular container engine and image format, but not the only runtime or format, the need for a standardized format to store and distribute container images became apparent and is why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencontainers.org&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OCI) image format comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCI was established as a community-driven initiative to create open standards for container formats and runtimes. Its goal is to promote interoperability and ensure that containers can be used across different platforms and runtime environments. One of the key components of the OCI initiative is the OCI image format, which has been widely adopted by container registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have container registries have embraced the OCI format? How does Meshery, a popular internal developer platform, leverage this format for pushing and pulling design patterns? By understanding the benefits of OCI format for container registries and Meshery&amp;#x27;s support for it, we can gain valuable insights into the advantages of using this standardized format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Container Registries Use OCI Format&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Container registries play a crucial role in the container ecosystem, serving as repositories for storing and distributing container images. These images are the building blocks of containerized applications, containing everything needed to run an application, from the code to the dependencies and configurations. In recent years, container registries have widely adopted the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format as the standard for packaging and distributing container images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of OCI Format&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OCI format by container registries offers several compelling benefits. Firstly, the OCI format provides a standardized and vendor-neutral way to package and distribute container images. This standardization ensures that images created using one container runtime can be run using a different runtime without any compatibility issues. This portability not only enhances interoperability but also encourages collaboration and innovation within the container ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the OCI format promotes transparency and openness. It allows developers and users to inspect and understand the contents of a container image easily. By providing a clear structure for storing metadata and file system layers, the OCI format enables greater visibility into the image&amp;#x27;s composition, making it easier to identify potential security vulnerabilities or licensing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interoperability with Different Container Runtimes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key reason why container registries prefer the OCI format is its compatibility with various container runtimes. Since container runtimes are responsible for executing the container images, it is crucial to have a format that can work seamlessly across different runtime environments. The OCI format achieves this by defining a set of specifications that are implemented by various container runtimes like Docker, containerd, and CRI-O. This compatibility ensures that container images stored in OCI format can be executed on different runtimes, giving developers the flexibility to choose the runtime that best suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security and Trustworthiness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is a top concern for container registries, and the OCI format offers robust security features. By adhering to the OCI format, container registries can leverage the security mechanisms provided by OCI specifications. These mechanisms include content-addressable storage, which ensures that the integrity of the image is maintained throughout its lifecycle, and digital signatures, which enable image verification and establish trust between the registry and the consumers. The use of the OCI format adds an additional layer of trustworthiness to container images, assuring users that the images have not been tampered with and come from a trusted source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Meshery Design Patterns Utilize OCI Format&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introduction to Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery, an open-source service mesh management plane, has rapidly gained popularity among developers and operators for its ability to simplify and streamline the deployment, management, and observability of service meshes. One of the key features that sets Meshery apart is its utilization of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format for pushing and pulling design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advantages of Pushing and Pulling Design Patterns in OCI Format&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the OCI format for design patterns offers several advantages for Meshery users. Firstly, it ensures that design patterns can be easily shared and reused across different container runtimes, regardless of the specific implementation details. This interoperability simplifies the process of deploying applications on various platforms, eliminating the need for time-consuming modifications and customizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the OCI format enhances security and trustworthiness by providing a standardized and verifiable way to package and distribute design patterns. By utilizing cryptographic signing, developers can ensure the integrity and authenticity of the design patterns they push and pull from container registries. This prevents tampering and reduces the risk of running malicious or compromised design patterns, enhancing the overall security posture of applications deployed using Meshery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of the OCI format is its ability to encapsulate not only the application code but also the underlying dependencies and runtime environment. This self-contained nature simplifies the process of distributing and maintaining design patterns, as all the necessary components are bundled together.

Five months ago, I was a new contributor with zero knowledge of cloud native technologies roaming through their Github looking to make my first contribution. In this article, I’ll share my journey contributing to Layer5 as a designer. I’ll also share insights I hope new contributors find useful as they navigate their open source journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Discovery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first learned about Layer5 through the LFX Mentorship. I stumbled upon a tweet by &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/anita-ihuman&quot;&gt;Anita Ihuman&lt;/a&gt; announcing that &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; was accepting mentees for a design-related project. I had always been looking to make design contributions to open source projects but it was hard finding one. So, this was a great opportunity for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;My First Contribution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, my first contribution to Layer5 had nothing to do with design. It was a writing task. They needed a blog that highlighted &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/blog/community/on-the-importance-of-github-stars&quot;&gt;the importance of GitHub stars&lt;/a&gt; to a project. The purpose of the blog was to boost the project’s visibility by encouraging more people to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meshery/meshery&quot;&gt;give Meshery a star&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub. Since I had some experience writing, I volunteered to write the blog. It was a bit more tasking than I had anticipated but with the help of the community, I was able to work through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Making Design Contributions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I noticed there were a bunch of open issues to design badges for users and contributors. I requested to work on one of the badges and got assigned. I didn’t initially have edit access to the community Figma file so I struggled to get assets like the logo and font to create the design. I eventually found them in the local branch of Layer5 that I had cloned earlier on my PC. Turned out that all the resources I needed to complete that task were available to me; I just needed to know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was my first design contribution. Since then I’ve designed more badges and contributed in many other ways besides design. For instance, I worked on documentation and helped with marketing and community management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How I&amp;#x27;ve Benefited&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a non-exhaustive summary of how contributing to Layer5 has benefited me:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autonomy&lt;/strong&gt; - I’ve learned to own my process and see tasks from start to finish. When I volunteered to write that first blog, I thought I’d do just the writing part and someone else would get it up on the website. I didn’t realize that I would have to clone a repository, learn to use Git CMD, make commits, learn Markdown, and raise a pull request. These were all foreign to me and I was doing them for the first time. It was a great learning opportunity and I’m grateful for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Presentation&lt;/strong&gt; - We hold weekly meetings where contributors share what they’re working on and receive feedback. Presenting at these meetings has taught me to not just show my work, but to talk about it. I’m not a great orator so this was challenging for me at first but I’ve noticed that I’m getting more confident with each presentation I make. I’m gradually learning how to clearly articulate my thought process and have a valid justification for any route I choose to take to complete a task.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&lt;/strong&gt; - Making design contributions has helped improve the quality of my work. Sometimes, I’d nail a design on my first try. Other times, I may have to iterate several times before I get it right. The important thing is that I end up producing high-quality work. I’ve also learned to detach myself from my work, be objective, and gracefully accept constructive criticism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt; - For the first time, I get to work together with developers and other designers. Thanks to Layer5.  I’m also learning to use communication and collaboration tools like Slack, GitHub, and ClickUp.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How You Can Contribute to Layer5&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience clearly shows that you don’t necessarily need to know anything about coding or cloud native technologies to contribute to Layer5 projects. Are you a designer, technical writer, community manager, or digital marketer? There are several ways to contribute. You can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on improving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.layer5.io&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design new website pages or improve the UX of existing ones,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warmly welcome newcomers to the community and offer support,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give constructive feedback during the weekly meetings,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk about Layer5 and invite your friends to use and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meshery&quot;&gt;star Meshery&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write articles for our blog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list is endless. My advice is that you do not box yourself. Don’t feel that because you’re a designer, your contributions will be strictly design-related. If you want to make impactful contributions, pay attention to the needs of the community/project and help where you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more guidance on contributing to Layer5, check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/community/newcomers&quot;&gt;newcomer’s guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- &lt;div to=&quot;https://layer5.io/community/members/victoria-nduka&quot;&gt;Victoria Nduka&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot; on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Slack Channel&lt;/a&gt; and one of us will reach out to you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kubernetes 1.29 Highlights, Features, and Deprecations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Release Notes: What changed in Kubernetes 1.29?]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/kubernetes-new.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the final Kubernetes release of 2023, Kubernetes 1.29 is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/&quot;&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt; of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/cloud-native-performance&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt;. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kubernetes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of enhancements tracked in this release (72), you need to be aware that a number of these are code freezes or deprecations in 1.29. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, and important deprecations, so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s breakdown new K8s features between networking and security categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Networking in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io&quot;&gt;Gateway API reaches 1.0&lt;/a&gt; [Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway API has reached v1.0 in between Kubernetes 1.28 and 1.29. The Gateway API is the eventual successor to the Ingress API and significantly augments the Service API. The Kubernetes Service API is one of the oldest and most used APIs in Kubernetes. The Service API, in fact, was present in the very first public commit of Kubernetes in 2014, and almost everyone who deploys workloads in Kubernetes ends up using Services. Nearly ten years later in 2024, While Service API offers a kitchen sink full of functionality, it’s nearly ten year old design is limiting what can be done in Kubernetes networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway API takes a fresh approach in offering expressive, extensible, and role-oriented interfaces. Gateway API is expressive and extensible in that it offers core support for advanced traffic management (like traffic weighting, header-based matching) that is only possible through customizations in Ingress API. Gateway API is role-oriented in that it defines three main roles: infrastructure provider, cluster operator, and application developer, who need to work together to use and configure Kubernetes service networking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753&quot;&gt;Sidecar Containers&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new sidecar feature enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support. The lack of native support has caused some usage friction, which this enhancement aims to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new feature adds a new restartPolicy field to init containers that is available when the SidecarContainers feature gate is enabled. The field is optional and, if set, the only valid value is Always. Setting this field changes the behavior of init containers as follows: The container restarts if it exits. Any subsequent init container starts immediately after the startupProbe has successfully completed instead of waiting for the restartable init container to exit. The resource usage calculation changes for the pod as restartable init container resources are now added to the sum of the resource requests by the main containers. Pod termination continues to only depend on the main containers. An init container with a restartPolicy of Always (named a sidecar) won’t prevent the pod from terminating after the main containers exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers (init containers with an Always restart policy), the kubelet will delay sending the TERM signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated. The sidecar containers will be terminated in the reverse order they are defined in the Pod spec. This ensures that sidecar containers continue serving the other containers in the Pod until they are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior of this beta capability in 1.29 is that sidecar containers that have a &lt;code&gt;PreStop&lt;/code&gt; hook will be notified when the Pod has begun terminating by executing the &lt;code&gt;PreStop&lt;/code&gt; hook. Once the last primary container terminates, the last started sidecar container is notified by sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt; signal. The next sidecar (in reverse order) is notified by sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt; signal after the previous sidecar container terminates. This continues until all sidecar containers have terminated, or the Pod’s termination grace period expires. In the latter case, all remaining containers are notified by a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a fixed grace period of 2 seconds and finally terminated. The Pod will be terminated after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that slow termination of a main container will also delay the termination of the sidecar containers. If the grace period expires before the termination process is complete, the Pod may enter emergency termination. In this case, all remaining containers in the Pod will be terminated simultaneously with a short grace period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the Pod has a &lt;code&gt;preStop&lt;/code&gt; hook that exceeds the termination grace period, emergency termination may occur. In general, if you have used &lt;code&gt;preStop&lt;/code&gt; hooks to control the termination order without sidecar containers, you can now remove them and allow the kubelet to manage sidecar termination automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4006-transition-spdy-to-websockets&quot;&gt;Transition SPDY to WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change aims to deprecate SPDY in favor of WebSockets for Kubernetes API server communications. WebSockets provide a more modern and scalable protocol that can improve the overall reliability and maintainability of Kubernetes communications. This can enhance security by making sure that the communication protocols used by Kubernetes are robust and well-supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These general enhancements contribute to a more secure and efficient Kubernetes environment. By improving Kubernetes’ underlying reliability, performance, and operational control, the above features lay the groundwork for a more secure infrastructure platform capable of hosting sensitive and critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Security in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2535-ensure-secret-pulled-images&quot;&gt;Ensure Secret Pulled Images&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Container images often contain sensitive components, making the security of image pull operations critical. The new alpha feature makes sure that images are always pulled using Kubernetes secrets of the Pod using them. This is important when Kubelet pulls an image for one Pod and another Pod is pointing to the same image. Up until now, the second Pod’s image request did not need authentication since it still used the first one’s credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access. By securing the image pull process, this enhancement prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with container images, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031&quot;&gt;SignedSigning Release Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume&lt;/code&gt; has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2799-reduction-of-secret-based-service-account-token&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to “Bound Service Account Token Improvements” enhancement and narrowing the scope of service account tokens, this improvement seeks to reduce the reliance on long-lived secret-based service account tokens. By limiting the use of these tokens, the potential attack surface is significantly diminished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move aligns with the broader industry trend of short-lived, just-in-time credentials that minimize the chances of token leakage leading to unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3221-structured-authorization-configuration&quot;&gt;Structured Authentication Configuration&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the authorization counterpart, Kubernetes 1.29 provides another alpha feature for structured configuration for authentication mechanisms. This enhancement offers users a more maintainable and secure approach to managing authentication, allowing administrators to implement complex authentication schemes more efficiently and with less room for error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new enhancement, it is now possible to configure multiple OIDC providers, clients, and validation rules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endeavour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal. Dign into more details about deprecation, removals, and the latest changes in the 1.29 &lt;a href=&quot;https://relnotes.k8s.io/&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Layer5 community and all of the CNCF projects that its contributors steward, thank you to everyone who participated in this Kubernetes release, and congratulations! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#x27;s ahead for Kubernetes in 2024?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI/MLOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI came into the world with a big splash this year and helmsman, Kubernetes, is here helping navigate the AI waters. While some people suggest that the CNCF and Kubernetes ecosystem is in catch up mode in context of GenAI, they perhaps, forget that OpenAI is running a 7,500 node Kubernetes cluster in the development and hosting of GPT-3, CLIP, DALL·E, and research on other models. Where I think that Kubernetes and the CNCF can improve is in embracing and enabling AI/ML as a forerunner of our workload use cases. The CNCF has a massive developer ecosystem that will that can be enabled with MLOps and new model training projects like Kubeflow with its Kartib and KFServing sub-projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking past YAML&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DZone’s annual trend report on Kubernetes in the Enterprise has 55% of respondents identifying &amp;quot;Maintaining YAML files” as one of the more significant, ongoing pain-points in their experience with Kubernetes. In 2024, I’m looking forward to CNCF projects like Meshery addressing this pain-point with &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshmap&quot;&gt;a visual designer for Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; resource and workflow configuration. The inability for some developers to either be capable of or have time to comprehend the intricacies of their virtualized applications by staring at endless lines of YAML is poised to significantly improve in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Navigating Hacktoberfest]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to have a great Hacktoberfest experience and get the most out of participating]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/open-source/navigating-hacktoberfest</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/open-source/navigating-hacktoberfest</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/7e7878515bc5a64e27221318931fe2c6/layer5-hacktoberfest-2023.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the leaves begin to turn and the air grows crisp, it can only mean one thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.com&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; is here! This annual celebration of open source, hosted by Digital Ocean, invites contributors from all over the world to participate in a month-long extravaganza of code contributions. While the allure of limited-edition swag may be enticing, it&amp;#x27;s essential to approach Hacktoberfest with a mindset focused on quality, respect for maintainers, and a commitment to long-term community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 has a long history of participating in Hacktoberfest. 2023 is no different. Our annual &lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest kickoff and prep event&lt;/a&gt; (be sure to join) is tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Purposeful Participation: Beyond Swag Chasing and Profile Building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you embark on your Hacktoberfest journey, take a moment to reflect on your motivation. Are you here solely for the swag, just for the green boxes in your GitHub profile, or do you genuinely want to make a meaningful contribution to a project, learn, grow, and make new friends in the process? Embrace the opportunity to forge lasting connections and dive deeper into topics that resonate with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Quality Over Quantity: Making a Lasting Impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a flurry of pull requests may be impressive, maintainers value contributions that add genuine value. Think beyond code and consider how your unique skills—whether in design, organization, or other areas can enrich the project. Open Source thrives on meaningful contributions, so let&amp;#x27;s aim to make a tangible difference, rather than settling for mediocrity. You will grow in the process and so will the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-1yeq4hm-0 bwvwmu blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;blockquote-quote&quot;&gt;When you are clear about what motivates you, each contribution you make will help you achieve your goals, because you will be working on projects that are aligned with your values.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;blockquote-person&quot;&gt;— Lee Calcote&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;blockquote-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Guidelines Aren&amp;#x27;t Optional: Respecting the Playbook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That CONTRIBUTING.md file? It&amp;#x27;s not there for decoration. Treat it as your playbook, providing guidance for equitable collaboration. Ignoring these guidelines is akin to rearranging someone&amp;#x27;s furniture without permission. Established protocols are crucial, especially in projects with numerous contributors. They help navigate the intricacies of collaborative development. As an example, there is a full set of contributig docs written for Meshery - one for each component:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-gitflow&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery using git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/meshery-windows&quot;&gt;Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Build and Release (CI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cypress&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery&amp;#x27;s End-to-End Tests using Cypress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-adapters&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Adapters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docker-extension&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Docker Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-server&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-models&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-error&quot;&gt;How to write MeshKit compatible errors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui-notification-center&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery UI - Notification Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docs&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide&quot;&gt;Meshery CLI Contributing Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Upholding a Safe Environment: The Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect, collaboration, and kindness are the bedrock of Open Source. The Code of Conduct is non-negotiable, ensuring a secure and inclusive space for all contributors. Reporting mechanisms are in place to uphold these principles. As contributors, it is our duty to champion a culture of respect and security, nurturing an environment where creativity and innovation flourish. The &lt;a href=&quot;/community/handbook&quot;&gt;Layer5 Community Handbook&lt;/a&gt; offers an excellent reference for our community&amp;#x27;s culture norms and practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Engaging Beyond Code: Fostering Holistic Development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t confine yourself to a GitHub profile. Engage in meaningful discussions, participate in webinars, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.layer5.io&quot;&gt;open discussions&lt;/a&gt;. Be a mentor and seek mentorship. Open Source offers a wealth of opportunities for comprehensive growth. While coding skills undoubtedly benefit, the real lessons often lie in understanding people and their diverse perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Compassion Over Code: Recognizing Maintainer Burnout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/handbook/repository-overview&quot;&gt;Maintainers&lt;/a&gt; are the unsung heroes of the open-source world, often overwhelmed by the Hacktoberfest influx. Your seemingly &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; pull request may be the tipping point. Recognize their efforts and respect their capacity. Some projects may not actively seek new contributions, and that&amp;#x27;s perfectly valid. Begin by identifying projects explicitly welcoming newcomers, tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Alayer5labs+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;good first issue&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;help wanted&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. The Virtue of Patience: Embracing the Long Game&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source is a marathon, not a sprint. Feedback may take time, and collaboration may be challenging. Patience is the glue that holds this ecosystem together. Cultivate it as a fundamental habit in your contributor journey. The Layer5 &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members&quot;&gt;community members&lt;/a&gt; invest time, patience, understanding and offer endless hours of support to our contributors. Stick around and benefit. In turn, offer to help others. There&amp;#x27;s little better way to learn, than through teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Humility and Gratitude: The Essence of Meaningful Contributions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, a meaningful contribution is its own reward. Swag and a profile boost is a delightful bonus, not the end goal. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and learn from your experiences. As you recognize that you are part of a much larger movement, we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/community/layer5-recognition-program&quot;&gt;recognize our contributors and users milestones&lt;/a&gt; each step of the way. Earn any number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://badges.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Layer5 badges&lt;/a&gt; as you grow with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Earn a Badge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earn a Hacktoberfest Contributor badge by contributing to Layer5 projects during this Hacktoberfest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/hacktoberfest-contributor-0c87d6b9edd34f4c7ac267254ac44dc4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Join Layer5&amp;#x27;s Hacktoberfest Event&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption&quot; style=&quot;width:80%&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/hacktoberfest-2023-with-layer5-d75ad4f9d2094005dd4e683555130e23.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;display:flex;gap:2rem&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest Prep 2023: Easing into CNCF Open Source Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DATE: September 29, 2023&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIME: 3PM UTC | 10AM Central | 8:30PM IST&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EVENT: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.layer5.io/community&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Open GitHub Issues by Label:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hacktoberfest&amp;quot; issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;help wanted&amp;quot; issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Alayer5labs+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;good first issue&amp;quot; issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacktoberfest is an opportunity for transformation, a time when contributors and maintainers can connect on a deeper level. Let&amp;#x27;s be the contributors that maintainers celebrate, rather than dread. Whether maintainers actively seek contributions or focus on internal tasks, respect their choices. Remember, we&amp;#x27;re all weaving the rich tapestry of the open-source community, and together, we&amp;#x27;re contributing to something far greater than a month-long treasure hunt. So, dive in, make a splash, and keep coming back for more than just the loot. Happy Hacking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unlocking the Power of WebAssembly in Service Mesh Management]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a short summary of my blog post.

Maybe someone has even asked you to star their repository. If you&amp;#x27;ve ever wondered how much of an impact your star could make on their project, you&amp;#x27;re in the right place. Let&amp;#x27;s explore what GitHub Stars are and explore the significant role they play in boosting a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are GitHub Stars?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub stars are like virtual thumbs-up or bookmarks that you can give to projects you like on the GitHub platform. They&amp;#x27;re a way to show that you find a project interesting, useful, or valuable. When you star a project, when you star a project, it&amp;#x27;s represented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meshery/meshery/stargazers&quot;&gt;stargazers&lt;/a&gt; section of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stars are one of the key metrics that GitHub uses to track and identify trending projects on its platform. When a repository gains a significant number of stars within a relatively short period, it can be an indicator that the project is gaining popularity, and consequently, qualifies as a &amp;quot;trending project&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s how GitHub uses stars to track trending projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Activity&lt;/strong&gt; -
GitHub monitors the rate at which repositories are being starred. Projects that receive a sudden surge of stars are likely to catch the attention of GitHub&amp;#x27;s algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Interval&lt;/strong&gt; -
GitHub takes into account the time frame within which stars are accumulated. Projects that gain stars rapidly in a short span of time are considered for trending status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Comparison&lt;/strong&gt; -
Trending repositories are often determined based on a comparison with their usual star activity. If a repository&amp;#x27;s star activity significantly exceeds its typical rate, it might be flagged as trending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; -
While rapid stars are important, consistent activity also matters. Projects that sustain their increased star activity over time are more likely to be recognized as trending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a repository meets these criteria, it might be highlighted on GitHub&amp;#x27;s Trending page or other curated sections of the platform. This visibility can attract even more attention and stars, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the project&amp;#x27;s popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Effect of Stars on a Project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starring a project on GitHub does not directly impact the project’s functionality, but it can have several positive effects which include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visibility&lt;/strong&gt; -
Starring a project increases its visibility. Projects with more stars tend to appear higher in search results, making it easier for others to discover and contribute to the project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Engagement&lt;/strong&gt; -
A higher number of stars can attract more contributors, users, and potential collaborators. It indicates that the project has generated interest and resonates with others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt; -
For project maintainers and contributors, seeing their project receive stars can be motivating. It shows that their work is appreciated and valued by the community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition&lt;/strong&gt; - Starring a project is a way for users to acknowledge and recognize the effort put into it. It’s a form of social validation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributor Potential&lt;/strong&gt; - Potential contributors might use the number of stars a project has as a signal of the project’s importance and popularity. A well-started project might attract developers looking for projects to contribute to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback and Support&lt;/strong&gt; - Starring can also serve as a lightweight way for users to express their support for the project or to keep track of projects they find interesting even if they don’t actively contribute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, starring a project helps create a positive cycle where visibility leads to engagement, engagement leads to contributions, and contributions lead to a stronger project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Star a Repository&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starring a repository is a simple two-step process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; On &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meshery/meshery&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, navigate to the main page of the repository.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; At the top-right corner of the page, click Star.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/before-5af3f194d9e1fbc380e882ef34e9f8fd.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before adding a star&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;display:flex;justify-content:center&quot;&gt; This is what a project will look like after you have starred it: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/after-20552f5c81a0de6fb0b053f6f9cb0f51.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding a star&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five Needs Your Stars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand how much impact stars can make, take a moment to help &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/five/vol1/mascot-five-adventure-github-stars.pdf&quot;&gt;Five on his Cloud Native journey&lt;/a&gt;.

This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start&quot;&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt; on your local machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Create a Service Account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named &lt;code&gt;my-service-account&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Create a ClusterRole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#x27;s create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt; that has read-only access to Pods and Services:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

with the ClusterRole &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt;. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role-binding&lt;/code&gt; that associates the Service Account &lt;code&gt;my-service-account&lt;/code&gt; with the ClusterRole &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the &lt;code&gt;Subjects&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RoleRef&lt;/code&gt; sections, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kubernetes clusters&lt;/a&gt;. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Install Meshery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the official Meshery &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Access MeshMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://playground.meshery.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the &amp;quot;Generate Map&amp;quot; button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster&amp;#x27;s architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster&amp;#x27;s lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Changing Meshery Release Channels]]></title><description><![CDATA[Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes being added regularly.

To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; How release channels offer subscription &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release Channels offers a subscription where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery. However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it&amp;#x27;s important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It&amp;#x27;s recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(255, 203, 139)&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;stable-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;edge-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel set stable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Switching between Release Channels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we&amp;#x27;ll cover both methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Meshconfig?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the &lt;code&gt;~/.meshery/config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl version&lt;/code&gt;. If you don&amp;#x27;t have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl&quot;&gt;Meshery documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create new Meshery config.yaml file &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-language=bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context create [context-name]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;Example: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes &lt;/code&gt;&lt;li&gt; To view the newly created meshery context use &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context view &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;context-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery.

Many things are there that you may not know during joining the community but you learn along the journey and there is no fear in that. The thing is you can&amp;#x27;t set back and leave if you are unable to crack something. Learn and come back strong. This is community , this is Layer5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
