Passionate Backend Developer with an interest in microservices and cloud-native ecosystems. Constantly learning new things based on interest & curiosity and trying to give back as much in open-source. Other than that, I love solving algorithm problems. A side note about me would be that, once upon a time, I fell in love with mathematics and physics, which still is an ongoing affair.","image_path":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/52ea4/ashish-tiwari.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/b7279/ashish-tiwari.jpg 125w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/db7ba/ashish-tiwari.jpg 250w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/52ea4/ashish-tiwari.jpg 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/05980/ashish-tiwari.webp 125w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/67c59/ashish-tiwari.webp 250w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/e3dbb/ashish-tiwari.webp 500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":1119}},"extension":"jpg","publicURL":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/ashish-tiwari.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/community/members/ashish-tiwari"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4047814605","7929417"]}
