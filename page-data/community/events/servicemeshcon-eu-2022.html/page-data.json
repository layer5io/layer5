Confused as to whether self-published, performance benchmarks are trustworthy or simply biased marketing in disguise? Measurement data may not provide a clear and simple picture of how well those applications are performing from a business point of view, a characteristic desired in metrics that are used as key performance indicators. Behold MeshMark: a performance index that provides you with the ability to weigh the value vs overhead of your cloud native environment. Convert performance measurements into insights about the value of individual, cloud native application networking functions. Join us as we distill a variety of microarchitecture performance signals and application key performance indicators into a simple scale.
