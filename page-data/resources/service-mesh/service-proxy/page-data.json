The service proxy allows applications to send and receive messages as method calls via a channel. Service proxy connections can be created as needed or persist open connections to facilitate pooling. Applications are oblivious to the data plane's existence. As applications conduct service-to-service calls, service proxies are transparently inserted. Inbound (ingress) and outbound (egress) cluster network traffic are handled by data planes. Whether traffic is entering the mesh (ingressing) or leaving the mesh (egressing), application service traffic is directed first to the service proxy for handling. In Istio, traffic is transparently intercepted using iptables rules and redirected to the service proxy.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Remember that Pilot configures traffic policy and service proxies implement it. The data plane is a collection of service proxies. Service proxies are responsible for health checks, routing, load balancing, authentication, authorization, and the production of observable signals by intercepting every packet in the request. As the service may change from location to location, proxies provide indirection so that clients may point to the same location (e.g., proxy.example.com), representing a permanent reference.

Envoy's runtime configuration has always been API-driven, allowing it to drain and hot reload its own process with an old configuration with a new process and new configuration (displacing itself). Envoy achieves hot reloading of its processes by shared memory and communication through a Unix Domain Socket (UDS), in a manner that resembles GitHub's tool for zero-downtime HAProxy reloads.

The gRPC-JSON transcoder functionality allows a client to send HTTP/1.1 requests with a JSON payload to Envoy, which translates the request into the corresponding gRPC call and subsequently translates the response message back into JSON.
