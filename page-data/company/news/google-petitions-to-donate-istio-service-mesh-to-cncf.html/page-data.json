Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement.

Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments.
