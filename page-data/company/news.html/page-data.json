Kubernetes providers in the program certify their products for various types of AI workloads.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n quote=\"It starts with a simple focus on the kind of things you really need to make AI workloads work well on Kubernetes, Such as Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) across GPUs, TPUs, and all of the different types of AI hardware.\"\n person=\"Chris Aniszczyk\"\n title=\"CTO, CNCF\"\n/>\n\nCNCF membership is squarely in support, Anisczyck said. For example, “Google’s obviously interested in this because they offer their TPUs, and they saw the success of what happened with the original Kubernetes conformance program, which attracted a lot of people to the platform.”\n\nRed Hat booth staff confirmed their plans to implement the conformance program and map their version of Kubernetes, OpenShift, to leading AI hardware, including CPUs, TPUs, and IBM’s new Tellum II mainframe processor. \n\nMissing from the list of conformance program supporters is NVIDIA. “They’re not on the list, but they don’t really have a product that would qualify,” Aniszczyk said. \n\nOther hot topics at this year’s KubeCon North America among the approximately **9,000 attendees** and **300 exhibitors** included observability, security, platform engineering, and configuration management. \n\nCNCF leadership celebrated the 10th anniversary of CNCF at the event, noting that they have nearly **300,000 contributors** worldwide contributing to more than **230 projects**, representing **190 countries**, making CNCF among the largest open source communities.\n\nCNCF announced during their conference keynote that 10 vendors are already AI conformant, including Google Cloud, Apprenda, Red Hat, Rancher, Canonical, IBM, Samsung, Heptio, Microsoft Azure, and Stackpoint Cloud.\n\nCNCF distinguishes among the various resource requirements for different types of AI workloads: model training, inference processing, and running agents. \n\n---\n\n## **Approaches to Providing AI Infrastructure**\n\nEveryone is familiar with the offerings of the large hyperscalers for cloud computing as well as for AI workloads. But some vendors are taking a different approach.\n\n**Vultr** , for example, is competing with the major cloud provider by offering a wide array of hardware options for hosting AI workloads, including AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, virtual CPUs, bare metal, and Kubernetes.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n quote=\"Vultr is an AI infrastructure specialist, Our core platform is a public cloud platform. We’re the functional equivalent of a hyperscaler. We are an alternative to AWS, GCP, or Azure, with the same global reach.\"\n person=\"Kevin Cochrane\"\n title=\"CMO, Vultr\"\n/>\n\n“We are also one of the first to start specializing in AI infrastructure, the first one taking GPUs from NVIDIA. And most recently, the first to market with AMD GPUs. So currently, we’re the only global platform that offers a choice between NVIDIA and AMD,” Cochrane added. \n\n**Mirantis**, on the other hand, offers a full software stack private cloud solution for smaller organizations running their own GPUs. Mirantis software builds and manages private GPU clouds for their customers, said Dom Wilde, General Manager, Core Products. \n\nTheir customers “are trying to figure out how to deliver monetized services around GPU technology. It started with GPU as a service, where we are helping companies rent some GPU capacity that is notoriously hard to get ahold of,” Wilde said.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n quote=\"Private GPU deployments also support data and application sovereignty, which we recognize as an opportunity to be a little disruptive around the hyperscalers, We help these companies reduce time to monetization for their GPUs and offer them expertise that can be difficult to obtain.\"\n person=\"Dom Wilde\"\n title=\"General Manager, Core Products\"\n/>\n\n---\n\n## **AI Agents, Microservices and Service Meshes**\n\nWhether AI agents and microservices are the same thing was a common topic of discussion in the conference sessions as well as on the exhibit floor. The consensus appears to be that they have much in common.\n\nIn their sponsored keynote, **Solo.io** compared AI agents to microservices, highlighting network communication with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and the agent-to-agent (A2A) communication protocol as needing a service mesh for security and reliability in coordinating and exchanging data in multi-agent solutions. \n\n**Buoyant**, the company behind the LinkerD service mesh, agrees. They announced LinkerD for AI agents at the conference, saying their customers were asking for it. \n\n<Blockquote\n quote=\"The service mesh provides security and reliability in a uniform way across the platform. We are starting with MCP because the first thing that you want agents to do is to be able to access the existing resources. Let’s say you’re building an agentic workflow for automating a business process. You’ll benefit from the service mesh providing zero trust, so you exdecute the business process with confidence, We give you the same capabilities that LinkerD gives you for microservices. We know there’s more to do, but that’s the starting point.\"\n person=\"William Morgan\"\n title=\"CEO, Buoyant\"\n/>\n\nBuoyant also announced the availability of LinkerD for .NET applications on Windows.\n\n---\n\n## **Improving Configuration Management**\n\nFounding member of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) and GitOps creator Alexis Richardson returned to KubeCon to launch his new product, **ConfigHub**, which provides a “single source of truth” for Kubernetes as well as other infrastructure configuration data. \n\nConfigHub provides a new paradigm for provisioning, deploying, and operating cloud applications and infrastructure, including but not limited to Kubernetes.\n\n<Blockquote\n quote=\"ConfigHub keeps the configuration clean and up to date, and then maps it into the running state to catch any drift at the same time, There’s actually a missing notion of a collective sense of truth for the configuration, which is what’s relevant to operations. So that’s what we are bringing together.\"\n person=\"Alexis Richardson\"\n title=\"Founding Member of Technical Oversight Committe(TOC) and GitOps Creator\"\n/>\n\nSimilarly, Lee Calcote, CEO of Layer5, the company behind the CNCF Meshery project, announced their new product called Kanvas Designer, which provides an interactive, shared space for collaboration on configuration across an enterprise’s Kubernetes estate.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  quote=\"Think of it like a Google Workspace for engineers. Kanvas is providing a collaborative environment for working on configuration, Kanvas is an enterprise distribution of Mashery,” he added. “Meshery is basically an internal developer platform that gets various developer teams out of their silos and helps deliver DevOps as it was intended.\"\n  person=\"Lee Calcote\"\n  title=\"CEO of Layer5\"\n/>\n\n---\n\n## **Next Level Observability for Kubernetes**\n\nA lot of the current projects and vendor product focus appears to be on “next level” capabilities i.e. assuming Kubernetes is already widely used as the cloud deployment platform, and looking to solve next-level challenges.  \n\n<Blockquote\n quote=\"Let’s call it day two operations. People are saying, yes we have Kubernetes, and it’s working well. What do we need to do next?\"\n person=\"Chris Aniszczyk\"\n title=\"CTO, CNCF\"\n/>\n\n“Maybe we need an IDP (Internal Developer Platform), or we need to improve how we do observability. People always care about improving observability, which is especially crucial in the age of AI,” he said. “I basically call this platform engineering, as a way to improve how you build and run platforms in your company, so we have projects such as Backstage, Argo, and Crossplane for example,” he added. “We’ve learned from past KubeCons that if we just purely focused on Kubernetes, we wouldn’t have such a wide ecosystem.”\n\nIn this context Chronosphere, which builds observability solutions specifically for Kubernetes, announced their next-level observability product release with AI guided troubleshooting.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  quote=\"Our approach is to focus on where we can differentiate ourselves with respect to the developer experience, The first is this idea of guided troubleshooting where we study the behavior of the very best developers in the organization, who approach troubleshooting from the position of deep knowledge about the system. We figured out how to use AI to expose that same hypothesis-driven approach to troubleshooting for those who don’t have that deep knowledge.\"\n  person=\"Colleen White\"\n  title=\"Head of Product, Chronosphere\"\n/>\n\nAnd Dash0, a new company that is focusing on simplifying observability data collection and analysis entirely based on OpenTelemetry, announced its new version as well. \n\n<Blockquote\n quote=\"We launched last year and right from the beginning, it was really about being OpenTelemetry native. In other words, implementing the first tool around OpenTelemetry, the new standard for observability. Not just integrating it. A lot of the observability companies treat OpenTelemetry as just one input out of many. We just treat the data as OpenTelemetry all the time. There’s also something called the semantic convention of open Telemetry, which basically specifies a naming convention, and by doing so, we can now aggregate and create context and say, give me all the logs, metrics, and traces of that part because they all use the same tag name.\"\n person=\"MIrko Novakovic\"\n title=\"CEO, Dash0\"\n/>\n\n---\n\n## **The Intellyx Take**\n\nStandardizing Kubernetes through the open source project sponsored by CNCF significantly transformed cloud native computing. Ten years ago multiple container orchestration platforms were competing for a share of the market that Kubernetes and its variations now dominate for hosting microservices and other cloud native workloads. \n\nGenerative AI workloads have different requirements, though. They use GPUs instead of CPUs, and significantly more computing power is needed for training and inference. Agentic AI presents new challenges for security, observability, and network communication support. \n\nIt will be interesting to see whether the CNCF approach will succeed in standardizing generative AI workloads on a new type of hardware infrastructure, especially without NVIDIA on board.     \n\nMeanwhile, the success of Kubernetes continues to open significant opportunities to the vendor community for “next level” capabilities to simplify, observe, manage, configure, control, and secure Kubernetes workloads. \n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"KubeCon 2025: CNCF to Standardize AI Workloads","date":"November 23rd, 2025","author":"ITOps Times","category":"News Press","eurl":"https://itopstimes.com/kubernetes/kubecon-2025-cncf-to-standardize-ai-workloads/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ddb199cd40c9ed3c6299b26589f6471c/kubecon25.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmgAAABXRUJQVlA4IFwAAAAQBACdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJaQAD4nItBH//+naMZGZQAAD+9R45X5WF891dAB2D8yW87RxwM8QaUx3TUsiwdelWxfhSLuprTM0QxhgcAAjPv4AAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ddb199cd40c9ed3c6299b26589f6471c/5933c/kubecon25.webp","srcSet":"/static/ddb199cd40c9ed3c6299b26589f6471c/5933c/kubecon25.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.52}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ddb199cd40c9ed3c6299b26589f6471c/kubecon25.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmgAAABXRUJQVlA4IFwAAAAQBACdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJaQAD4nItBH//+naMZGZQAAD+9R45X5WF891dAB2D8yW87RxwM8QaUx3TUsiwdelWxfhSLuprTM0QxhgcAAjPv4AAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ddb199cd40c9ed3c6299b26589f6471c/5933c/kubecon25.webp","srcSet":"/static/ddb199cd40c9ed3c6299b26589f6471c/5933c/kubecon25.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.52}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/kubecon-2025-cncf-to-standardize-ai-workloads"}},{"id":"64618f15-325b-5341-8ef1-29dce268ac05","body":"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport kubeconImage from \"./kubecon-2025.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n[Atlanta, GA] [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America] – November 12, 2025 —\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) has announced the winners of its 2025 Community Awards, celebrating contributors, mentors, end users, and long-time ecosystem champions.

It also provides access to a catalog of hundreds of pre-built, best-practice design patterns and reference architectures that IT teams can extend.\n\nAdditionally, Kanvas also makes available role-based access controls (RBAC) and an ability to import existing Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize configuration and Docker Compose files.\n\nAvailable to be deployed by an internal IT team or access as a managed service, Kanvas today provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing and visualizing complex infrastructure and application architectures using Meshery.\n\nLayer5 is also making available in beta a Kanvas Operator for managing live infrastructure in real-time using a Meshery framework that is currently being advanced under the auspices of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).\n\nLayer5 CEO Lee Calcote said at its core Meshery provides a platform that fosters collaboration in a way that makes it simpler for IT teams to retain tribal knowledge. It allows engineers to see, collaborate on, and approve suggestions on a visual canvas, and even conduct a dry run to validate changes.\n\nIn addition to making it simpler to manage Kubernetes clusters at scale, Kanvas also makes it simpler to onboard additional engineers to a team, noted Calcote.\n\nIt’s not clear how many Kubernetes clusters are deployed in production environments, but as the number increases, the need for finding ways to manage one of the most complex IT platforms ever created is becoming more acute. There simply are not enough engineers to manage those clusters, so platforms such as Kanvas that make it simpler for small teams to consistently manage the configuration of Kubernetes clusters is crucial, said Calcote.\n\nHopefully, as various tools make Kubernetes more accessible, organizations will be able to rely more on IT administrators rather than DevOps engineers to manage them. The need for DevOps engineers isn’t likely to be eliminated any time soon, but it should become easier for IT teams to reuse configurations that have already been validated by a DevOps team. In effect, Meshery and Kanvas are making it simpler for IT teams to embrace infrastructure by design principles, noted Calcote.\n\nIn the meantime, IT organizations should expect the total number of workloads running on Kubernetes clusters to continue to steadily increase, especially as more artificial intelligence (AI) applications are built and deployed. The challenge, as always, is finding a way to manage large numbers of Kubernetes clusters at higher levels of scale. In fact, arguably there would many more Kubernetes clusters already deployed in the platform if the platform was easier to manage.\n\nHopefully, there will come a day soon when the inherent complexity of Kubernetes is no longer an issue, but until then, the next best thing is to adopt tools that enable IT teams to manage clusters at a much higher level of abstraction.\n\n**Read the original article on <Link to=\"https://cloudnativenow.com/features/layer5-debuts-enterprise-edition-of-meshery-for-configuring-kubernetes/\">https://cloudnativenow.com/features/layer5-debuts-enterprise-edition-of-meshery-for-configuring-kubernetes/</Link>**\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Layer5 Debuts Enterprise Edition of Meshery for Configuring Kubernetes","date":"November 12th, 2025","author":"Cloud Native Now","category":"Press Release","eurl":null,"thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpAAAABXRUJQVlA4IIQAAAAQBACdASoUAA8APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdACH/zTDx7+30AGW+uAD+7urTk+KRXFnjDrI1aIbUy6PuXva8zrQtiSqD05LwqqnAxGOUxtJZ16UbHbuaL4tSEe1H23sQUWNmPE2S0OQG0s9eVD2/cAGUC+zv4Fnp7g8ZJ9HpAFEAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/8e17d/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/2137d/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 750w,\n/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/e4a72/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 1080w,\n/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/10aea/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 1366w,\n/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/8e17d/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 1599w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.7629768605378362}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpAAAABXRUJQVlA4IIQAAAAQBACdASoUAA8APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdACH/zTDx7+30AGW+uAD+7urTk+KRXFnjDrI1aIbUy6PuXva8zrQtiSqD05LwqqnAxGOUxtJZ16UbHbuaL4tSEe1H23sQUWNmPE2S0OQG0s9eVD2/cAGUC+zv4Fnp7g8ZJ9HpAFEAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/8e17d/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/2137d/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 750w,\n/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/e4a72/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 1080w,\n/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/10aea/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 1366w,\n/static/5cbbf9b8e3453d72f5d9dfa6ebd97491/8e17d/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer-img.webp 1599w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.7629768605378362}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/layer5-debuts-enterprise-edition-of-meshery-for-configuring-kubernetes"}},{"id":"6003acda-ac2f-52ae-bd20-2e69f73e66c5","body":"\n\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\n\nimport KanvasDesignerImage from \"./Layer5-Kanvas-Designer.webp\";\nimport KanvasCatalogImage from \"./Kanvas-Catalog.webp\";\nimport KanvasSampleDesignImage from \"./Kanvas-Sample-Design-AWS-orchestration.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n**ATLANTA, GA** \\- November 11th, 2025 – [Layer5](https://layer5.io), the company behind the popular [Meshery](https://meshery.io) project, today announced the general availability (GA) of Kanvas. As an enterprise-grade distribution of Meshery, Kanvas is a critical platform engineering tool that unifies infrastructure design, operation, and collaboration for teams managing complex cloud native environments.\n\nKanvas directly addresses the persistent challenges that platform engineers, SREs, and architects face: the unmanageable cognitive load of highly distributed systems, critical security gaps arising from mismanaged secrets and insecure network configurations, and fragmented workflows that silo teams and slow innovation.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  quote=\"The rise of AI is about to amplify that complexity tenfold as it brings an onslaught of suggested infrastructure changes from non-deterministic LLMs, whose inherent risk of hallucination only exacerbates the cognitive overload of engineers.\"\n  person=\"Lee Calcote\"\n  title=\"CEO of Layer5\"\n/>\n\nKanvas functions as a \"Google Workspace for engineers,\" providing a unified, multi-modal collaboration suite built atop one of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s (CNCF) most dynamic open source projects, Meshery. Kanvas also tackles the high cost of turnover by facilitating the retention of tribal knowledge and significantly reducing the time to productivity for new engineers by streamlining the onboarding process for shipping code and managing infrastructure.\n\n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"Teams simply cannot be expected to approve a black box of LLM-generated changes. The way to safely harness the power of AI is to combat cognitive load ‘head-on’. This means visually representing *all* changes—whether from a human or an AI—in a way the mind can readily digest. A picture is worth a thousand words, as they say. In Kanvas, we call this 'infrastructure as design.'\"\n  person=\"Lee Calcote\"\n  title=\"CEO of Layer5\"\n/>\n\nKanvas allows engineers to see, collaborate on, and approve suggestions on a visual canvas, and even perform 'dry runs' of their designs through GitOps-infused visual diffs *before* a single change is committed to production. [Peer reviews in Kanvas restore human oversight](https://docs.layer5.io/videos/getting-started/comments/design-reviews-full/) and collaboration to an increasingly complex, AI-driven world.\n\n---\n\n## Kanvas has two powerful, integrated modes:\n\n* **Kanvas Designer** (GA): Offers an intuitive, declarative, drag-and-drop interface for designing and visualizing complex infrastructure and application architectures.  \n* **Kanvas Operator** (beta): Provides an imperative, hands-on mode for managing and operating live infrastructure in real-time.\n\nThis dual-mode approach allows platform engineers to curate a catalog of design patterns, solution architects to design multi-cloud infrastructure, and SREs to collaborate on incident resolution, all within a single platform.\n\n<p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n<a href={KanvasDesignerImage}><img src={KanvasDesignerImage} alt=\"Layer5 Kanvas Designer\" width=\"100%\" className=\"block-display align-center\" /></a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n## **Driven by Community, Ready for the Enterprise**\n\nThe power of Kanvas stems from its foundation in Meshery, which was recently recognized as the [sixth highest-velocity project out of more than 240 projects](https://meshery.io/blog/sixth-highest-velocity-cncf-project) in the CNCF. This incredible momentum, driven by over 3,000 global contributors, underscores the platform's stability, rich feature set, and the vibrant community driving its innovation.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  quote=\"Kanvas has me rethinking how I approach interactions with team members.

codenamed Mandala. \n\nThe Kubernetes 1.29 milestone is the final release for 2023 for the open source cloud native technology and introduces a range of new features and enhancements. Kubernetes has multiple updates this year, the new release follows the Kubernetes 1.28 update that came out in August.\n\nDubbed the “Mandala” release after the cosmic circular artwork, Kubernetes v1.29 reflects the project’s interconnected community of contributors. The release was shepherded by a 40-person release team and saw participation from 888 companies and 1,422 individuals over 14 weeks.\n\nAmong the major additions in this version are 11 features promoted to stable release status for general availability. This includes the new ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode that ensures only one pod can read/write a volume, node volume expansion secret support for container storage interface (CSI)  drivers and encryption at rest using KMS v2.\n\nNineteen features have entered beta, highlighting improvements to scheduling, node lifecycle management  and cleaning up legacy service account tokens. Some of the new alpha functionality includes better pod affinity rules, an nftables backend for kube-proxy networking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes Services.\n\n<h3>Networking improvements in Kubernetes 1.29</h3>\n\nKubernetes 1.29 multiple networking improvements. The new Kubernetes release will be the first to benefit from the new gateway API that helps to improve overall connectivity.\n\nSidecar containers also get a major boost. <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote/bio\">Lee Calcote</Link>, founder of <Link to =\"/company/about\">Layer5</Link> and a CNCF contributor told  SDxCentral that Kubernetes 1.28 introduced the concept of a sidecar container – a restartable init container. The concept of a sidecar has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. He noted that sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies in service meshes or for logging or running other auxiliary services to the main container.\n\n“Until 1.28, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support, and beginning now in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers, the kubelet (Kubernete node agent) will delay sending a termination signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated,” Calcote said. “Also new in 1.29 is the behavior of sidecar containers being terminated in reverse of the order in which they were initialized, so that they may continue to offer their services up to the very end of the Pod’s lifecycle.”\n\n</div>\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How Kubernetes 1.29 improves open source cloud native production readiness","date":"December 13th, 2023","author":"SDxCentral","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/how-kubernetes-1-29-improves-open-source-cloud-native-production-readiness/2023/12/","thumbnail":{"extension":"jpg","publicURL":"/static/93e14b4ec9a424898cd9cfea9fe4c089/kubernetes-1-29.jpg","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e14b4ec9a424898cd9cfea9fe4c089/52fc7/kubernetes-1-29.jpg","srcSet":"/static/93e14b4ec9a424898cd9cfea9fe4c089/52fc7/kubernetes-1-29.jpg 748w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/93e14b4ec9a424898cd9cfea9fe4c089/8abdf/kubernetes-1-29.webp 748w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5467914438502673}}},"darkthumbnail":null},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/how-kubernetes-129-improves-open-source-cloud-native-production-readiness"}},{"id":"b9c5d993-4319-578d-a366-3b13fd14ef13","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nThe open-source Kubernetes cloud-native platform is out with its second major update of 2023, introducing a long list of enhancements for operators in the new 1.28 release.\n\nKubernetes is an open-source project, originally started by Google and now developed under the Linux Foundation’s Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), benefiting from the contributions of more than 900 companies.

There are also a series of networking-related enhancements that will enable better security and performance.\n\nAs is the case with every Kubernetes release, there is a theme and a code name; for Kubernetes 1.28 the name is “Planternetes.” “So in the northern hemisphere, it’s summer right now and I think the symbolism of the garden and our community goes hand in hand,” Grace Nguyen, release lead for Kubernetes 1.28, told SDxCentral. “Each of us has a very important role in the ecosystem and together we built this big, open-source project that has a lot of impact.”\n\n<h3>Networking enhancements in Kubernetes 1.28</h3>\nLooking specifically at the networking capabilities of Kubernetes 1.28, there are a few enhancements that will also help to improve overall performance.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\n<Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote/bio\">Lee Calcote</Link>, founder of <Link to=\"/about\">Layer5</Link> and a CNCF contributor, explained that one of the key networking updates is an enhancement to the kube-proxy feature that will enable better connection-draining capabilities for load balancers targeting terminating nodes.\n\n“This enhancement improves the reliability of load balancer health checks and connection draining for terminating nodes within Kubernetes, so that kube-proxy can independently report its health regardless of the terminating state of the node,” Calcote told SDxCentral. “In this way, cloud providers in particular can be more sophisticated in ascertaining if a load balancer should target a specific node for ingress traffic or not.”\n\nAlso of note in Kubernetes 1.28 for networking is IPv4 to IPv6 dual-stack transition support for Kubernetes pods. Calcote explained that this enhancement allows pods to access information about both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the node they are running on, thereby enhancing their ability to adapt to dual-stack network transitions.\n\nCloud-native networking beyond Kubernetes\nWhile Kubernetes has many built-in capabilities, extensibility of the platform is a key attribute as well.\n\nCalcote explained that proxies running in Kubernetes are quite powerful and many support on-the-fly insertion or removal of traffic filters as plugins, with technologies like Envoy, Traefik, and NGINX as prime examples. He noted that each technology varies in support for the chaining of multiple filters and for the programming languages in which developers can create these filters. Envoy, in particular, supports WebAssembly (WASM)-based filters, which means that a number of different languages are supported.\n\n“Kubernetes has yet to address this deeper area of network traffic management, which is where CNCF projects like <a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a> step in with WASM filter management for any Envoy proxy or Envoy-based service-mesh data plane,” he said.\n\nKubernetes 1.28 has deep roots for stability\nNguyen noted that there are some 45 enhancements in the Kubernetes 1.28 update, spanning new stable, beta and alpha capabilities.\n\nKubernetes is widely deployed on public cloud providers and is also used as the foundation of several commercial offerings, including one from IBM‘s Red Hat business unit.\n\n“The latest release of Kubernetes has a number of enhancements to help increase the stability, performance and maintainability of the core platform while also augmenting workload innovation, including AI [artificial intelligence] and virtual machines,” Karena Angell, OpenShift Commons lead and senior principal product manager for Red Hat OpenShift and Hybrid Platforms, told SDxCentral.\n\nAngell said Red Hat is particularly interested in the new node system memory swap support that has been added to Kubernetes 1.28 to enable better memory performance across a cluster. Additionally, she noted that the Kubernetes Job API now allows for more choices in AI model training and retraining, which is especially key for AI-driven and intelligent workloads.\n\n“As Kubernetes continues to mature as a platform with release 1.28, we’re very happy to see a number of new features and tweaks that further support production stability and consistency,” Angell said. “Large and complicated jobs can now fail faster and more accurately which, while it sounds strange, contributes to better overall performance of Kubernetes in production.”\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":" Kubernetes 1.28 improves open-source cloud-native compute and networking","date":"August 16th, 2023","author":"SDxCentral","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://www.sdxcentral.com/articles/news/kubernetes-1-28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking/2023/08/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmwAAABXRUJQVlA4IGAAAABQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQAALSi9o9oMwgAD+9hLckS4P1YI6B11Z9XuB/c3BpyNYm2Duj5jvMmvIW6PPQjZ2TnmGQIfuaOt2ualH0vaAyFQA3HAAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/695f9/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/695f9/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.jpg 748w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/95cbe/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.webp 748w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmwAAABXRUJQVlA4IGAAAABQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQAALSi9o9oMwgAD+9hLckS4P1YI6B11Z9XuB/c3BpyNYm2Duj5jvMmvIW6PPQjZ2TnmGQIfuaOt2ualH0vaAyFQA3HAAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/695f9/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/695f9/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.jpg 748w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3eb21de35f0cfc76476ef06c71988d63/95cbe/kubernetes-1.28-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking.webp 748w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/kubernetes-128-improves-open-source-cloud-native-compute-and-networking"}},{"id":"3012342b-7816-55ca-8e10-9ec9dd473ec8","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nLayer5 is featured as one of the most innovative cloud management companies by Best Startup Texas.

The CNCF now hosts an array of helpful packages, spanning container scheduling, observability, persistent storage, container runtime and other areas.\n\nOdds are the cloud-native DevOps tool you need has already been developed—it’s only a matter of finding it. In recent posts, we highlighted many CNCF tools across various areas. Below, we’ll gloss over each category from a birds-eye view. Click each headline for the full rundown, or read below for a summary of the tools in each category.\n\n### Scheduling  Orchestration\n<br />\nKubernetes is the most popular container scheduling tool. It can be used to automate the deployment and management of multi-cloud applications. Other scheduling and orchestration utilities from CNCF include Crossplane, Fluid, Karmada, kube-rs, Open Cluster Management and Volcano.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Observability and Analysis\n<br />\nPrometheus tops the list of observability and analysis tools. The platform can be used to power your monitoring and alerting systems with fine-grained metrics and excellent querying capabilities. Other CNCF tools for observability and analysis include Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Cortex and OpenTelemetry.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Security and Compliance\n<br />\nOpen Policy Agent (OPA) can be used to unify cloud-native policies across the cloud-native stack. OPA uses a common language to express authorization policies and provides a policy engine to make authorization decisions. Other CNCF projects that deliver security-as-code include The Update Framework (TUF), Falco, Notary, cert-manager and Curiefense.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### CI/CD\n<br />\nArgo is a suite of packages that help direct jobs on Kubernetes to aid a continuous delivery pipeline. Using Argo, developers can create multi-step custom workflows and share these workflows across a cluster. Other CI/CD tools hosted by CNCF include Flux, Brigade, Keptn, OpenGitOps and OpenKruise.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Service Mesh Tools\n<br />\nLinkerd is a highly performant developer-favorite service mesh comprised of a control plane to apply configurations and a data plane that deploys its own unique proxy. This proxy can apply consistent security, observability, monitoring and telemetry features across distributed microservices. Other service mesh tools from CNCF include Kuma, Open Service Mesh (OSM), <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI) </Link> , <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance(SMP)</Link>.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Service Proxies\n<br />\nEnvoy is a service proxy commonly used within service meshes like Istio and Kuma. Envoy is intended to run alongside applications to help standardize networking and observability within large microservices networks. Other service proxy projects include Contour BFE and OpenELB.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Persistent Storage\n<br />\nRook is a tool that helps automate away some of the pains of managing cloud-native persistent storage. Rook supports file, block and object storage types and can be used for programmatic storage, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring and resource management. Other cloud-native persistent storage projects include Longhorn, CubeFS, K8up, OpenEBS, ORAS, Piraeus Datastore and Vineyard.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Cloud-Native Database Tools\n<br />\nTiKV is a unified distributed storage layer that can process large amounts of data. The project supports a key-value API and has rapid response times. Other cloud-native database utilities include Vitess, a clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL and SchemaHero, a Kubernetes operator for declarative database schema management.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Container Runtime\n<br />\nContainerd is an industry-standard container runtime supported by most container-based systems. Originally built as part of Docker, containerd was donated to the Linux Foundation in 2015. Other notable CNCF container runtime utilities include CRI-O, Inclavare Containers and WasmEdge Runtime.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### App Definition and Build Tools\n<br />\nHelm is a prevalent Kubernetes package manager widely used to share a manifest of dependencies. Operators often use Helm charts to find and install third-party applications. Other notable tools which help address operational concerns of Kubernetes include Buildpacks, KubeVirt, Operator Framework and Backstage.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Cloud-Native Networking\n<br />\nCilium is a tool that brings eBPF-based networking, security and observability. Cilium helps build out networking between container workloads and cross-cluster connectivity. Additional cloud-native networking utilities include Antrea, CNI-Genie, Kube-OVN, Network Service Mesh (NSM) and Submariner. There’s also the Container Network Interface (CNI), an interface specification for container networking.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Streaming and Messaging\n<br />\nCloudEvents offers a specification intended to help standardize the event-based communication from various event publisher systems. By having a way to describe events consistently, developers could solve interoperability issues. Other CNCF streaming and messaging projects include NATS, Pravega, Strimzi and Tremor.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Chaos Engineering\n<br />\nChaos Mesh is a chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes. Using Chaos Mesh, operators can push their Kubernetes deployments to the limit with stress testing, fault injections, and other testing behaviors. You can also schedule routine tests. Other cloud-native chaos testing tools from CNCF include Litmus and ChaosBlade.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Key Management\n<br />\nSPIFFE is defined as a universal identity control plane for a distributed architecture. Using SPIFFE, engineers can quickly construct a standard method to identify workloads and automatically secure service-to-service communication. SPIRE is the product-ready reference implementation of SPIFFE. Other key management tools from CNCF include Athenz and Teller.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Edge Computing and Bare Metal\n<br />\nKubeEdge helps extend cloud-native capabilities into edge computing. It’s specifically designed with the constraints of edge nodes in mind, such as reliability and resource limitations. Other projects that help extend Kubernetes to the edge include Akri, OpenYurt and SuperEdge. Other tools aid in provisioning K8s on bare metal, such as Metal3.io and Tinkerbell.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### The Forecast Looks Cloud-Native\n<br />\nBy 2023, the <Link to=\"https://containerjournal.com/features/majority-of-apps-will-use-cloud-native-development-by-2023/\">majority of applications will be cloud-native</Link>. The cloud-native world is here to stay, and open source is the foundation to support our new era of microservices, containerization and DevOps.\n\nAlthough you could technically self-host your way through development and operations using these open source projects, organizations will most likely adopt a blend of open source, proprietary and as-a-service cloud offerings to get the job done. Regardless, it’s cool to know what’s available for free use.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that tools change from time to time. As such, you can always view the up-to-date CNCF landscape here. Stay tuned as we keep an eye on CNCF and related bodies that continue to carry the cloud-native torch forward!\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Ultimate List of Open Source Cloud-Native Tools","date":"August 29th, 2022","author":"Bill Doerrfeld","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://containerjournal.com/features/the-ultimate-list-of-open-source-cloud-native-tools/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/tools.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAACQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUI7gBvJ/BT4AAP7vXdwpN2snlSYI33stdIWxDnyQXwnvJvKqE+8uWMAXFD71RO1AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/e30f5/tools.webp 750w,\n/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/tools.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAACQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUI7gBvJ/BT4AAP7vXdwpN2snlSYI33stdIWxDnyQXwnvJvKqE+8uWMAXFD71RO1AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/e30f5/tools.webp 750w,\n/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/the-ultimate-list-of-open-source-cloud-native-tools"}},{"id":"0e3c402b-8ec4-5d70-ae25-47f401a3c656","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"test\">\n\nThe open source Service Mesh Performance project is getting a new metric called MeshMark to help organizations manage and measure cloud-native environments.

MeshMark is part of the Service Mesh Performance project at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which hosted its ServiceMeshCon EU event on May 18, co-located alongside KubeCon EU 2022.\n\n\"We're missing some performance characteristics,\" Lee Calcote, founder and CEO of Layer5 and co-chair of the CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network, said during a ServiceMeshCon EU session. \"We have a need for a clear and concise way of conveying the characters and the performance of an environment.\"\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance project looks at capturing infrastructure and service mesh configuration details and then providing a means to characterize the details of running workloads. The project also aims to provide the details in a consistent approach that can enable organizations to develop a baseline for an environment, as well as benchmark in a consistent way. Simply being aware of what's running in a service mesh isn't quite enough though, and there is a need for a performance metric, which is where the new MeshMark effort comes into play. Mrittika Ganguli, principal engineer and network architect at Intel, explained that MeshMark is a cloud-native value measurement.\n\n\"With MeshMark, you're essentially trying to measure if the performance of your infrastructure matches what kind of business value you want to get from your deployment,\" Ganguli said.\n\nA business value could be defined with key performance indicators on, for example, how well video gets loaded on a particular webpage, she said.\n\n\"If you click on something, you may often see the text get rendered first and then the video,\" Ganguli said. \"The load latency of the video traffic is what impacts what you see visually.\"\n\nMeshMark aims to provide metrics that an organization can use to determine how resources are being used. Ganguli said that in a cloud-native environment an organization is utilizing different kinds of resources. The utilization classes include, for example, compute or network or any other type of resource.\n\nMeshMark provides an efficiency metric called Mesh Utilization Efficiency (MUE) that can help determine a score for a given resource utilization and the level of optimization. The MeshMark score will be able to help identify what the load latency is for a given workload, given the available resources. Overall, the goal with MeshMark is to take a number of different signals coming from a service mesh and combine them into an approach that can help organizations understand how well a deployment is, or isn't, working.\n\nThe need to better understand the performance of service meshes was further underscored by a report released on May 17 by the CNCF. The report found that 60% of surveyed organizations are using a service mesh in production today — and that key challenges for deployment of service meshes are a lack of guidance, blueprints, and best practices.\n\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Intel, Layer5 Announce MeshMark to Quantify Cloud-Native Performance","date":"May 21st, 2022","author":"ITPro Today","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://www.itprotoday.com/performance-management/intel-layer-5-announce-meshmark-quantify-cloud-native-performance","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/it-pro.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlAAAABXRUJQVlA4IEQAAADwAgCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAUU0usAD+9hPekOv5EN4vIa+8oARkiR/1LCYUhAC/k+W3o2CuRwAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp","srcSet":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9860d/it-pro.webp 750w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9ec3b/it-pro.webp 1080w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/20dcd/it-pro.webp 1366w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp 1540w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5194805194805194}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/it-pro.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlAAAABXRUJQVlA4IEQAAADwAgCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAUU0usAD+9hPekOv5EN4vIa+8oARkiR/1LCYUhAC/k+W3o2CuRwAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp","srcSet":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9860d/it-pro.webp 750w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9ec3b/it-pro.webp 1080w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/20dcd/it-pro.webp 1366w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp 1540w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5194805194805194}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/intel-layer5-announce-meshmark-to-quantify-cloud-native-performance"}},{"id":"118bead3-1b44-5f51-8312-589dbf9326ca","body":"import { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Formula from \"./MeshMark-Formula.webp\";\nimport MeshMapMeshmark from \"./meshmark-score.webp\";\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\nVALENCIA, Spain (May 17th, 2022) - ServiceMeshCon EU /KubeCon EU - <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/meshmark\">MeshMark</a> is a performance index that measures the <i>value</i> and <i>overhead</i> of your cloud native environment.

As such, it now makes more sense to enable contributors working on both Istio and Kubernetes to work more closely with one another, he adds.\n\nThe decision to apply to become an incubation project comes on the heels of the donation of Knative, an open source middleware for connecting Kubernetes clusters to serverless computing frameworks—also originally created by Google—to the CNCF. Assuming the CNCF accepts the Istio contribution, the three major cloud-native initiatives led by Google would all be governed under the auspices of a CNCF consortium that requires organizations to give up control over the trademarks attached to any open source project.\n\nRyan says IT organizations should expect to see ongoing innovation in the months ahead as competition between various service mesh platforms intensifies. At the same time, there may be opportunities to share advances across multiple service meshes being governed by the CNCF. Those service meshes currently include Linkerd, originally developed by Buoyant, and Kuma, originally developed by Kong, Inc. The CNCF is also home to a Meshery framework for managing service meshes created by Layer5 and a Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project originally created by Microsoft.\n\nService meshes initially emerged as a way to manage APIs at scale instead of relying on proxy software or an API gateway alone. More recently, IT organizations have started to appreciate the programmable layer of abstraction that a service mesh creates above lower-level networking and security interfaces. That layer of abstraction makes those underlying services more accessible to developers.\n\nCompetition between service mesh platforms revolves around two core issues. Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio’s advocates argue that it’s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines.\n\nRegardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow.\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Petitions to Donate Istio Service Mesh to CNCF","date":"April 25th, 2022","author":"Container Journal","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://containerjournal.com/features/google-petitions-to-donate-istio-service-mesh-to-cncf/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/istio-to-cncf.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoYAAABXRUJQVlA4IHoAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADJ0cjRCDWSAAA/XewSBvyoQYiD1cQHeEFbM7LAg9ddJNbknH9S1TXD3EHxkiIyUhEAJbtt0H21+0x9pCzwwsne34jJMNGmYskXUV0T84CNVNij8wdtgX+LgAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp","srcSet":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/e30f5/istio-to-cncf.webp 750w,\n/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/istio-to-cncf.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoYAAABXRUJQVlA4IHoAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADJ0cjRCDWSAAA/XewSBvyoQYiD1cQHeEFbM7LAg9ddJNbknH9S1TXD3EHxkiIyUhEAJbtt0H21+0x9pCzwwsne34jJMNGmYskXUV0T84CNVNij8wdtgX+LgAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp","srcSet":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/e30f5/istio-to-cncf.webp 750w,\n/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/google-petitions-to-donate-istio-service-mesh-to-cncf"}},{"id":"fd3769c2-31fa-5819-9e16-03235ec50013","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div>\n\nIf you work with container technology and cloud platforms, it is nearly impossible to not have heard of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). \nThe CNCF organization promotes innovations in accessible container technology by supporting open-source, vendor-neutral projects in the cloud-native ecosystem.\nIts first, and perhaps most famous, project was the container orchestration platform Kubernetes, which has continued to lead and shape the industry.\nSince then, CNCF has continued to develop open-source tools, standards, and resources that have formed the core of the cloud strategy of hundreds of organizations around the globe.\n\nThe CNCF’s technical oversight committee (TOC) meets regularly to vote to decide which projects are accepted into the foundation.\nProjects are ranked according to three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated — listed in increasing order of maturity.\nThe criteria for each maturity level depends on adoption by end users, quality of end products, and adherence to standards for security, governance, committers, and infrastructure.\nSandbox projects are usually projects in the early stages of development that show promise.\nI’ve gathered some of the rising Sandbox projects added by the CNCF in 2021 for you, so that you can take a look at the tools that are driving the future of cloud native technology.\n\n<h3>8.

However, it’s challenging to manage a sea of disparate microservices. It’s specifically difficult to consistently apply standard features such as traffic management, security and observability mechanisms across all microservices. This issue grows as the number of microservices climbs into the hundreds and thousands.\n\nThis is where service mesh comes in. Service mesh helps to apply common observability and security features across applications. It’s typically split into a control plane, used to configure features, and a data plane, consisting of a sidecar proxy alongside each application. Nowadays, several service mesh options exist in the market, each with varying levels of complexity.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is home to much of today’s innovative cloud-native technology. The foundation now hosts a few service meshes and related projects.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.\n\n“We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure”, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. “Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of  service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.”\n\n<h3>Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement</h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance</a> is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.\n<ol>\n    <li>the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.</li>\n    <li>standard benchmarks of service mesh performance</li>\n    <li>common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh</li>\n    <li>apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.</li>\n    <li>a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\"A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.”, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. “SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.\"\n\n<img src={smpMeshery} alt=\"SMP in Meshery\"/>\n\n<h3>CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project</h3>\n\nWith multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.\n\n“As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking”, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. “Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments”. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. “An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change“, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.\n\n\n<h3>Partnership with University of Texas at Austin, Intel, HashiCorp, and Red Hat engineers</h3>\n\n“More than performance, in collaboration with our maintainers from Layer5, Intel, Red Hat, and HashiCorp, we are actively standardizing service mesh value measurement in the form of a new index to be announced early next year”, said Calcote. “As a foundation for this research, 5,000 service mesh performance tests donated by users of Meshery have been donated and are under analysis.” \n\nPerformance tests are run by Meshery, the open source, multi-mesh manager. Meshery is the canonical implementation of Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and the conformance tool of Service Mesh Interface (SMI). Meshery implements and helps users adopt and vendors uphold these specifications. A jointly authored paper on service mesh performance methodologies will be published by the IEEE later this month, which explores how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much operators value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, and latency.\n\n<h3>Service Mesh Performance Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/subscribe\">Community Newsletter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Discussion Forum</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrncjtPpg4&list=PL3A-A6hPO2INwi8A3NNClvdCxDoHa9NOU\">Service Mesh Performance YouTube</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>About Layer5</h3>\nLayer5 offers cloud native application management by harnessing the unique position service meshes have in changing how developers write applications, how operators run modern infrastructure and how product owners manage their service offerings.

{ NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\nBoth the Meshery and Service Mesh Performance (SMP) projects joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) earlier this month at the Sandbox level.\n\nMeshery is a multiservice mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads, while SMP is a standard for capturing and characterizing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.\n\nWhen the projects first applied in April for inclusion, the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) had one clarifying question for them: should they be combined with or aligned in some manner with the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project?\n\nLee Calcote, founder of Layer5, the company partly behind both of the projects, explained that it was an alluring prospect for the CNCF, but that, for the time being at least, the projects would continue on their own separate paths.\n\nCalcote, who also serves as the chair of the Network special interest group (SIG) at the CNCF, said he then presented to the CNCF the following diagram, which shows the relation between the three projects. For the time being, he said, both SMI and SMP are “relatively younger projects, both of which still are figuring out what they want to be when they grow up,” and may be considered for consolidation later on down the line, while Meshery has a larger focus than the two projects and will definitely be kept on its own.\n\nWhile the SMI works to define the broadest characteristics that could apply to something defined as a service mesh, looking for the lowest common denominator, Meshery works in the opposite direction, trying to accentuate the differences and strengths of the individual services meshes. SMP, meanwhile, is more of a specification and works to provide a common format for capturing and describing data around the performance of the service mesh itself.\n\nIn comparison to SMI, Calcote said that “SMP essentially just goes a lot deeper. Part of what is trying to address is this long-standing question — and it’s a question that faces the people who are adopting a service mesh today, people who are adopting service mesh tomorrow, people who have already adopted a service mesh — What should I be measuring to consider how efficiently I’m running my service mesh?”\n\nBetween the three projects, then, users have not just a way to interface with any SMI-compatible service mesh via a common API, but also a way to measure the performance of different service meshes, and finally, a method with which to interface with and operate those service meshes while taking advantage of their specific advantages.\n\n“Part of the belief is that service meshes are an inevitable new layer in your cloud native infrastructure that over time will be a ubiquitous component,” said Calcote. “There’s a lot that can be done in the network, a lot of intelligence, and so Meshery, as a management plane, picks off some of those features.”\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CNCF Projects Bring Service Mesh Interoperability, Benchmarks","date":"July 24th, 2021","author":"The New Stack","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://thenewstack.io/cncf-projects-bring-service-mesh-interoperability-benchmarks/","thumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/The-New-Stack-Logo.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAqUlEQVR42mNgWPe5lWHt50aG9V8msqz9tIhh998Jl9xmVvw3aJ3/16B9xRez7lKz6Q+mzcxZf2xDxIrJDBu+1DCu/dwAUg9kT2VY96WeYd2nVIYNn9czbPwWyQA0MIxhw/dEhvVf25jXfJrHsPV392X3mbH/DVrm/Tdq2/DBojujpmb39Jk5Gy7tjFjkxLDjTznzmo8zgOqbgXgm0LAlQMOTgXgVw9pP6QDWcFfhh0v1AgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/bc8df/The-New-Stack-Logo.png","srcSet":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/bc8df/The-New-Stack-Logo.png 367w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/e45b8/The-New-Stack-Logo.webp 367w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.11989100817438691}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/The-New-Stack-Logo.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAqUlEQVR42mNgWPe5lWHt50aG9V8msqz9tIhh998Jl9xmVvw3aJ3/16B9xRez7lKz6Q+mzcxZf2xDxIrJDBu+1DCu/dwAUg9kT2VY96WeYd2nVIYNn9czbPwWyQA0MIxhw/dEhvVf25jXfJrHsPV392X3mbH/DVrm/Tdq2/DBojujpmb39Jk5Gy7tjFjkxLDjTznzmo8zgOqbgXgm0LAlQMOTgXgVw9pP6QDWcFfhh0v1AgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/bc8df/The-New-Stack-Logo.png","srcSet":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/bc8df/The-New-Stack-Logo.png 367w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/666bce02056775aeb9a1de0f96dc0f9f/e45b8/The-New-Stack-Logo.webp 367w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.11989100817438691}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/cncf-projects-bring-service-mesh-interoperability-benchmarks"}},{"id":"d5db9e8a-0505-5a0f-8718-60931d1ea9f9","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div>\nDevOps teams use the right tools to automate deployment plans to minimize risk to the product and customer experience. These service mesh tools also provide synchronization with web communication standards, adapted to varying security protocols, and offer better management.\n\n## Here are some lesser-known Kubernetes service mesh tools:\n\n**Autopilot:** Autopilot is a toolkit and SDK used for deploying and developing service mesh operators. It is developed by Solo.io, a service connectivity company. This service was launched in late-2019. The service allows its users to automate the service mesh interface for chaos experimentation, adaptive security, canary automation, and more.\n\n**Consul:** Consul, a service mesh solution, has a full-featured control plane. It was first released in 2014 and developed by HashiCorp. This service mesh can be installed and configured on an existing Kubernetes cluster. Its latest version is 1.9.5 that was released on April 15, 2021\n\n**OSM:** Open Service Mesh (OSM) is an open-source service mesh created by Microsoft that supports the Kubernetes environment. It is a cloud-native service mesh that allows users to manage and secure service meshes consistently. It also offers out-of-the-box observability features for dynamic microservice environments.\n\n**Layer5:** Layer5 is a service mesh company and a worldwide community that offers a large collection of service mesh projects. The community creates and maintains several projects that focus on the service mesh-centric capabilities in a cloud-based environment.\nThe key projects operating under the Layer5 community include: `Meshery`, `Learn Layer5`, `Service Mesh Landscape`, `Image Hub`, `Meshery Operator`, `Service Mesh Interface Conformance`, and `NightHawk`.\n\n**Kuma:** Kuma is an open-source service mesh that provides support for multiple environments across clouds, such as Kubernetes and virtual machines. It was created by Kong, and it was recently added to CNCF as a Sandbox project. Moreover, Kuma is production-ready, and it is still under active development.\n\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Lesser-Known, But Extremely Powerful Kubernetes Service Mesh Tools","date":"June 18th, 2021","author":"TechGenix","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://techgenix.com/kubernetes-service-mesh-tools/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpgAAABXRUJQVlA4IIwAAABQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdAB9pIQtJHMb0adr3YHYAAP7tJ1NrnPpDtvGpt7brKer8G134gCRlvCJ7Hiq5yiKFcbg2BqHU0Clqc10JmY4yTR+84sxdcD1YOdAgx4a3nDtOLfW2qE7XFh1g8iqu+AQbOhJYa/oa2/r8yr14MRMAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/a66aa/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 750w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/65dd5/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1080w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/4fad6/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1366w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpgAAABXRUJQVlA4IIwAAABQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdAB9pIQtJHMb0adr3YHYAAP7tJ1NrnPpDtvGpt7brKer8G134gCRlvCJ7Hiq5yiKFcbg2BqHU0Clqc10JmY4yTR+84sxdcD1YOdAgx4a3nDtOLfW2qE7XFh1g8iqu+AQbOhJYa/oa2/r8yr14MRMAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/a66aa/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 750w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/65dd5/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1080w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/4fad6/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1366w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/5-lesser-known-but-extremely-powerful-kubernetes-service-mesh-tools"}},{"id":"459562ad-b96a-5c5e-b19c-6870f3a21187","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div>\n\n\"Cloud native\" doesn't just mean \"running in the cloud.\" It's a specific deployment paradigm and uses containers and an orchestration system (usually Kubernetes) to help provision, schedule, run and control a production workload in the cloud, or even across multiple clouds. Within cloud native deployments, an increasingly common approach to networking is the service mesh concept. With a service mesh, instead of each individual container requiring a full networking stack, a grouping of containers all benefit from a mesh that provides connectivity and networking with other containers as well as the outside world.\n\nService mesh in the wild\nWhile the concept of a service mesh has applicability beyond just Kubernetes deployments, that's arguably where the vast majority of deployments are today. Among the earliest cloud-native service mesh approaches is the open source Linkerd project, which is backed by Buoyant and began to really ramp up adoption in 2017.\n\nOver the past three years there has been an explosion of open source service mesh technology. Layer5, which develops service mesh aggregation technology, currently tracks over 20 different open and closed source mesh projects. Beyond Linkerd, among the most popular is the Google-backed Istio project, which recently hit its 1.8 milestone release. Cisco has backed the Network Service Mesh (NSM) effort, which works at a lower level in the networking stack than Linkerd, Istio and most others.\n\nEach mesh has its own take on configuration and capabilities, which is a good thing for users. Simply put, there is no shortage of options and there is likely to be a service mesh that already exists to meet just about any need.\n\nService mesh abstraction\nWhile having lots of different service mesh technologies is good for choice, it's not necessarily a good thing for simplicity or interoperability. That's where the concept of service mesh abstraction comes into play.\n\nAt the recent KubeCon NA 2020 virtual event, Lee Calcote, co-chair of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) and founder of Layer5, outlined how the different service mesh abstraction technologies fit together.\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a way for any compliant service mesh to plug into Kubernetes. The Service Mesh Performance (SMP) abstraction is all about providing visibility into service mesh performance though a common interface. The third key abstraction is known as Hamlet and it provides multi-vendor service interoperation and mesh federation capabilities.\n\nService mesh benefits\nThere are a number of different benefits that service meshes can bring, which are helping to accelerate adoption. Calcote explained that with a service mesh there is a decoupling of developer and operations teams such that each can iterate independently.\n\nAs such, operators can make changes to infrastructure independent of developers. DevOps is supposed to mean developer and operations teams work together, but the reality is often quite different and the ability to build application and infrastructure separately is why service mesh has been such a winning proposition for so many organizations.\n\n\"We live within a software defined network landscape, and service meshes in some respects are sort of a next-gen SDN,\" Calcote said.\n\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Offers Promising Solution for Cloud Native Networking","date":"December 4th, 2020","author":"Enterprise Networking Planet","category":"Coverage","eurl":"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/datacenter-blog/service-mesh-cloud-native-networking.html","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/service-mesh.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpIAAABXRUJQVlA4IIYAAAAwBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZQC7IDZgmudmGpiGoFX6QKQA/vJjCvgvJkbUF3Y/liMf2Cr8/xo37hrE91bGryC9YOKTJG8D8g1+ChfX6+G1GWpa9O7A7elEBZNUcKzVonLWpxYHA/+hwJ2RWKO+4cLpZL/I4FlFrcEH454AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp","srcSet":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp 600w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5266666666666667}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/service-mesh.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpIAAABXRUJQVlA4IIYAAAAwBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZQC7IDZgmudmGpiGoFX6QKQA/vJjCvgvJkbUF3Y/liMf2Cr8/xo37hrE91bGryC9YOKTJG8D8g1+ChfX6+G1GWpa9O7A7elEBZNUcKzVonLWpxYHA/+hwJ2RWKO+4cLpZL/I4FlFrcEH454AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp","srcSet":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp 600w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5266666666666667}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/service-mesh-offers-promising-solution-for-cloud-native-networking"}},{"id":"fd6ca157-b8fb-5194-9d9f-4ebdc2afca86","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport serviceMeshAbstractions from \"./service-mesh-abstractions.webp\";\nimport serviceMeshPerformance from \"./service-mesh-performance.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nAs more organizations implement service meshes, they are finding what works and what needs more work, and they are creating new management practices around this knowledge. A few tried-and-tested best practices were detailed last month during KubeCon+CloudNativeCon.\n\n“There’s a lot to say about each of these service meshes and how they work: their architecture, why they’re made, what they’re focused on, what they do when they came about and why some of them aren’t here anymore and why we’re still seeing new ones,” Lee Calcote, founder of Layer5, explained during his talk entitled “Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter in Your Deployment.”\n\nService mesh is increasingly seen as a requirement to manage microservices in Kubernetes environments, offering a central control plane to manage microservices access, testing, metrics and other functionalities. One-third of the respondents in The New Stack survey of our readers said their organizations already use service mesh. Among the numerous service mesh options available; Envoy, Istio, Linkerd and Kuma are but a few on offer.\n\n### Interoperability Is Key as Service Meshes Come and Go\n\nOrganizations will likely look to use at least more than one API service layer and service mesh for their clusters. This is why interoperability, and thus specifications, are critical for control planes as well. During his talk — “Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter in Your Deployment” mentioned above — for example, Calcote, asked rhetorically:\n\n“How many specifications, how many standards are there that have come to the rescue, so to speak, for understanding and interoperating with the various service meshes that are out there?” Calcote said.\n\n<a href={serviceMeshAbstractions}><img src={serviceMeshAbstractions} alt=\"service-mesh-abstractions\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nA service mesh can be used for testing router performance, service latency and other variables. However, determining service mesh performance in an apples-to-apples way can be challenging. When studying “published results from some of the service meshes [from providers] that do publish results about performance… what you’ll find is that they’re probably using an environment that isn’t necessarily like yours,” Calcote said. “They’re also using different statistics and metrics to measure [their service meshes] … and it doesn’t help.”\n\n<a href={serviceMeshPerformance}><img src={serviceMeshPerformance} alt=\"service-mesh-performance\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nService mesh performance (SMP) was created in an attempt to establish a way of comparing the performance of different services. “The SMP was born in combination with engaging with a few of those different service mesh maintainers and creating a standard way of articulating a performance of a mesh,” Calcote said.\n\nAmong the variables in consideration, in addition to the service mesh itself, include the number of clusters, workloads, the types of nodes, control plan configuration and the use of client libraries all affect performance.\n\n“What costs more, what’s more efficient and what’s more powerful: These are all open questions that SMP assists in answering in your environment,” Calcote said.\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"KubeCon+CloudNativeCon","date":"December 2nd, 2020","author":"The New Stack","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://thenewstack.io/kubeconcloudnativecon-service-mesh-battle-stories-and-fixes/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/service-mesh-implementations.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAgAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADf76Io9ukEMKaAAD+0NVX8yrCCYso0t4m+uqXvUNcjspWp5cPsm9igQenys+i4un1qy0qCumd6/zcds2HFNCb9SqZQTZuLg8wT+AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp","srcSet":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/b07c1/service-mesh-implementations.webp 750w,\n/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.41503906250000006}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/service-mesh-implementations.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAgAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADf76Io9ukEMKaAAD+0NVX8yrCCYso0t4m+uqXvUNcjspWp5cPsm9igQenys+i4un1qy0qCumd6/zcds2HFNCb9SqZQTZuLg8wT+AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp","srcSet":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/b07c1/service-mesh-implementations.webp 750w,\n/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.41503906250000006}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/kubeconcloudnativecon"}},{"id":"83a4f01b-acfc-5f1d-9d6c-af88173ebdd9","body":"\nimport kubernetes from \"./kubernetes-platform.webp\";\n\n<img align=\"left\" style={{ padding: \"15px\" }} src={kubernetes} alt=\"Kubernetes-platform\" />\n\nA service mesh has become a critical part of platforms based on Kubernetes clusters. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic managementxi, security, observability, and shaping for services implemented by the cluster and supporting components. As clusters have grown in size and platforms have become comprised of many clusters, maintaining a consistent view, management, and policies for network layer 4 – 7 traffic has become increasingly complex.\n\nIn response, a number of vendors have extended control planes with a multi-cluster management layer such that they federate and manage service meshes at scale across multiple clouds and on-premises deployments. Both Hashicorp Consul and VMWare Tanzu NSX Service Mesh extend the service mesh control plane past the local service mesh to allow a management layer over multiple clouds and clusters. The open source project <a href=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\"><b>Meshery</b></a> is also providing a service mesh management plane as separate software that can interact using the Service Mesh Interface or through built-for-purpose adapters for a variety of existing service mesh products and projects.\n\nLike Kubernetes control planes, this extension of the service mesh control plane allows for consistent management and policies across clusters in different environments, a situation that is becoming more typical in enterprise IT applications.\n\nService mesh control plane federation is an emerging feature of service mesh products. Unlike Kubernetes control planes, it is not yet commonplace, but Amalgam Insights predicts that we will see service mesh control plane federation become a normal part of the service mesh landscape.\n\n<center>\n<h5 className=\"black-text\">Access the full <a href=\"https://amalgaminsights.com/2018/12/20/the-view-from-kubeconcloudnativecon-seattle/\">research from Amalgam Insights</a></h5>\n</center>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meshery Provides the Service Mesh Management Plane and Kubernetes Evolves into an Enterprise Platform","date":"October 29th, 2020","author":"Amalgam Insights","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://amalgaminsights.com/2018/12/20/the-view-from-kubeconcloudnativecon-seattle/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/d5ca72e88de08ce71380ce562f67719c/kubernetes-platform.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRk4AAABXRUJQVlA4IEIAAABwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJaQAAUz7ZZ8qBWQAA/vGd5EmHfVUQRyXKfh9ED+fAbmSNCQRFF7yTAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d5ca72e88de08ce71380ce562f67719c/b669d/kubernetes-platform.webp","srcSet":"/static/d5ca72e88de08ce71380ce562f67719c/b669d/kubernetes-platform.webp 404w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.504950495049505}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/d5ca72e88de08ce71380ce562f67719c/kubernetes-platform.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRk4AAABXRUJQVlA4IEIAAABwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJaQAAUz7ZZ8qBWQAA/vGd5EmHfVUQRyXKfh9ED+fAbmSNCQRFF7yTAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d5ca72e88de08ce71380ce562f67719c/b669d/kubernetes-platform.webp","srcSet":"/static/d5ca72e88de08ce71380ce562f67719c/b669d/kubernetes-platform.webp 404w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.504950495049505}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/meshery-provides-the-service-mesh-management-plane-and-kubernetes-evolves-into-an-enterprise-platform"}},{"id":"bbc29500-fde1-5510-8899-cab604e7f720","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nMeshery took its first steps into the Cloud Native world in July of 2019 with the vision to ease the adoption and operation of any service mesh.

Layer5’s [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), the cloud native management plane, and HashiCorp’s [Consul](https://consul.io) integrate to provide advanced, cloud native infrastructure solutions for containerized and non-containerized workloads - strengths of Consul. The marriage of these technologies forms a layering of network planes: data, control, and management.\n\n<a href={layer5_hashicorp_partnership}>\n  <img\n    src={layer5_hashicorp_partnership}\n    alt=\"layer5-hashicorp-partnership\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n  />\n</a>\n\n_Service Mesh Planes: Consul and Meshery. Learn more about service mesh planes in [The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures](https://layer5.io/books/the-enterprise-path-to-service-mesh-architectures)._\n\nConsul’s broad and prevalent use across [any runtime or infrastructure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/datacenter-deploy/reference-architecture) (bare metal servers, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and any cloud) is a key facilitator of the modernization of IT infrastructure - a significant attractant for Layer5 to focus on this integration; to meet customers where they’re at. The lynchpin of the integration of Consul and Meshery is the Meshery Adapter for Consul. Through this adapter, Meshery facilitates lifecycle management of Consul service mesh deployments, evaluates and espouses configuration best practices published by HashiCorp. Meshery provides users with an interface to apply custom configuration to their Consul service mesh in an ad hoc fashion.\n\n### Lifecycle management of sample applications\n\nThe [Meshery Adapter for Consul](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul) comes bundled with a handful of sample applications for evaluating, exploring, and learning how to operate Consul service mesh. Many operators are new to the ongoing administrative tasks of running a healthy and optimized Consul service mesh deployment. In advance of their production deployments, operators may utilize Meshery to quickly deploy Consul with sample applications to gain familiarity with the many features of Consul.\n\nDemonstrated at DockerCon 2020, is the “[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub)”, a sample application built to allow users to explore Consul’s feature set, and specifically, an experimental area of Consul’s data plane: Envoy’s impending support for WebAssembly.\n\n### Performance management of Consul and it’s workloads\n\nIn order to assess the overall performance of the service mesh, and the overhead of individual, fine-grained traffic control mechanisms defined in Consul’s control plane and enforced through Consul’s intelligent data plane, Meshery provides users with statistical analysis of the responsiveness of their services and performance of the service mesh. As highlighted by Docker Captain, [Luc Juggery](https://twitter.com/lucjuggery), performance is an ongoing concern:\n\n<div style={{ margin: \"20px\" }}>\n  Running a performance test is not a one shot thing. Tests should be run on a\n  regular basis to (re)establish baselines and evaluate configuration changes:\n  <ul>\n    <li>- for each new release of the chosen service mesh</li>\n    <li>- for each change of the configuration of your service mesh</li>\n    <li>- for each new release of the application\"</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\nMeshery’s ability to connect to Prometheus instances to retrieve and account for cluster and application-level metrics is popularly used during Meshery’s service mesh performance tests. Likewise, Meshery’s ability to connect to and import existing dashboards, panels, and charts from Grafana is instrumental in allowing users to retain their existing investment in dashboards and metrics they have curated over time.\n\n## Meshery Announces Experimental Support for WebAssembly using Consul\n\nToday, at [DockerCon 2020](https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/content/Videos/63TCCNpzDC7Xxnm8b), we demonstrate technology leadership in advanced data plane engineering for near-native performance of fine-grained traffic control facilitated by Meshery and Consul with the use of Envoy and WebAssembly.\n\n<a href={layer5_image_hub}>\n  <img src={layer5_image_hub} alt=\"layer5-hashicorp-imagehub\" width=\"100%\" />\n</a>\n\n_In this demonstration, Meshery takes advantage of Consul’s use of Envoy. Envoy support for WebAssembly is impending._\n\n### WebAssembly’s near-native performance\n\nWebAssembly, or WASM, is an open standard that defines a binary format for executable programs. Through WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), it also defines interfaces for facilitating interaction with host environments. The initial focus of these host environments was browsers and large web applications with the intention of securely running programs to improve performance. As an open standard, WASM is maintained by the W3C, and has been adopted by all modern browsers. After HTML, CSS, and Javascript, WebAssembly is the fourth language to natively run in web browsers.\n\nWebAssembly is exciting because of its performance characteristics, running between 10% to 20% overhead as compared to natively executed code for network filtering use cases. WebAssembly bears some resemblance to Docker given its high degree of portability. Like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), WASM’s virtual stack machine is becoming a write once, run anywhere (WORA). WASM executables are precompiled with a healthy variety of languages supporting it as a compilation target - currently about 40 languages.\n\nWASM support is coming to Envoy through the efforts of Google, and Envoy maintainers embedding Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, V8, into Envoy. Through the WebAssembly System Interface, Envoy exposes an Application Binary Interface (ABI) to WASM modules, so that they can operate as Envoy filters. The way WASI works is straight-forward. You write your application in your favourite languages like Rust, C or C++. Then, build and compile them into a WebAssembly binary targeting the host environment. The generated binary requires the WebAssembly runtime to provide the necessary interfaces to system calls for the binary to execute. Conceptually, this is similar to JVM. If you have a JVM installed then you can run any Java-like languages on it. Similarly, with a runtime, you can run the WebAssembly binary.\n\n## Learn more\n\nThis integration of management, control, and data planes is a powerful combination.

{ NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\"\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nWhen an organization is forced to manage distributed service-to-service communication over a large network, service mesh provides a dedicated layer where separate parts of an application can communicate with each other. This way, software teams can centralize communication, rather than monitor each individual service message exchange independently.\n\nWhen service mesh emerged in 2018, many saw this technology as a way to tackle the complexity of container deployment at production scale. They also saw it as a way to address unsustainable manual traffic management processes.\n\nIn 2019, the success of service mesh implementation inspired a rush of vendors that hoped to cash in on the need to manage services at scale. The industry saw a booming sub-ecosystem around two major service mesh options, Google's Istio and the open source Envoy, plus many à la carte tools, such as Tetrate and Meshery. A handful of newcomers jumped into the fray, such as HashiCorp, Kong, Containous, Aspen Mesh and Layer5. Despite the competition, Istio and Envoy led the pack.\n\nThe service mesh market saw two significant events in 2019. First, Envoy Project Authors fine-tuned its increasingly popular sidecar proxy design pattern. Second, Google kept its service mesh technology, and Istio, out of the open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and thereby retained proprietary control.\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Vendors make a splash in 2019 service mesh implementation rush","date":"December 27th, 2019","author":"TechTarget","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/feature/Vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnQAAABXRUJQVlA4IGgAAABQBACdASoUAAYAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZQCdH8G6A5/8B5Pd7JAOdIsAAP7Hfg7V6Cw+lBvPBuF5PLewMAEGH3x14wTH6pKuiqCh/pETb+DWCdaMnSQXMD8R1kSMqbBP+Ao0ZoAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp","srcSet":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/440b4/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 750w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/4dabe/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1080w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1274w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3021978021978022}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnQAAABXRUJQVlA4IGgAAABQBACdASoUAAYAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZQCdH8G6A5/8B5Pd7JAOdIsAAP7Hfg7V6Cw+lBvPBuF5PLewMAEGH3x14wTH6pKuiqCh/pETb+DWCdaMnSQXMD8R1kSMqbBP+Ao0ZoAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp","srcSet":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/440b4/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 750w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/4dabe/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1080w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1274w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3021978021978022}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush"}},{"id":"d54999fc-e89f-5c6b-935a-5af585bf53eb","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nIn 2019, we saw service mesh move beyond an experimental technology and into a solution that organizations are beginning to learn is an elemental building block for any successful Kubernetes deployment. Adoption of service mesh at scale, across companies large and small, began to gain steam. As the second wave of adopters watched the cutting edge adopters trial and succeed with service mesh technology, they too began to evaluate service mesh to address the challenges Kubernetes leaves on the table.\n<br/>\n\nIn tandem with growing adoption of service mesh, 2019 offered a burgeoning service mesh market. Istio and Linkerd keep chugging along, and the tooling and vendor ecosystem around Istio almost tripled throughout the year. But there were also many new players that entered the market providing alternative approaches to solving layer seven networking challenges. Meshes, such as those Kuma and Maesh offer, have emerged to provide different approaches to service mesh in order to address various edge use cases. We also saw the introduction of tools like [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/) spec and [Meshery](https://layer5.io/meshery/) attempt to engage an early market that is flourishing due to immense opportunity, but has yet to contract while key players are waiting for the market to choose the winners first. Adjacent projects like [Network Service Mesh](https://networkservicemesh.io/) bring service mesh principles to lower layers of the stack.\n<br/>\n\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meshery in top 3 service mesh developments in 2020","date":"December 12th, 2019","author":"The New Stack","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://thenewstack.io/the-top-3-service-mesh-developments-in-2020/","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBQCdASoUABIAPtFcok4oJSKiKA1RABoJZAC1Gy/lvQwDPxKvEGRfFu90PUVDp1QXgAAA/ufjO56dRxtwAdARiX21W2xYHKwFys8WfnpU3Q8u912iDFv4Yyhpmy0BSZ1fpQ+ikh9JSGSXilJufNsKum3VfZPJAXJeWKrKdBX1RLkiM9SDJKoyFAzgdj3y76yFQiTlVbANwJsHp45bR+OKeWis0LDrCQe9jcPYAs3WCAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp","srcSet":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp 649w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.8921417565485361}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBQCdASoUABIAPtFcok4oJSKiKA1RABoJZAC1Gy/lvQwDPxKvEGRfFu90PUVDp1QXgAAA/ufjO56dRxtwAdARiX21W2xYHKwFys8WfnpU3Q8u912iDFv4Yyhpmy0BSZ1fpQ+ikh9JSGSXilJufNsKum3VfZPJAXJeWKrKdBX1RLkiM9SDJKoyFAzgdj3y76yFQiTlVbANwJsHp45bR+OKeWis0LDrCQe9jcPYAs3WCAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp","srcSet":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp 649w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.8921417565485361}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/meshery-in-top-3-service-mesh-developments-in-2020"}},{"id":"af6a2b2f-425f-5264-b425-98974f7a008a","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\nimport SIG_network from \"./SIG-network-367x200.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<i>By Sean Michael Kerner | <a href=\"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward.html\">Enterprise Networking Planet</a> | Posted Nov 23, 2019</i>\n\n\nSAN DIEGO. The inaugural public meeting the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) was held in a session at the KubeCon event on Nov. 19, ushering in a new era for networking at the highly influential open source group.\n\n<img src={SIG_network} style={{ position: \"relative\", float: \"right\" }} alt=\"SIG-network\" />\n\nThe CNCF is home to many different projects, including the Kubernetes container orchestration system. Kubernetes itself has its' own set of SIGs, which is the core organizing unit for the project, among those SIGs is one for networking. The CNCF however is a bigger organization that just Kubernetes and includes over 40 projects. CNCF SIGs cut across all projects, with cross project concerns in different topic areas.\n\nLee Calcote, Founder at Layer5 and one of the leaders of CNCF TAG Network explained during the session that there are already a few network specific projects within the CNCF, including CNI (Container Network Interface), CoreDNS, Envoy, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS and the Network Service Mesh project.\n\n\"Part of what we're hoping to do is with SIGs in general is to help more impact fully scale the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC),\" Calcote said.\n\nRead more on <a href=\"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward.html\">Enterprise Networking Planet</a>...\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CNCF SIG Network Set to Push Cloud Native Networking Forward","date":"November 23rd, 2019","author":"Enterprise Networking Planet","category":"Coverage","eurl":"","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRq4AAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABgAAQUxQSBMAAAABD9D/iAgICQia/6ddiOh/SpwEAFZQOCB0AAAA8AMAnQEqFAAHAD7RVqNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCUATpAS8FEL+nDaXC8nbDAD+1PUvXMXn++I9oEqEtpsRi0rHvW+J0v72e0e57Jvr+gObap08+6WfR3cnVtfsLs7ZdBAvVvzWCpfNr/rOe8TlOe6EDLVo1pKYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp","srcSet":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp 650w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3692307692307692}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRq4AAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABgAAQUxQSBMAAAABD9D/iAgICQia/6ddiOh/SpwEAFZQOCB0AAAA8AMAnQEqFAAHAD7RVqNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCUATpAS8FEL+nDaXC8nbDAD+1PUvXMXn++I9oEqEtpsRi0rHvW+J0v72e0e57Jvr+gObap08+6WfR3cnVtfsLs7ZdBAvVvzWCpfNr/rOe8TlOe6EDLVo1pKYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp","srcSet":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp 650w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3692307692307692}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward"}},{"id":"8ada4780-d7c3-53ca-9308-b2a9f9bd7e0d","body":"\nimport { NewsWrapper } from \"../../News.style.js\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nKubeCon NA 2019 - San Diego, CA\n\nAt KubeCon 2019, Lee Calcote and Matt Klein introducted the CNCF's latest Special Interest Group for cloud native networking.\n\n<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZ6TZQeNuKQ\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

As an important step toward enabling mainstream developers to be successful, service mesh technology has carved out a place in the microservices landscape. There’s a lot of dust covering the service mesh landscape, and there are more enterprises trying one out than using one in production, but sooner or later, you’ll need a service mesh for your microservices platform.
