I used to find it fascinating how computer programs operate because they have such a tremendous impact on their users. This has always motivated me to work in the field of computers.\n\nAs I grew up, I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more. I started exploring and made projects. The more I understood them, the more interesting they got. Slowly I realized that I don’t want to make projects that satisfy just my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open source projects. \n\n### First PR at Layer5 \nI still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I spotted a <code>[good first issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)</code> tag and expressed interest in working on it despite not knowing what the task was. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions, something I was unaware of at the time. After getting the issue assigned, I started researching what GitHub Actions were. I found out that these actions helped automate workflows to build, test, and deploy software. After getting the basics down, I checked if there were any existing GitHub Actions for the auto labeling of the PR. To my surprise, there were a couple of them. \n\nSo before actually making a PR, I experimented with the actions extensively in my private repo. I remember making about 20-25 PR in my private repo to get the auto labeler working fine. After verifying that I got the desired results, I made a PR. I also got to discuss my approach in the [Meshery Development Call](https://layer5.io/community/calendar). I was so nervous at that time since that was the first meeting I attended where I had to make people understand what I did and the strategies I used. I was quite thrilled when my code got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions. \n\n<img src={aadityaFirstPr} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya's first PR merged\" />\n\n### A Journey Never to forget \n\nMy Layer5 journey began with this small issue. I gradually started learning more about the projects and made some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned new technologies and techniques. Contributing to the codebase gave me so much exposure to React.js, which would not have been possible if I had done it on my own. I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time, I was comfortable with it. I am thankful that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing. I have always applied this principle, learning more by doing actual stuff rather than sitting there and getting stuck in the tutorial loop. \n\nAnother new technology I discovered was Jekyll, a static site generator. I was unfamiliar with this technology as well. I started contributing to issues involving Jekyll and slowly understood the basics and how the language works. I was very happy that I was able to make the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.meshery.io/project/compatibility-matrix), using Jekyll. Even my project for <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">GSoC</Link> is written in Jekyll. So, going from not knowing what Jekyll is, to making some big changes, did make me happy.  \n\nThe community also helped me boost my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meetings required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me get vocal and comfortable with talking to various people. \n\n<img src={aadityaPresenting} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya Presenting\" /> \n\nI am excited to be accepted as a <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</Link> Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. The project assigned to me is to create a dashboard on <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/dashboard\">SMP Website</a>. Results from the [CNCF Cluster labs](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/actions) will be displayed here graphically.  I wish to learn more about cloud native technologies and make contributions on the backend too. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can. \n\n### Appreciation for the Community \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Layer5 Community for always being so supportive whenever I needed it. I took away a very significant lesson from this experience, there is always something to learn, and there is no harm in asking questions if you don't know the answer. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community. There was not a day that I felt completely lost here, and that is what I adore about this community.\n\nKeep Meshing. Thank you.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Journey as a Contributor to GSoC Intern at Layer5","subtitle":"Nothing but a magical experience","date":"July 6th, 2022","author":"Aaditya Narayan Subedy","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/b2bde/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7b988/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 125w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/f2ef5/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 250w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/b2bde/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 500w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/dcb7d/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":226}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/my-journey-as-a-contributor-to-gsoc-intern-at-layer5"}},{"id":"6f2b2a4d-337b-556e-9b63-7f45ddf1d976","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIt all started with my curiosity to find an open-source project with open issues with DevOps and CI/CD labels on them. \nWhile I was searching that on GitHub, I found <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, one of the projects at Layer5. I started going through the \n[README](https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme), and it just felt like that is it. \nIt integrates with all kinds of technologies that I ever wanted to learn and explore. Then I jumped onto their [slack](http://slack.layer5.io/) and got even \nmore excited by the enthusiasm and energy of each community members welcoming me in the newcomers channel. I started attending all the community meetings and \nlearned about the project through the demos/updates from fellow contributors. Slowly and gradually, I started contributing too, then delivering updates in the \ncommunity calls, and consequently started climbing the contributor ladder.\n\nWhen I realised that I would be working on [Layer5 Cloud](https://cloud.layer5.io) and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> as an LFX intern at Layer5, then I couldn't control my excitement. \nThat excitement was to ship more impactful features for the Layer5 projects, work and engage more deeply with the engineering team at Layer5 and have an overall \nupliftment of my development skills.  Throughout my internship I worked on several features. Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding \n[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">performance tests</Link>, \nsupporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, persisting <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with \nLayer5 Cloud, migrating Layer5 Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Layer5 Cloud and exposing performance profiles \n(generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) \nthrough a public facing API.\n\nIn terms of the learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past three months overpowers the education I received in the last two years of college, \nif we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. \nI learned and applied the tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, and NextJS to Postgres, SQL, and GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I got introduced to the topics like \nperformance engineering, service meshes, networking, and several cloud-native tool. While at the same time, I met several experienced developers who are very involved in \nthe communities which revolve around these realms.\n\nOne of the major realizations I got through this internship was that it is okay to make mistakes. There were a few instances where I made mistakes. \nFor instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query which depressed the whole production instance of Layer5 Cloud, which means no one would be able \nto log into Meshery until that gets fixed. Or once I unknowingly used an incorrect default SSH port in a workflow that failed a GitHub action responsible for \npushing the latest Layer5 Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But that was okay, and no one got mad at me, but rather I have \nalways received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I dont repeat it because that is all that matters.\n\nI had a great time as an intern @ Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PRs with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also \nlearned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also learned \nthe true meaning of team spirit. All in all, that was one of the most exquisite experiences I have ever had and ofcourse, the best internship experience \n(considering it was my first internship ever!). \n\nI will be engaged in this community and will keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"LFX Experience at Layer5 - Pranav Singh","subtitle":"An exquisite experience","date":"June 8th, 2022","author":"Pranav Singh","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/41f72/lfx-pranav.webp 125w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/8be43/lfx-pranav.webp 250w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":484.00000000000006}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/lfx-experience-at-layer5-pranav-singh"}},{"id":"e53b3eb0-0923-51eb-837a-f8d12f5a7fe8","body":"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport mentees from './mentees.webp'\nimport meshmate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-icon.svg\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\nTo newbies, open source contributions may seem daunting. In much the same way that non-techies develop a reverence for programmers courtesy of the film industry’s portrayal of them as wizards whose brains magically sprout up elaborate mathematical models and whose mouths eloquently spew technological jargon, so do newbies perceive contributors: a bunch of techies who debug in seconds, recite programming language documentation by heart and, well, create pull requests in their sleep (this is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point).\n</div>\n\n    This perception diminished any notion of our Stack Overflow and W3Schools-dependent selves ever having a shot at open source contribution. It often felt as if we haven’t attained the required caliber of ‘techie-ness’ requisite to join the erudite army of programming soldiers; that our match and stomps wouldn’t match the rhythm of these valiant sergeants.\n  <img src={mentees} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"layer5 mentees\" />\n    However, <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/programs/contributhon-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa’s Contributhon</a> program deconstructs this perception, moreso for women, by partnering with open source organizations like Layer5 and offering women the opportunity to receive mentorship that eases them into being ardent contributors.\n    After a rigorous selection process, we:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyindawodu\">Oyindamola Dawodu</a>, Frontend Developer\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edmucious\">Ednah Akoth</a>, Frontend Developer \n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  gained entry into SCA’s second contributhon program and would like to immerse you in the voyage that the contributhon program was through this article.\n  <h3>The Leaderboard Project</h3>\n    For 8 weeks, we have had the chance to immerse ourselves into Layer5’s open source contribution community by curating a leaderboard for <a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Layer5’s discussion forum</a> to show the most active participants based on various metrics such as likes received and posts created.\n    We built this leaderboard to encourage more intentional communication and exert positive peer pressure on community members, thereby subconsciously incentivising them to give more solutions to problems discussed on the forum, and actively engage with content posted by other members\n    The project has presented an immersive learning experience for us, right from learning how to navigate using the ubuntu terminal, learning how to set up a local discourse development environment and render web pages,  examining the discuss API documentation and understanding the API endpoints needed to fetch the required data and designing the UI (User Interface) of the leaderboard.\n  <h3>Challenges We Faced</h3>\n    Getting acclimated to the intricacies of the discourse development environment has been no easy feat. There were moments where we stared at code on discourse in utter oblivion on its purpose or functionality, or faced version issues that impeded our discourse instance’s ability to run. It sometimes got even more frustrating when something as simple as a fetch instruction that you have been writing for almost the entirety of your programming life fails to work and none of the Stack Overflow fixes work.\n    This question kept us going; How would we become the ardent <em>while in their sleep bug fixers</em> and prolific contributors if we don’t build the fortitude to weather such disheartening moments?\n     During moments like these, the Layer5 community, particularly <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</Link> and our mentors often saved the day, sharing resources or offering explanations on what ought to be done to salvage the situations.\n  <h3>Lessons We Learned Along the Way</h3>\n    Overall, the journey has exercised and built upon our skills repertoire in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Version Control, and induced us into the contribution workflow, right from finding an open issue to work on, setting up the required environment to developing the solution.\n    Furthermore, receiving feedback from both our mentors and members of the Layer5 community with regards to matters like the scalability of our data fetch methods, potential misuse of the leaderboard metrics to gain advantage, the converse outcome that our leaderboard could have (dishearten new members form contributing due to the seemingly low chance of their input reflecting on the board), more responsive UI fixes among others, helped us to become even more cognizant of the idea that we are developing not just for ourselves and our portfolios, but for a wider and greater audience.\n    We became more abreast with the idea of developing for a community or for a greater purpose and the imperative role of feedback in that development process. We became more comfortable with the idea that we essentially do not own the product despite all the sweat we pour into it; we are instead a part of a larger community that comes together to build a widely suitable, sustainable and inclusive product.\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\n    Through building this leaderboard for Layer5’s Community Forum, we have assimilated ourselves into the glorious match of soldiers that previously intimidated us. We stepped foot into the previously deemed insidious territory of open source contribution and realised that we too have a lot to offer in this ecosystem.\n    We have discovered a community of competent, supportive and serial problem-solvers, right from our mentors:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n    <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/ekene-leonard-nwobodo\"><img src={meshmate} style={{ height: \"1.25rem\" }} /> Ekene Leonard Nwobodo</Link>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/etienejames5\">Etiene James</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\">Ruth Ikegah</Link>\n    </li>\n     <li>\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/atinuke-oluwabamikemi-kayode\">Oluwabamikemi Kayode</Link>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n     to the entirety of the contributors, a knowledge powerhouse that we look forward to continue contributing and building towards.\n    Additionally, we would like to convey hearty regards to <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/\">She Code Africa</a> for availing this program as a stepping stone to women like us to get started in OSS.

The Community Bridge Mentorship is a structured remote learning opportunity for aspiring open source software developers. The projects they host are mentored by experienced open source project developers and maintainers.\n\n<h4> Stumbling into Service Mesh Interface (SMI) </h4>\n\nI began working on SMI Conformance testing under the guidance of Lee Calcote, Founder of Layer5, in February 2020. Since then, my path into the world of service meshes has brought me an avalanche of opportunities and has helped me grow by leaps and bounds as a developer.\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a standard interface that encapsulates various common service mesh functionalities. It explains several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), their configuration variables, and their corresponding effect on the service mesh underneath in full detail. What makes SMI vital is that these CRDs are generic, and the specifications are implemented and actively followed up by various service meshes. Some of these service meshes have developed adapters that define SMI CRDs as a wrapper over the APIs they already provide, instead of adhering to the SMI spec internally. SMI specifications address essential features for the most common service mesh use cases:\n\n<img className=\"image-right\" src={smiLogo} alt=\"smi-logo\"/>\n\n- Traffic policy – To apply policies like identity and transport encryption across services\n- Traffic telemetry – To capture key metrics like error rate and latency between services\n- Traffic management – To shift traffic between different services\n\nHowever, at the moment, no service meshes adhere to the SMI specifications completely. Service meshes are rapidly developing and making active efforts to extend their feature set. Simultaneously, SMI has also been working towards adding more features to its specifications.\n\nConsequently, it becomes a necessity for continual validation of service mesh conformance with respect to SMI specifications and  the various versions of those specifications. The process of verifying conformance needs to be standardized and tooling made available.  Hence, our project efforts to create an SMI conformance tool.\n\n<h4> Meshery to the Rescue </h4>\n\nMeshery is the multi-service mesh management plane, offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. It is closely connected to the Kubernetes cluster and allows easy deployment of various service meshes and sample applications onto those meshes. Meshery enables operators to run performance tests on workloads, collect, store, and manage the test results.\n\n\nWe had found our solution. By leveraging the features provided in Meshery, we would be able to focus on the conformance validation and testing instead of sweating over the complexity in deployments. We can also use the performance management infrastructure to manage the conformance tests and their results. And so,  the tool will be developed as an integral part of Meshery to aid and abate SMI conformance woes.\nWe are now enhancing Meshery to automate the process of verifying conformance against a standard set of tests against a sample workload designed specifically for SMI conformance testing. By the time we’re through, this capability of Meshery will allow each project to validate its conformance to each version of the SMI specifications and will provide a detailed report.\n\n<h4> My Projects </h4>\n\nThe goals accomplished in my tenure at Layer5 are summarized as follows:\n\n1. **[Meshery Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility)** - Ported Meshery and its remote provider from using session based authentication to JWT based auth. This opened doors to:\n    - Usage of refresh tokens for longevity of sessions instead of asking user to re-login frequently.\n    - CLI based authentication (not done yet, but is on the roadmap)\n2. **[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub)** - WASM based envoy network packet filters in Rust-lang. Built a demo app demonstrating its potentials; we also built a  WASM filter which performs custom user specific rate limiting. This app was demo’ed in Dockercon 2020 under the header “Service Meshing with Docker Desktop and WebAssembly”.\n3. **[Implementing the Service Mesh Performance Specification](/projects/cloud-native-performance)** - Enhanced Meshery’s performance testing and profile management capabilities. Added support for customizing the requests made by the load generator, and added the capability of using performance test profiles in the tool.\n\nYou can find my code in the [**Learn Layer5 repository**](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/).\n\n<h4> Love for the Community </h4>\n\nI have been actively involved in the Layer5 community for a number of months now and am proud of the contributions I have made to various projects under the Layer5 banner. The Layer5 community represents an eclectic mix of geeky developers, out of the box thinkers, sassy writers and some of the most amazing people I have met so far in the open source community.  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment, and operational best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, and more. I am truly ecstatic to be a part of such an enthusiastic and welcoming community.<br/>\n\nAs you’ve made it to the end of my post, why not stick around and take a look at the amazing projects I just described? You might just find your dream project and if not, I can promise that you will at least end up becoming a part of one of the best open source communities out there.<br/>\nTo stay tuned with the progress of the project, please join us in the [Slack](http://slack.layer5.io) channel!\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CommunityBridge 2020: Teaching service meshes to be compliant","subtitle":"","date":"July 16th, 2020","author":"Kanishkar J","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/7513b/communitybridge.webp 750w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/317ed/communitybridge.webp 1080w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5233333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/92a0a/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/971ea/communitybridge.webp 125w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/88ea2/communitybridge.webp 250w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/92a0a/communitybridge.webp 500w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/2d60a/communitybridge.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":262}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/communitybridge-2020-teaching-service-meshes-to-be-compliant"}},{"id":"933fdd2b-b2a4-5371-bb9a-f047b72e3e23","body":"import { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport smilogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\nimport checklist from \"./checklist.svg\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img\n\tsrc={smilogo}\n\talign=\"right\"\n\talt=\"smilogo\"\n\twidth=\"200px\"\n\tstyle={{ margin: \"1rem 2rem\" }}\n/>\n\n### About SMI\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at [SMI Github Repository](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec). Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found [here](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md).\n\n### APIs in SMI\n\nCurrently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:\n\n- [Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs) - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.\n- [Traffic Access Control](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control) - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not\n- [Traffic Split](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split) - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing\n- [Traffic Metrics](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics) - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.\n\n### About SMI Conformance Tests\n\n**SMI Conformance Tests** check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?\n\nAll these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.\n\nSounds fun, right? Let's dig deeper into the SMI conformance project and find out.\n\n### Meshery'ing with Conformance Tests\n\n<img src={checklist} align=\"left\" alt=\"checklist\" width=\"250px\"/>\n\n<Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>  is _the cloud native management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.\n\nAs you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nDo you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).\n\n#### Forking [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/)\n\n`kuttl` is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It's entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked `kuttl` and modified it a little. You can see our modified version [here](https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl).\n\n\nWe are planning to use `kuttl` for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of `kuttl`.\n\n#### [Learn Layer5](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/)\n\nLearn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.\n\nThis is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and `smi-conformance` testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.\n\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.\nHead over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback.

I have had a run-in with the Kubernetes community before and initially believed Kubernetes to be the final stage of DevOps, but I was happily surprised when I found out that the end of Kubernetes merely marked the entrypoint to a whole new world of service meshes.\nAnd so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2020 internship, which began on the night of May 3rd, 2020 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Admittedly, I had tried my best an year ago to get into GSoC’19 with another organisation but due to reasons only Google can tell you, I was not accepted. Everything happens for a reason though, right?\nSix months ago, if you would have told me that I would be working with service meshes, gRPC, load testing, performance benchmarking alongside prominent members of the open source world of Cloud Native, I would have ignored you with the least possible amount of prudence I could muster.\n<h4>What is my project about?</h4>\nMy GSoC project is to <strong>Enable Distributed Load Testing for various Service Mesh Planes using Envoy Nighthawk</strong>. For those who are not familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a>, it is a performance benchmark tool written and maintained by the Envoy community. We are in the process of incorporating Nighthawk into <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> - <i>the cloud native management plane</i>.Meshery already supports performance testing of service meshes using fortio & wrk2 and is maintained by the Layer5 community and is also a member of CNCF Landscape. Alongside this effort, we are creating a new industry standard: <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance Specification</Link> which is another initiative of the Layer5 community to establish a common format for describing and capturing service mesh performance.\nIt has  been a month since I have started my GSoC’20 tenure with the Layer5 community, and in this month, I have learned a lot from my code contributions and mentor. I began with setting up the project roadmap and discussing the potential use cases of Nighthawk with its maintainers during my community bonding period. I came to know some incredible people during the community bonding from big tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Affirmed Networks, Red Hat and many more to list. Before incorporating Nighthawk, we had to make various enhancements in Meshery, like adding user preferences for performance settings, specifying the SMPS format for exporting and importing of load-test preferences, load-generator interface and more.\nI have learned a hoard of new things, like gRPC services and how they communicate using protocol buffers, load generation using fortio, writing handlers for various endpoints using golang, and some frontend architecture with Nextjs.\n<h4>About the community</h4>\nLayer5 has one of the healthiest open source communities that I have ever worked with. In the past, I have worked with a variety of well-maintained and large scale open source communities but I have never experienced a more welcoming and nurturing environment than Layer5. At Layer5, we respect each contributor and their contributions, whether it is a new adapter or just a typo fix. If you can contribute, please do. It’s that simple! With many awesome initiatives like SMPS, Distributed Load Testing, Performance Benchmarking, Learn Layer5, and Image Hub, the exponential increase of Layer5 and its various projects is inevitable.\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Summer of Code 2020: Service Mesh Performance with Envoy Nighthawk","subtitle":"One of the greatest learning experiences yet.","date":"June 23rd, 2020","author":"Kush Trivedi","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/d1572/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/16e88/gsoc-wide.webp 125w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/f1e1b/gsoc-wide.webp 250w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/d1572/gsoc-wide.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":297}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/google-summer-of-code-2020-service-mesh-performance-with-envoy-nighthawk"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Programs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1485533831","4047814605","408154852","4152005505"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/blog/tag/programs"}
