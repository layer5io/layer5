The story just gets better. This podcast goes deep into service meshes, load generators, circuit breaker, service mesh patterns in addition to a live demo of <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and more. Hosted by Henrik from Perfbytes and joined by Mark, <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\">Lee Calcote</Link> from Layer5 and Mrittika Ganguli from Intel. Tune in to find out more. Get answers to all community questions as a bonus.\n<h3>What is a service mesh?</h3>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nService mesh is one of the solutions that helps you to route traffic within your cluster so as to expose your services outside the cluster. It is a solution to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. You have different options like the service type load balancer or using ingress but service mesh makes sense because it will manage a lot of features around your service to service communication.\n\n</div>\n\nIn general, service meshes arose from the concept of proxies such as the NGINX proxy. Then Envoy was introduced by Lyft. Lyft had the architecture, and Google came along and created it. That gave us Istio, which is now part of CNCF. \n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"We were slugging it out in our labs trying to figure out how to do performance benchmarking with a service mesh. Instead of ten tools, if we had just one, it would be nice. Then we see Meshery come into the field\"\n  person=\"Mrittika\"\n/>\n\nService meshes, according to Lee, \"hit a real sweet spot personally\", having been focused on networking for most part of his career.\nHe believes that there are a couple of different ways to speak about the genesis of service meshes, with Linkerd being the first to coin the term.\nWe had Linkerd v1 written in scala and use jvm and then came Linkerd v2 which is something totally different at this point. It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed. There's a new one that's been softly announced in beta from called Cilium that is helping bring back some of the different architectures of how to run the proxies.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n\nThe way I prefer to think about a surface mesh is that it's all about resiliency.\nIf you were to take a three-tiered web or three-tiered app and you think about how you're breaking out those tiers with some amount of\nkind of vertical scaling,  you'd probably, end up putting at least a virtual IP address out in front of the whole web tier and then you've got an app tier and a database tier because you've got multiple instances of those things. Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\n\n</div>\n\nHenrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable. \nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\nHenrik recalled that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and when he first saw Meshery, his immediate thought was, \"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\"\n\n\nLets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n\n<h3>Meshery</h3>\nIf you were on a pager and were managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff. You might soil myself if you had to go make a change in that sea of yaml. That's in part what we're working towards. There's a capability within Meshery for solving this challenge. As a cloud native management plane, Meshery presides over top of 10 different types of service meshes and it also presides over kubernetes. You can run it outside of kubernetes or inside of kubernetes.\nMeshery has a number of components to its architecture. There is Meshery UI. It has a Mesheryctl, which is a CLI component. We have a number of service mesh adapters for each service mesh that Meshery supports.\n<h5>What is the need for different adapters?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nMeshery, as the multi-mesh manager, supports couple of different adapters. Adapters are used by Meshery to manage the numerous service meshes. Different service mesh adapters are written to expose the unique value of each service mesh. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each service mesh is not equally capable as the other. Some of them work in a similar way. Some of the service meshes have their own differentiated value, which is why there are individual adapters. Some of them work slightly differently depending on whether they're running as a managed service or not.\n\n</div>\n\n\nWe have a plug-in for Meshery it's called <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>, it is what you might consider a visual topology. It has a lot of use cases for observing in kind of a read-only mode. There's a second mode to this tool: The Designer Mode. It's a visual configurator of not only the specific settings within any of those service meshes that it supports like a circuit breaker and adjusting the sensor video\nbut also end up being a visual designer for your kubernetes deployments. When users drop in, they're able to go over and grab the specific capabilities of any of those service mesh adapters that are loaded for any of the versions of that mesh that they might want to design. The concept here is that they drag and drop these capabilities over and there's a bit of discoverability that's afforded through this ui rather than parsing through yaml, trying to understand what's going on.\n\n<img src={ConsulDemo} alt=\"Consul MeshMap Demo\" className=\"slides-right\"/>\n\nI like to pretend that I know a lot about service meshes, but when it comes to having to keep track of all of them, I don't know what the gateway tls sds config is, and so this type of inline help is quite useful to design your deployments. The deployments may or may not use a mesh; in fact, you can use this to create your Kubernetes configuration and deployment as well.  You can even save and recall those designs.\n\nTaking this example of consul, produced by hashicorp, is a little more of an\nintriguing deployment and a simple two-tier deck.  We announced the <Link to=\"/docker-extension-meshery\">Meshery Docker Extension</Link> recently. So if you're using docker desktop, Meshery will be a first class app that's available inside of market and part of what it does as it integrates with docker desktop is it will import docker compose apps convert them to kubernetes manifests or kubernetes apps and they'll let you deploy those formerly docker compose apps onto a mesh which is why I'm talking about a two-tiered service.\n\n<h5>Does MeshMap allow you to load the current configuration that is has been applied in the current cluster?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nCurrently, there are two modes: the one we were looking at before was the designer mode, and the one we'll be looking at now is the visualizer mode, which is probably a little more of an it's not entirely read-only to the extent that you could grab a pod and start an interactive session with the containers in that pod or you could you start a logging session. You could also initiate a performance test against  that particular service or that particular endpoint. \nMeshery supports three different types of load generators, which is a nighthawk, fortio and wrk2. \n\n</div>\n\n<h5>What are the capabilities of these three load generators? When you speak about service mesh testing or performance testing, what is actually the process behind the scene? What should users think about when they're starting a gig and need to configure and optimize the service mesh?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nLee expounds on that for our benefit. \nIt takes weeks to months that you've got to dedicate for performance engineers to go over and like pull together various tools and scripts around them to then get into a spreadsheet or into some database that you then generate results. \nThe genesis of Meshery part was to help people comprehend what a service mesh is, when to use one and which one to use?  As you go to explain these common questions, the real answer is a totally disappointing, which is, it just depends on what you're asking to do.\nPeople want to measure it in cold hard quantitative metrics but if you're asking to do 100 percent sampling then also consider the distributed tracing implementation you had somewhere else and the fact that you're getting it\nin a uniform way here. Maybe you're likely to consider the overhead that you would have over there. It's frustrating to be trying to explain stuff to folks and get them excited about the tech and and to give them a vague response. Instead we give them a tool that says \"Hey look here's a tool that will deploy any of the service meshes that you want to test out.\"\nThere's a reason why there's ten of them like and actually many more than that.\nThere's a lot of overlap between them but different tools for different purposes for different size orgs, so it would be inappropriate to say well you know here's the one. It's rather hey here's a tool that that lets you deploy any number of them quickly, answer your own question about performance, because we can pump out benchmarks of the various service meshes under various configurations, using different types of workloads but which may or may not match your environment and over time those reports are going to get stale and so rather he's a tool to make you empowered.\n\n</div>\n\n<h5>Do you actually generate traffic that will go through the sidecar proxy of the service and then reach out the actual service?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nThat load is generated on demand or on schedule against one or more endpoints, one or more of your services or something that is not even on your service. You can generate load not only against something running within your infrastructure but something external as well to do statistical analysis based on the configuration that you gave it and so yeah the answer is yes the traffic flows through the sidecar.\n\n</div>\n\n<h5>If I say I have never scripted or built any scenarios for fortio or nighthawk. Let's say I'm a loadrunner, a neoload, or a k6 user, and I want to accomplish the same thing with them. So what is the journey on those load generator? is it the same thing you have to build a workflow of requests that you want to send in that scenario?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nThat leads us to probably talk about one of our other projects which is called <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\"> Performance</Link> which is a specification. It's another one of the projects that we've donated to the CNCF. Service Mesh Performance is the spec while Meshery is an implementation of the spec. \nAt a high level, if those other load generators were to adhere to how we standardize and describe the test that you want to run and then hand off that configuration to generate the performance profiles that are created here  you're not gonna down download them but the descriptor is important.\nThis implements a standard for the industry on what is the actual\nservice mesh test and then standardize the format so then anyone can use the same format to design their script or whatever they want and then use it to test. \nSo when I build a script, and I don't know loadrunner today and I want to use neologo tomorrow, then I don't have to rewrite everything.

Cloud native architectures call for horizontally scalable, distributed systems design with microservices proliferated from Cloud to Edge. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network’s objective is to enable widespread and effective development, deployment, and operation of resilient and intelligent network systems in cloud native environments, keeping an eye on the needs of workloads, developers who design them, and operators who manage them.\n    Lee Calcote (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lcalcote\">@lcalcote</a>) is an innovative product and technology leader, passionate about empowering engineers and enabling organizations. As the founder and CEO of Layer5, he is at the forefront of the cloud native movement. Ken Owens (<a href =\"https://twitter.com/kenowens12\">@kenowens12</a>) is the Vice President, Cyber Cloud Security Engineering at FISERV. Owens is a technologist and an innovator with more than 20+ years of experience in a plethora of technologies and has been championing the cloud native movement for more than a decade now.\n    As an introduction to TAG Network, Owens  describes  the group’s  core objectives and reasons for its formation, summarized below:\n<ul>\n<li>Listening to ideas and collaborations</li>\n<li>Assisting and attracting projects</li>\n<li>Building communities and providing impartial stewardship</li>\n</ul>\n    Calcote and Owens are frequently asked a common question <em>“Is it important for the organization to be a part of CNCF to participate in the TAG Network group?”</em>. Owens emphasizes that anyone can participate, regardless of whether or not their company is a CNCF member organization. It does not require any payment and is an open-source effort in its spirit.\n<h3>CNCF TAG Network Projects and various stages they go through:</h3>\n<img src={Projects} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Tag Networks Projects\" />\n\n    One of the important goals of the TAG Network is to identify the unique projects that want to participate and shepherd their journey through CNCF project levels. Project-fit and the process of assessment for inclusion in the CNCF require your project to be on terms with the following essential traits:\n<ul>\n<li>Uniqueness</li>\n<li>Problem it solves</li>\n<li>Value it brings to the community</li> \n<li>Market demand</li>\n<li>Diversification </li>\n</ul>\n    Creating and stewarding any one of these projects is a significant undertaking. The  project's maintainers pitch the project and explicate how their project meets the above traits.\n    You start in a sandbox and work your way up to an incubation area once you've demonstrated a fundamental interest and understanding of the space, as well as some adoption. To graduate, the project must satisfy the required traits, be open-source, provide value and solve a problem effectively. We don't want to promote a CNCF project that is solely driven by one source. Diversification is crucial to the core of any CNCF project. Owens shared a subtle analogy, <em>\"a truly open source project is one in which contributors belong to the companies A+B+C...Z instead of just company A\"</em>\n<h4>Working Groups and papers, and how they work.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Data Plane API and Service Mesh WG are the two working groups stewarded by TAG Network.</li>\n<li>They utilize Kubecon to educate about the functioning of working groups.</li>\n<li>Whitepapers and publications are carried out by working group members. A Recent publication was published in the IEEE Bridge magazine, entitled <Link to=\"/resources/service-mesh-performance/analyzing-service-mesh-performance\">Analyzing Service Mesh Performance</Link>.</li>\n<li>Further goals include getting into the IEEE Communications Society and publishing an article entitled Techniques of Service Mesh Optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe majority of the more detailed activities occur in the CNCF Service Mesh Working Group - a subgroup of TAG Network. The deep-dive unveiled many individual initiatives, the majority of which have a common thread: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Meshery is the cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of workloads.\n\n    It's a Meshy world out there! As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. Calcote gives us a walkthrough of two Service Mesh Specifications:\n<ul>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI):</Link></b> SMI focuses on the interoperability of the various features of a service mesh.</li>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance (SMP):</Link></b> SMP tries to make it uniform and succinct the way you characterize the performance of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src={Smi} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{ marginLeft: \"10px\" }} alt=\"SMI\" />\n<img src={Smp} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{ marginLeft: \"10px\" }} alt=\"SMP\" />\n    Owens and Calcote also discuss <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link> and Service Mesh Catalog. These patterns promote the reuse of best practices, are service mesh agnostic, and also help in behavior analysis. A circuit breaker test is a good example.  If something goes wrong in your network be it a node failure, router failure, etc., then it helps you identify the point of failure as well as gets your network running quickly.\n<img\n    src={Catalog}\n    className=\"slides\"\n    alt=\"Service Mesh Catalog\"\n    style={{ display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\" }}\n/>\n\n\n    Talking about distributed systems, we come across the problem of distributed analysis. In this talk, the TAG Network co-chairs help us understand this problem and why we must worry about it.\n<ul>\n<li>Many performance characterizing tools are limited to single instance load generators. This limits the amount of traffic and the variety of behavioral analysis.</li>\n<li>Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles.</li>\n<li>How to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before deploying to production. </li>\n</ul>\n    This brings us to <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Together they help produce robust, distributed and scalable services. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.\n<img\n    src={Gnh}\n    className=\"slides\"\n    style={{ display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\" }}\n    alt=\"GetNighthawk\"\n />\n\n<strong>Calcote and Owens packed a great deal of information in this talk.

Let’s examine what each specification provides.\n<img src={smpLogo} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" alt=\"service mesh performance logo\"/><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance</a> standardizes service mesh value measurement, characterizing any deployment's performance by capturing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration and workload metadata.\n<img src={smiLogo} className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"service mesh interface logo\"/><a href=\"https://smi-spec.io\">Service Mesh Interface</a> provides a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. These (currently) four specfications offer a common denominator set of interfaces to support most common service mesh use cases and the flexibility to evolve to support new service mesh capabilities over time.\nAs a service mesh agnostic tool that provides lifecycle and performance management of a large number of (10+) service meshes, Kubernetes applications, service mesh patterns and WebAssembly filters, Meshery is the ideal tool for the job when it comes to implementing these specifications.\nMeshery also comes with two new GitHub Actions that do exactly this. The <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smi-conformance-action\">Meshery SMI Conformance Action</a> which <a href=\"https://meshery.io/blog/validating-smi-conformance-with-meshery\">validates SMI conformance</a> in your pipeline and the <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action\">Meshery SMP Action</a> which runs <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management\">SMP compatible performance benchmarks</a>.\nBut how do we use these actions? What do they offer? Let’s find out!\n<h2>Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action</h2>\n\nConformance of SMI specifications is defined as a series of test assertions. These test assertions are categorised by SMI specification (of which, there are currently four specifications) and comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. Conformance requirements will change appropriately as each new version of the SMI spec is released. Refer to Meshery's documentation for details of how <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/service-mesh-interface\">Meshery performs SMI conformance</a>.\n<img src={githubBlack} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" style={{maxWidth:\"9vw\"}}/>\n\n<h3>Using Meshery's SMI Conformance GitHub Action</h3>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/service-mesh-interface-conformance-with-meshery\">Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action</a> is available in the GitHub Marketplace. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event.\nAn example of the action configuration which runs on every release is shown below. The action handles setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying the service mesh (see supported service meshes), running the conformance tests and reporting back the results to the SMI Conformance dashboard in Meshery.\n```yaml\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: false\n```\n\nYou can also bring in their own cluster with specific capabilities and with a service mesh already installed.\n```yaml\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - 'master'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance tests on master\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Install OSM\n        run: |\n           curl -LO https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/v0.9.1/osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           tar -xzf osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           mkdir -p ~/osm/bin\n           mv ./linux-amd64/osm ~/osm/bin/osm-bin\n           PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/osm/bin/\"\n           osm-bin install --osm-namespace default\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: true\n```\n\nYou can download a token from Meshery and add it as a GitHub secret (in the example above, the secret is <code>MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN</code>). After the test is run, you can view the results from the Service Mesh Interface dashboard in Meshery UI.\n<p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}><img src={smidashboard} className=\"image-center-shadow\" style={{width:\"70%\"}} alt=\"smi conformance dashboard\" /></p>\n<i>Meshery's Service Mesh Interface Conformance Results</i>\nParticipating projects can also automatically report their conformance test results to the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/service-mesh-interface\">SMI Conformance dashboard</a>\n\n<h2>Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</h2>\n\nMeasuring and managing the performance of a service mesh is key to efficient operation of any service mesh. Meshery is the canonical implementation of the Service Mesh Performance specification. You can choose from multiple load generators and use a highly configurable set of load profiles with variable tunable facets to run a performance test. Meshery packages all these features into an easy-to-use GitHub Action.\n<img src={githubBlack} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" style={{maxWidth:\"9vw\"}}/>\n\n<h3>Using Meshery's Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</h3>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/performance-testing-with-meshery\">Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</a> is available in the GitHub Marketplace.You can create your own performance profiles to run repeatable tests with Meshery. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event. A sample configuration of the action is shown below.\n```yaml\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n```\n\nYou can also define your test configuration in an SMP compatible configuration file as shown below.\n```yaml\nsmp_version: v0.0.1\nid:\nname: Istio Performance Test\nlabels: {}\nclients:\n- internal: false\n  load_generator: fortio\n  protocol: 1\n  connections: 2\n  rps: 10\n  headers: {}\n  cookies: {}\n  body: \"\"\n  content_type: \"\"\n  endpoint_urls:\n  - http://localhost:2323/productpage\nduration: \"30m\"\n```\n\nSee this sample GitHub workflow (<a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/blob/master/action.yml\">action.yml</a>) for more configuration details.\n<img src={perfdashboard} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"performance management dashboard\"/>\n\nThe results from the tests are updated on the Performance Management dashboard in Meshery.

In this talk, he walked through service mesh specifications and why they matter in your deployment.\n   How many service mesh specifications do you know? He went through all of them. So, no worries if you're unfamiliar.\n\n</div>   \n\n### Service Mesh Specifications:\n<img src={Abstractions} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"abstractions\"/>\n\nAs the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. The Service Mesh Interface (SMI), the Service Mesh Performance (SMP), and Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) are three open specifications solving the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service meshes. \n\nLearn what makes each of them unique and why they are much needed. See each of these three specifications in action as we use Meshery, the open-source service mesh management plane to demonstrate the value and functionality of each service mesh abstraction, and the adherence of these specifications by Istio, Linkerd, Consul and other popular service meshes.\n\n### Cloud native Journey to service meshes:\n\n<img src={Journey} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"journey-image\"/>\n\nThe advent of cloud native was the popularization of containers. Thank you Docker! From there, containers took off like wildfire. Turns out you need an orchestrator to wrangle that sprawl. We saw a number of orchestrators come and we still have a number of orchestrators around.\n\nService meshes have become a hot topic in the last few years. They still continue to be, rightfully so, a very powerful piece of technology. “A lot of the power is yet to come from my perspective. For my part, I believe that there is a tomorrow in which data plane intelligence really matters. And matters about how people write cloud native applications.”, Lee emphasized. Not everyone quite understands the capabilities of meshes as they are promoted and spoken about today. So come along into the journey of service mesh.\n\nThere are a number of service meshes out there. One of the community projects is to track the landscape of all of the meshes there are. There’s a lot to say about each of them, their architecture, and their working. Why are they made? Who are they focused on? What do they do? When did they come about? Why are some of them not here anymore? Why are we still seeing new ones? A lot of things to go through. You might be interested in any number of the details that the landscape tracks.\n <div className=\"note\">Be Aware, It's Meshy Out There!</div>\n\n### Service Mesh Interface\n<img src={SMI} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"smi-image\"/>\n- Its goal and genesis were born inside of Kubernetes.\n- Being a specification that is native to Kubernetes, its focus is on lowest common denominator functionality.\n- The focus on bringing forth APIs that highlight and reinforce the most common use cases that service meshes are being used for currently\n- Leaves space and provides extensibility room for additional APIs to address other service mesh functionality as more people adopt and make use cases well known.\n- There are seven service meshes that claim compatibility with SMI. There's been a community effort, open-source effort to create service mesh conformance tests to assert whether or not a given service mesh is compatible with SMI\n- In order to facilitate those types of tests, you need to have a tool to provision a sample application on those services which will generate load and test whether traffic splitting behaves as expected or works with that service mesh implementation properly.\n- Then you need to be able to collect the results, guarantee the provenance of those results and publish them.\n- As a community, we turned to Meshery as the tool to implement <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link> and we have been working with the individual service meshes to validate their conformance.\n<b>Meshery</b>\n- We work on an open-source project called <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n- Meshery, the cloud native management plane, is the canonical implementation of the service mesh performance.\n- The management planes can do a number of things to help bridge the divide between other back-end systems and service meshes. They also help performance management, configuration management, making sure you are following best practices in your implementations by taking common patterns and applying them to your environment\nLet's take a moment to demo what it looks like to validate conformance in SMI using Meshery.\n\n<img src={Graph} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"graph\"/>\n- We need to spin up Meshery locally\n- We use mesheryctl as the command line interface to work with Meshery.\n- We can interact with a number of different service mesh. The service mesh we’re going to work with today is an Open service mesh (one of those 7 that is compatible with SMI). Let’s put it to the test.\n- We'll initiate <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link>\n- These tests go and do assertions across these different specifications. We’re looking at traffic access, traffic splitting, traffic specification. Meshery then collects these results and will eventually be publishing them in combination with the SMI project.\n\n### Service Mesh Performance\n<img src={SMP} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"smp-image\"/>\n- Focused on describing and capturing the performance of a service mesh.\n- The overhead of the value is another way of looking at it and characterizing it.\n- Trying to characterize the performance of the infrastructure of a service mesh can be really difficult.\n- Considering the number of variables that you would have to track, how difficult it can be to have repeatable tests, and benchmark your environment, to track your history based on your environment, compare performance between other meshes people need.\n- SMP creates a standard way of capturing the performance of the mesh to help with these issues.\n- It's also the way in which you're configuring your control plan of your service mesh.\n\nYou might be using a client library to do some service mesh functionality. Maybe you're using those in combination with the service mesh. What costs more? What's more efficient? What's more powerful? Maybe you're using web assembly and filters there.\nThese are all open questions that <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">SMP</Link> assists in answering in your environment. You’d be surprised by some of the results of some tests that we have done and that the community has done in combination with a couple of universities and graduate students.\n\n<b>Performance Test</b>\n\nDemonstration of the implementation of service mesh Performance:\n\n<img src={Flowchart} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"flowchart\"/>\n- On the terminal, we have a local deployment of Meshery running. You can also deploy on Kubernetes as well as the vendor Kubernetes platforms like AKS, EKS and GCP or you can use a dockerized container to run Meshery. You can also have your Kubernetes on Docker desktop.\n- We have the Open service mesh deployed.\n- The Meshery UI is exposed at 9081 port. This is the UI which is used to instantiate a Load test.\n- Over here you can see we have 3 load generators fortio, wrk2, nighthawk.\n- All of these load generators have their own set of attributes which they record correctly and each of its attributes have their own significance. We begin with fortio.\n- <img src={Bucket} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"graph\"/>\n\n- You can actually download the test results or you can just browse into the Results Tab and see all of the tests which you have run until now.\n- Next, we used nighthawk to generate the load and benchmark the service for the same. Nighthawk is a load generator which is maintained by the Envoy community and is relatively new. It still hasn't got its 1.0 release but right now Nighthawk has sufficient features to compete with different generators which are still in the play. It can generate a gRPC service on its own and it has some more attributes which you can expose using their CLI tools.\n- You can also see that Meshery has the capability to search your environment, see what specifications are being used and what's the load on your Kubernetes.\n- Jump into the results Tab and see how we compare with these results.\n- You can click on the download. You will see that a yaml gets downloaded in which you can browse and see that the start time, load time, the performance latencies, the metrics are being captured.\n\n### Hamlet or Multi-vendor Service Mesh Interoperation\n<img src={Hamlet} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"hamlet-image\"/>\n- Focus on service mesh federation\n- Specifies a set of API standards for enabling service mesh federation\n- Hamlet takes on a client-server architecture in which resources and services of one service mesh are discovered, registered and using a common format, information about them is exchanged between different service mesh.\n- Rules around authentication and authorization rules around which Services get exposed and to whom and who can communicate with them and whether or not they can do it securely. These are things that Hamlet addresses.\n- The specification currently consists of two APIs:\n    - **The Federated Resource Discovery API**: API to authenticate and securely distribute resources between federated service meshes.\n    - The **Federated Service Discovery API**: API to discover, reach, authenticate and securely communicate with federated services.\n- Part of the real power is the ability to overcome what are likely to be separate administrative domains. The intention here is to marry up connect two disparate service mesh deployments, those deployments might be of the same type, they might be of two different types.\n\nIn addition to SMI, SMP and Hamlet there has been an emergence of service mesh patterns, by which people are running and operating service meshes. There is a service mesh working group under CNCFs network that is helping identify those patterns of which there's a list right now unbeknownst to you. Reach out, join it, help us work through the 60 patterns that are defined right now. 30 of those are going into an <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books\">O’Reilly</Link> book called <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link>.\n\nSomething that isn’t always obvious to folks is this piece of value that people get from a service mesh and actually from the specifications that we were just mentioning. It is the fact that teams are decoupled when you’re running a mesh. Developers get to iterate a bit independently of operators, and so do operators get to make changes to implement infrastructure to the way that applications behave independent of developers in the presence of a mesh.  Both of these teams are significantly empowered. Everybody gets a piece of power when they deploy a mesh.\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite  come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter","subtitle":null,"date":"September 20th, 2021","author":"Debopriya Bhattacharjee","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/cd07d/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/46142/Cover-image.webp 125w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/81c3e/Cover-image.webp 250w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/cd07d/Cover-image.webp 500w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/bf95e/Cover-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":281}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/service-mesh/service-mesh-specifications-and-why-they-matter"}},{"id":"7802e907-ecf2-5e60-93ed-04551ee7687f","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport smpImg from \"./smp.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### What is performance benchmarking and why should you care?\n\nMany of you may remember that the HBO streaming service crashed when the final season of the popular sitcom, Game of Thrones went live on the service. Unable to engage all the user requests, the streaming service and the website broke down and ultimately resulted in DoS (Denial of Service). There are numerous examples of service crashes across different platforms, which has forced developers to take a closer look at performance benchmarking and pre-launch performance checks.\n\nThere are several advantages of preliminary service benchmarking, which may extensively enhance the response time, resolve glitches, enhance the application's robustness, and bring together several other commendable factors, including but not limited to stability and dependability within an application.\n\nThere are several tools for performance benchmarking. A major one is the interconnected relationship between load generators and benchmarks. Some of the well-known load generators in the cloud native realm are:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Fortio</li>\n    <li>Wrk2/Wrk</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nThe conclusion can be encapsulated as following, Meshery, the cloud native management plane possesses the ability to generate load and benchmark services in/out of your service mesh using Fortio, Wrk2 and now, Nighthawk too.\n\n### Meshery + Nighthawk = Robust Distributed and Scalable Services\n\nNighthawk, written and maintained by the Envoy Community, is a L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool that supports performance benchmarking using HTTP or gRPC services.\n\nNighthawk is built using open-source builds and test tool Bazel and supports output formatting to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards. To add more to the list, it will soon support distributed performance benchmarking which is currently under an active development stage.\n\nOn the other hand, Meshery, written and maintainer by Layer5 Community is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. With Meshery, you can both, manage your service mesh's lifecycle, and benchmark them with industry-grade tools to let you know how much under or over-utilized your services are.\n\n<img src={smpImg} alt=\"smp-image\" className=\"image-left smp-image\"/>\n\nSoon, Meshery is going to be a canonical implementation for [Service Mesh Performance](https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance) which is a common and standardised format to describe : - Performance test configuration - Service mesh configuration - Environment configuration - Workload configuration - Performance test results.\n\n### How did we achieve it ?\nThe following project was proposed as a Google Summer of Code Idea, I was selected as a student mentee to draft the design, architecture and code my way from scratch. On my journey, I received guidance from some amazing mentors, colleagues and open-source stake holders. I discussed the design proposal with Envoy Team as well as Layer5 Team and from suggestions from both, I was able to complete my project.\n\nIn the course of the project, I came up with the idea of invoking Nighthawk as a separate container with which Meshery will communicate using a go-lang based middleware.\n\nTo my elation, the project was a huge success and Nighthawk is now invoked as a load-generator in Meshery. Soon, the public release for the new version will be made and users will be able to utilize Nighthawk as a performance-benchamark tool alongside with Fortio and Wrk2.\n\n### What's next?\nThis is just the first relay, in the long run, there are many more milestones to come. The following is a list of projects which will be completed in upcoming months:\n\n- Invoke Nighthawk as an gRPC Service and support gRPC connection between Nighthawk & Meshery.\n- Implement user-profiles for performance benchmarking which may store some preset preferred values according to users.\n- Enhance Nighthawk to support distributed load generation and performance benchmarking.\n- NATS & gRPC Performance Benchmarking for gRPC and NATS services invoked in Meshery.\n\nand many more awesome and bleeding-edge ideas.\n\n### How can I get involved?\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it. Head over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #performance channel where everything related to performance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback.

Before being accepted as a Google Summer of Code intern, I had been working with the Layer5 community as an active contributor, exploring various new DevOps tooling like service meshes, the sidecar concept, and performance benchmarking of services. I have had a run-in with the Kubernetes community before and initially believed Kubernetes to be the final stage of DevOps, but I was happily surprised when I found out that the end of Kubernetes merely marked the entrypoint to a whole new world of service meshes.\nAnd so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2020 internship, which began on the night of May 3rd, 2020 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Admittedly, I had tried my best an year ago to get into GSoC’19 with another organisation but due to reasons only Google can tell you, I was not accepted. Everything happens for a reason though, right?\nSix months ago, if you would have told me that I would be working with service meshes, gRPC, load testing, performance benchmarking alongside prominent members of the open source world of Cloud Native, I would have ignored you with the least possible amount of prudence I could muster.\n<h4>What is my project about?</h4>\nMy GSoC project is to <strong>Enable Distributed Load Testing for various Service Mesh Planes using Envoy Nighthawk</strong>. For those who are not familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a>, it is a performance benchmark tool written and maintained by the Envoy community. We are in the process of incorporating Nighthawk into <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> - <i>the cloud native management plane</i>.Meshery already supports performance testing of service meshes using fortio & wrk2 and is maintained by the Layer5 community and is also a member of CNCF Landscape. Alongside this effort, we are creating a new industry standard: <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance Specification</Link> which is another initiative of the Layer5 community to establish a common format for describing and capturing service mesh performance.\nIt has  been a month since I have started my GSoC’20 tenure with the Layer5 community, and in this month, I have learned a lot from my code contributions and mentor. I began with setting up the project roadmap and discussing the potential use cases of Nighthawk with its maintainers during my community bonding period. I came to know some incredible people during the community bonding from big tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Affirmed Networks, Red Hat and many more to list. Before incorporating Nighthawk, we had to make various enhancements in Meshery, like adding user preferences for performance settings, specifying the SMPS format for exporting and importing of load-test preferences, load-generator interface and more.\nI have learned a hoard of new things, like gRPC services and how they communicate using protocol buffers, load generation using fortio, writing handlers for various endpoints using golang, and some frontend architecture with Nextjs.\n<h4>About the community</h4>\nLayer5 has one of the healthiest open source communities that I have ever worked with. In the past, I have worked with a variety of well-maintained and large scale open source communities but I have never experienced a more welcoming and nurturing environment than Layer5. At Layer5, we respect each contributor and their contributions, whether it is a new adapter or just a typo fix. If you can contribute, please do. It’s that simple! With many awesome initiatives like SMPS, Distributed Load Testing, Performance Benchmarking, Learn Layer5, and Image Hub, the exponential increase of Layer5 and its various projects is inevitable.\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Summer of Code 2020: Service Mesh Performance with Envoy Nighthawk","subtitle":"One of the greatest learning experiences yet.","date":"June 23rd, 2020","author":"Kush Trivedi","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/d1572/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/16e88/gsoc-wide.webp 125w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/f1e1b/gsoc-wide.webp 250w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/d1572/gsoc-wide.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":297}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/google-summer-of-code-2020-service-mesh-performance-with-envoy-nighthawk"}},{"id":"3f9938ec-1672-5660-a41a-09aba90884e4","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\nimport MeshMarkFormula from \"./meshmark-formula.png\";\nimport MeshMark from \"./meshmark.png\";\nimport Catalog from \"./catalog.png\";\nimport NighthawkSlide from \"./nighthawk-slide.png\";\nimport SMPSpec from \"./smp-spec.png\";\nimport Booth from \"./booth.png\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nHappy KubeCon week!

Their mission is fourfold:\n\n* **Clarity and Education:** Providing developers and operators with the knowledge and guidance they need to navigate cloud native networking.\n* **Collaboration and Integration:** Fostering collaboration between network projects and other CNCF initiatives for a unified ecosystem.\n* **Project Growth and Adoption:** Supporting the development and widespread adoption of promising network projects within the CNCF landscape.\n* **Neutral Stewardship:** Ensuring a fair and open environment for innovation in cloud native networking.\n\n## A Look Back: Tracking Progress Through KubeCon Events\n\nThe TAG Network and Service Mesh WG have a strong presence at KubeCon events, showcasing the evolution of cloud native networking:\n\n* **KubeCon NA 2019:** This marked the introduction of foundational projects like CNI (Container Network Interface), CoreDNS, Envoy, and Linkerd, laying the groundwork for future advancements.\n* **KubeCon Throughout 2020 & 2021:** The focus shifted towards service mesh adoption, with projects like BFE, Istio, SMI (Service Mesh Interface), and Meshery taking center stage, empowering developers to manage complex microservices architectures.\n* **Recent KubeCon Events:** The latest gatherings highlighted cutting-edge projects like GetNighthawk (performance analysis), KubeSlice (network slicing), and Connect (service mesh interoperability), demonstrating the continuous push for innovation.\n\n## Unveiling Service Mesh Patterns: Reusability Meets Best Practices\n\nThe Service Mesh WG champions the concept of service mesh patterns, a collection of reusable architectural building blocks designed for:\n\n* **End-User Focus:** Explained in clear language, these patterns are independent of specific service meshes, making them easy to understand and implement.\n* **Flexibility:** While core functionality remains consistent, users can leverage features specific to their chosen service mesh for even greater control.\n* **Reusability:** Patterns are designed to be easily copied, modified, and combined to create complex solutions tailored to your specific needs.\n* **Best Practices Integration:** Each pattern incorporates recommended practices for optimal network design, ensuring a solid foundation for your cloud native applications.\n\nExplore the extensive service mesh pattern library at [https://meshery.io/catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) to discover a treasure trove of reusable solutions for your cloud native network.\n\n<img src={Catalog} />\n<p/>\n\n## Nighthawk Takes Flight: Distributed Performance Analysis\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance initiative tackles the challenge of accurately measuring service mesh performance under load. Enter Nighthawk, a distributed performance analysis tool that empowers you to:\n\n* Generate realistic load scenarios that mimic real-world traffic patterns for a more accurate picture of your network's behavior.\n* Gain valuable insights into system behavior under pressure, allowing you to make informed decisions about configuration and optimization.\n* Compare performance across different service mesh deployments and configurations to identify the best fit for your specific needs.\n\n<img src={NighthawkSlide} />\n<p/>\n\n## Standardization Efforts: MeshMark and the SMP Spec\n\nThe CNCF TAG Network actively promotes standardization within the cloud native networking space. Two key initiatives are:\n\n #### **MeshMark:** \n <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/meshmark\">MeshMark</a> serves as a performance index gauging the significance and overhead within your cloud native ecosystem. By transforming performance metrics into actionable insights regarding the significance of individual networking functions within cloud native applications, MeshMark consolidates diverse overhead signals and crucial performance metrics into a straightforward index.\n<img src={MeshMark} />\n\n<img src={MeshMarkFormula} />\n\n<p />\n\n #### **SMP Spec (Service Mesh Performance Specification):**  \n This initiative establishes a vendor-neutral standard for measuring and reporting service mesh performance. This standardization paves the way for consistent performance comparisons and facilitates informed service mesh selection.\n<img src={SMPSpec} />\n<p/>\n\n\n## Join the Movement: Get Involved!\n\nThe CNCF TAG Network and Service Mesh WG are open communities that thrive on collaboration.
