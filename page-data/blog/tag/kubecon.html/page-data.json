We hope you are as excited as we are about all the fantastic things we will learn.\n\nZack and Nic are here in Paris representing TAG Network; today at 2:30. They have a lightning talk, and every afternoon, the TAG Network booth will be open for business!\n\n\nWe're excited to connect with you in person at KubeCon EU! You can find us at kiosk **PP19-A**, located in the **Solutions Showcase | Level 7.2 | Hall 7.2 | Project Pavilion**.\n\nAt the booth, we'll be showcasing demos of our two newest projects:\n\n* **Applying for Sandbox Status:** Learn how to easily apply for Sandbox status for your innovative cloud-native networking project.\n* **ConnectRPC:** Discover a revolutionary new approach to service mesh interoperability with ConnectRPC.\n* **KubeSlice:** Dive into the world of network slicing with KubeSlice, designed for optimal network resource utilization.\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", alignItems: \"center\" }}>\n<h2> Don't forget to catch our lightning talk today at 2:30! </h2>\n<img src={Booth} width=\"400\" />\n</div>\n\n<p />\n\nWhether you're interested in these projects, have questions about the TAG Network, or simply want to chat about cloud-native networking, we'd love to see you! Drop by our booth for a coffee and a conversation – we look forward to meeting you!\n\n\n## Building a Strong Foundation: The TAG Network Mission\n\nThe TAG Network, led by Lee Calcote (Layer5), Nic Jackson (HashiCorp), Zack Butcher (Tetrate), and technical lead Zhonghu Xu (Huawei), is dedicated to empowering the cloud native community. Their mission is fourfold:\n\n* **Clarity and Education:** Providing developers and operators with the knowledge and guidance they need to navigate cloud native networking.\n* **Collaboration and Integration:** Fostering collaboration between network projects and other CNCF initiatives for a unified ecosystem.\n* **Project Growth and Adoption:** Supporting the development and widespread adoption of promising network projects within the CNCF landscape.\n* **Neutral Stewardship:** Ensuring a fair and open environment for innovation in cloud native networking.\n\n## A Look Back: Tracking Progress Through KubeCon Events\n\nThe TAG Network and Service Mesh WG have a strong presence at KubeCon events, showcasing the evolution of cloud native networking:\n\n* **KubeCon NA 2019:** This marked the introduction of foundational projects like CNI (Container Network Interface), CoreDNS, Envoy, and Linkerd, laying the groundwork for future advancements.\n* **KubeCon Throughout 2020 & 2021:** The focus shifted towards service mesh adoption, with projects like BFE, Istio, SMI (Service Mesh Interface), and Meshery taking center stage, empowering developers to manage complex microservices architectures.\n* **Recent KubeCon Events:** The latest gatherings highlighted cutting-edge projects like GetNighthawk (performance analysis), KubeSlice (network slicing), and Connect (service mesh interoperability), demonstrating the continuous push for innovation.\n\n## Unveiling Service Mesh Patterns: Reusability Meets Best Practices\n\nThe Service Mesh WG champions the concept of service mesh patterns, a collection of reusable architectural building blocks designed for:\n\n* **End-User Focus:** Explained in clear language, these patterns are independent of specific service meshes, making them easy to understand and implement.\n* **Flexibility:** While core functionality remains consistent, users can leverage features specific to their chosen service mesh for even greater control.\n* **Reusability:** Patterns are designed to be easily copied, modified, and combined to create complex solutions tailored to your specific needs.\n* **Best Practices Integration:** Each pattern incorporates recommended practices for optimal network design, ensuring a solid foundation for your cloud native applications.\n\nExplore the extensive service mesh pattern library at [https://meshery.io/catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) to discover a treasure trove of reusable solutions for your cloud native network.\n\n<img src={Catalog} />\n<p/>\n\n## Nighthawk Takes Flight: Distributed Performance Analysis\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance initiative tackles the challenge of accurately measuring service mesh performance under load. Enter Nighthawk, a distributed performance analysis tool that empowers you to:\n\n* Generate realistic load scenarios that mimic real-world traffic patterns for a more accurate picture of your network's behavior.\n* Gain valuable insights into system behavior under pressure, allowing you to make informed decisions about configuration and optimization.\n* Compare performance across different service mesh deployments and configurations to identify the best fit for your specific needs.\n\n<img src={NighthawkSlide} />\n<p/>\n\n## Standardization Efforts: MeshMark and the SMP Spec\n\nThe CNCF TAG Network actively promotes standardization within the cloud native networking space. Two key initiatives are:\n\n #### **MeshMark:** \n <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/meshmark\">MeshMark</a> serves as a performance index gauging the significance and overhead within your cloud native ecosystem. By transforming performance metrics into actionable insights regarding the significance of individual networking functions within cloud native applications, MeshMark consolidates diverse overhead signals and crucial performance metrics into a straightforward index.\n<img src={MeshMark} />\n\n<img src={MeshMarkFormula} />\n\n<p />\n\n #### **SMP Spec (Service Mesh Performance Specification):**  \n This initiative establishes a vendor-neutral standard for measuring and reporting service mesh performance. This standardization paves the way for consistent performance comparisons and facilitates informed service mesh selection.\n<img src={SMPSpec} />\n<p/>\n\n\n## Join the Movement: Get Involved!\n\nThe CNCF TAG Network and Service Mesh WG are open communities that thrive on collaboration. Here's how you can contribute:\n\n* Attend their bi-weekly meetings on the 1st and 3rd Thursdays of each month at 11 AM Pacific Time.\n* Stay informed by reading meeting minutes on the CNCF website.\n* Connect with the community on the #tag-network Slack channel and share your experiences and ideas.\n* Subscribe to the cncf-sig-network-servicemesh-wg mailing list for updates and announcements.\n\nBy actively participating in these initiatives, you can play a vital role in shaping the future of resilient and intelligent cloud native networks\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Layer5 at KubeCon EU 2024","subtitle":"Deep Dive into Cloud Native Networking with CNCF TAG Network & Service Mesh WG","date":"March 20th,

Security Slam started at the beginning of October and will end at the conference. The program offers a chance to not only strengthen the security of your project but also to contribute $50,000 to the diversity scholarship fund. Sonatype and CNCF are working together as part of a Google-sponsored initiative to assess how well projects adhere to CNCF's security criteria. Each project that achieves full security will get a $2,500 donation from Google for the CNCF's Diversity Scholarship Fund.\n<h4>Kid’s Day</h4>\n  Kid's Day will be held on October 23, the day before the main event begins! In two fantastic STEAM workshops, this is meant to provide young creatives in the Detroit area the chance to unleash their thoughts. Children are not required to register for KubeCon + CloudNativeCon in order to take part in Kid's Day. You can <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfVosJ43gSGC_d2Uenxe4vjdihHENwfSL5-acLZljxKgvyKyg/viewform\">pre-register</a>.\n<h4>Contribfest</h4>\n  At this year's conferences, we have <a href=\"https://kccncna2022.sched.com/overview/type/ContribFest?iframe=no\">Contribfest</a>, which will offer a forum for tracking technical debt, eliminating bugs, and resolving open issues and requests in CNCF projects. Project contributors and maintainers come together during Contribfest in a common area to work on outstanding issues of various sizes. Projects like Knative Eventing, KubeVirt, Ago, Flux, and Prometheus are ready for Contribfest cleaning.\n<h4>Resumé Writing Workshop</h4>\n  Attendees are encouraged to join this unique DEI event, which will feature a resume writing class, mingling, networking, and refreshments. The event will take place on October 25 from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and is sponsored by Visit Detroit.
