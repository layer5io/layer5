This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery. However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.\", mdx(\"p\", null, \"Therefore, it's important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment.
