Aabid is a\n    maintainer of <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery UI</Link>.\n    In this interview, we get to know Aabid a little better and learn about his\n    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Aabid, thank you for taking the time to join me today. While many people, both within and beyond the Layer5 community, have witnessed the impact of your contributions, they may not know the story behind who you are and how you became a maintainer. Could you share your journey with us? How did you discover the Layer5 community, and what inspired you to stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      My journey with Layer5 began about two years ago, during a transitional phase in my career as I was moving away from regular consulting work and exploring open source more seriously. Meshery immediately caught my eye—it had a wealth of open issues that aligned well with my skillset at the time. What truly sealed the deal, though, was the community. Everyone was incredibly welcoming and supportive, especially in the areas where I had less experience. That combination of technical opportunity and community warmth made it easy to stick around and get involved deeply.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      You’re a <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery UI</Link> maintainer. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      Frontend engineering has always been a space that excites me. While some people like to strictly divide frontend and backend work, I view engineering as the art of abstraction—building clients that interface with systems behind the scenes. I approach UI development with the same principles I’d apply anywhere else in engineering: scalability, robustness, and maintainability. Sure, JavaScript has its quirks (like any language), but that’s just part of the fun. Being a UI maintainer gives me the chance to ensure that the user-facing side of Meshery reflects solid engineering values.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      Yes, I’ve contributed to several open source projects, though none as deeply or meaningfully as I have with Layer5. This community holds a special place in my heart. It gave me a platform to grow, to sharpen my skills, and—importantly—to have my work recognized and valued. The level of engagement and collaboration here is unlike anything I’ve experienced elsewhere.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n     There are more projects here than I can count on my fingers! I’ve been actively contributing to Meshery, Meshkit, Meshery Extensions, and Sistent, among others. Each project brings unique challenges and learning opportunities, and I enjoy bouncing between them based on where help is most needed.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery UI demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      One of the coolest demos I’ve seen—and personally enjoyed showcasing—is Meshery’s capability to intelligently infer and visualize relationships between various infrastructure components. There’s always a moment of awe when users see connections and dependencies automatically materialize on the screen—it feels like magic, and it’s an incredibly powerful way to understand your system’s topology.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n  What is your favorite feature or aspect of UI in this project, and why?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      My favorite aspect of the project has been the UI—especially the collaborative and visual design features we’ve built into it. I’ve always admired tools like Google Docs and Figma for how they enable real-time collaboration and intuitive design workflows. Being part of a project that offers similar capabilities for infrastructure management is an opportunity I wouldn’t trade for anything.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      One principle I try to follow—and would recommend to others—is to not fear making mistakes or admitting when you don’t know something. Acknowledging knowledge gaps is actually a strength—it helps you grow faster. After all, you can’t fix what you don’t realize is broken. Be curious, be humble, and you’ll find your footing.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Where do you see opportunities for contributors to actively engage and contribute to UI within the Meshery and Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n    Meshery is rapidly evolving—it’s currently the 9th fastest-growing project under the CNCF umbrella. There are countless ways to get involved. Start by joining the community and introducing yourself along with your skills and interests. Community managers are great at helping contributors find the right fit.\n  At the moment, areas like Meshery’s CLI, Meshery Server, and even digital marketing are actively seeking contributions. While most of Layer5’s 100+ repositories are open, two—Kanvas and Cloud—are currently closed-source but are being actively developed by community contributors. These projects are highly collaborative, with 15+ active contributors meeting daily and nearly 100 total contributors to date.\n  The team working on these projects meets every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday at 9:00 AM Central / 7:30 PM IST via meet.layer5.io/team. Anyone with interest, a collaborative spirit, and consistent participation is warmly welcomed—even into the closed-source efforts.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Let's get to know you a bit better with some quick questions:  What's the emoji you use most often? Do you prefer movies or books? Would you consider yourself a morning person or a night owl? Over the past year, what's a project or accomplishment you're particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>😀\n      Looking at my emoji history, 🙏 and 😀 are definitely the most used—and honestly, that says a lot about this community. It’s warm, collaborative, and full of gratitude.\n    As for me, I’d say I lean toward being a night owl, and while I do enjoy both books and movies, it depends on the mood. One project I’m particularly proud of is the real-time collaboration functionality we’ve added to the UI—bringing ideas like those in Figma or Docs to infrastructure tooling has been incredibly satisfying.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Meshery UI contributors or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      My advice is simple: pick an area that genuinely interests you—there are plenty to choose from here. You don’t need to know everything right away. Start with small, manageable issues and use them as a learning opportunity. Over time, your understanding will deepen, and so will your impact. Consistency and curiosity go a long way.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      In other words, staying curious and consistently contributing, even in small ways at first, can build the foundation for becoming a strong Meshery UI contributor or even a maintainer over time.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n  Exactly, Himani. It’s all about building momentum. Every small contribution—whether it’s fixing a bug, improving docs, or reviewing a PR—adds up and helps you grow into the role. What matters most is the willingness to learn, adapt, and collaborate with others in the community. That’s the real pathway to becoming a strong contributor and eventually a maintainer.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Aabid.

Many people inside and outside of the\n    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not\n    know the backstory as to who Ian is and how you arrived at your maintainer\n    role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What inspired you\n    to stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      My journey into Layer5 began with a desire to contribute to an open source project during Hacktoberfest 2024.  I was looking for a welcoming community that was working on meaningful problems - somewhere I could operate at the intersection of what I already knew and where I wanted to grow. That's when I found Meshery and Layer5. After joining a newcomers meeting, I immediately felt it was the right fit as a place I could explore deeper cloud native topics, a new programming language like golang and contribute to the UI. What inspired me to stay was the emphasis on collaboration and developer growth. Before I knew it, I was actively contributing to Meshery and eventually invited to become a maintainer.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery UI</Link> maintainer. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      After being a contributor for some time, I looked to the maintainers as leaders that were champions of culture to guide and lift others up to contribute and grow their technical skills and leadership. I hope to be able to continue with this emphasis of helping others grow and develop.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      I have not contributed to any other open source projects.

We are currently trying to mature our testing efforts around Meshery UI client with playwright. This space is a great space to learn the product and improve the user flows while increasing test coverage.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Let's get to know you a bit better with some quick questions:  What's the emoji you use most often?

I prefer books - the more technical the better 😀. I'm a morning person with a cup of coffee.\n    Over the past year, I feel most accomplished by trying to give back as much as I've gained. This includes efforts through code contributions, mentoring, or sharing what I've learned along the way. Being part of this community has shown me the value of collaboration, and I've made it a point to support new contributors, answer questions, and help others contribute. It's incredibly rewarding to see someone you helped gain confidence and start making meaningful contributions of their own.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      Try to build a habit of learning, contributing and helping others.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Ian.

\"}\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/aisuko-li\">Aisuko Li</Link>. Aisuko is a\n    maintainer of the{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\"> Meshery Adapters</Link>{\" \"}\n    project. In this interview, we get to know Aisuko a little better and learn\n    about his journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5\n    community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Aisuko, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of\n    the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may\n    not know the backstory as to who Aisuko is and how you arrived at your\n    maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What\n    made you stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      Thanks for having me here. Actually, Aisuko is my code name. My real name is Bowen Li. I love both of \n    I used to work for RancherLabs for a while, and I worked to maintain the official Helm (a third-party management tool for Kubernetes manifests) charts repo. These experiences helped me contribute to creating and maintaining Meshery Helm charts.\n    <br />\n    I like open source software, and I love contributing to the community.\n    The more you contribute, the more permission you get to help the\n    community grow and improve.\n    <br />\n    The Layer5 community is a true open source community. Everyone here can find\n    a comfortable role. I have been here since 2019 (a long time ago). I’ve seen\n    new members join and some leave. It's great to see people work together without\n    any other conditions. This is one of the ways I have fun.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      You’ve been consistently contributing to a large number of Layer5 projects\n    (Meshery adapters, mesheryctl, SMI, SMP). Layer5 has a large collection of\n    active projects. Which one are you currently focusing on? <i>Psst.</i> Also,\n    which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      Actually, the Meshery project in 2021-2022 has changed a lot. More skilled and\n    talented contributors joined the community. They are so professional and\n    active, and their hard work has made Meshery more powerful than before. For\n    instance, projects like `meshkit` and `meshsync` have grown significantly.\n    It’s great to have such a strong team working together.\n    <br />\n    Right now, I am primarily focusing on the `meshery-operator` project and\n    `meshery-linkerd`, along with fixing bugs across all the projects. I always\n    aim to make all the projects more controllable and maintain high code quality.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source projects? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I was active in the Rancher community and the Helm charts project, where I owned\n    three charts. I’m also still a maintainer of the GNU Hurd. Recently, I’ve been\n    working on contributions to Kubernetes community projects as well.\n    <br />\n    Compared to the Layer5 community, the Kubernetes community is much larger. \n    Many members are not very active, so it can be difficult to get feedback \n    on PRs and issues from inactive members.\n    <br />\n    The GNU Hurd project is unique, so there’s no need to compare it with others.\n    In the Layer5 community, we have a warm welcome for new contributors, and most\n    projects have active reviewers who provide feedback quickly.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n  Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically, though?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I have worked with many middle- and small-sized companies that wanted to migrate\n    to the cloud. It’s easy to move to Kubernetes, but it’s hard to ensure everything\n    runs smoothly. You have limited visibility into what’s happening in the cluster,\n    and service mesh solves that problem by showing real-time traffic.\n    <br />\n    Service mesh provides direct insights into traffic flows, which is its most useful feature.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Haha. Leading on from that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope\n    to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I once talked to Lee, the founder of Layer5. Due to time zone differences, we don’t\n    get many chances to discuss things directly. But I believe we don’t need to create\n    a new service mesh.\n    <br />\n    What we should do is provide third-party performance tools for existing service\n    mesh projects. We should give the choice back to the users, letting them pick the\n    service mesh that best suits their needs.\n    <br />\n    We should contribute to SMI and CNCF projects, helping to define performance standards\n    for the cloud-native industry. That’s why I’m keen on joining these communities.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Interesting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I believe we can offer a CNCF-standard performance tool for all service mesh\n    applications. We can collaborate with service mesh maintainers to define these\n    standards, which would be beneficial for end-users. It’s similar to what we did\n    with SMI.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n  What are today's challenges when working with service meshes?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      Even though service mesh has many features, it's still not always stable in production.\n    I remember that even Istio (v1.1x) couldn’t be upgraded to newer versions easily.\n    <br />\n    Additionally, we don’t often get test results from real production environments.\n    Right now, the focus is on multi-cluster service mesh capabilities, which brings\n    new challenges.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I’ve worked with service mesh applications like Linkerd2, Istio, and OSM in development environments. OSM is my preference because it’s modular and has a simpler architecture compared to others.\n    <br />\n    From my experience, I believe that not all environments need all the features of a service mesh. Some middle or small companies may only need visibility into traffic flows without complex features like mTLS.\n    <br />\n    So, we should focus on simple architecture and features. For example, integrating traffic visualization with Ingress, so users don’t need to create new custom resources to track traffic.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Ah, while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up.\n    Cloud Native and especially the field of service meshes is evolving\n    exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging.\n    Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      People are always interested in new technology, but we are limited by time. I believe\n    that continuing to contribute to the CNCF open source community is the best way\n    to stay updated.\n    <br />\n    Articles and news may include the author’s personal opinions, and we don't always know\n    if they have strong relationships with the community. We should maintain critical thinking\n    and focus on solving real-world problems. The best way to learn is through hands-on experience.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      It’s an honor to be a maintainer of the Meshery community. The membership\n    is a reward for contributing to the community. Being a maintainer has made me\n    more enthusiastic about contributing to open source projects. It has also given\n    me confidence to contribute to other projects.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      The Layer5 and Meshery communities are always welcoming to everyone.\n    New features are great, but there’s more to contributing than just code.\n    For example, writing unit tests and code comments is just as important as\n    adding new features.\n    <br />\n    One of our goals is to provide an opportunity for everyone who wants to contribute\n    to open source projects, so we need to maintain a high level of code quality.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Aisuko. Be like Aisuko.

series, we have{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/hussaina-begum\">Hussaina Begum</Link>, Staff Engineer at VMware. Hussaina\n    is a maintainer of{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery CLI</Link>. In\n    this interview, we get to know Hussaina a little better and learn about her\n    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Hussaina, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of\n    the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may\n    not know the backstory as to who Hussaina is and how you arrived at your\n    maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What\n    made you stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      I wanted to contribute to open source for a long time and finally made up\n    my mind to get into the world of open source during Hacktoberfest 2020.\n    Meshery was one of the projects I contributed to and it had a well defined\n    structure and meetings for everyone - Newcomers call, Developers call,\n    Websites (Frontend development) call, CI/CD call and Community call, etc.\n    Also, the MeshMate program where the existing Meshery maintainers help the\n    newest members to get started. Meshery project aligned with my networking\n    background and my goal towards backend development using golang. Last but\n    not the least, lighthearted jokes from Lee during the development call.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a Meshery Maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does\n    being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Lots of learning. Though I started out small in Meshery with a\n    documentation PR, Meshery community had so much knowledge to share. With\n    their support, I could start on `mesheryctl` UX improvements. I have seen many bright engineers implementing great features in Meshery. I draw inspiration from them and try to pay it forward by helping new members of the community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n    <i>Psst.</i> Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      I have contributed to mesheryctl, meshkit and meshery.io projects so far,\n    It's hard to pick one.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      The <a href=\"https://playground.meshery.io\">Meshery Playground</a> is an awesome system and a something of a hidden gem in cloud native ecosystem. I also remember the `mesheryctl perf` CLI demo I have done on the Meshery office hours from one of the Kubecon events and am proud of this. Kudos to all the contributors of `mesheryctl` command development and refactors.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What do you anticipate will be Meshery’s biggest announcement this year?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n  Meshery project moving to Incubating status! 🙂\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your favorite Meshery CLI command?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n  mesheryctl system start\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Use Slack effectively and leverage discuss forum, talk to MeshMates and\n    maintainers, they are all ears to the issues you face while starting out.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery\n    and the Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Work on the long pending `system config` CLI improvements and contribute to\n    other Meshery projects.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Interesting. Do expand on that: What do you think Meshery could offer in\n    addition to what it already does?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n  Labs designed in a way that they work with local resources.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person\n    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re\n    particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      eyes emoji. My preference is a book compared to a movie. I am a Night Owl\n    w.r.t. work, however, I use my early mornings for my fitness goals. I have\n    not been active lately, however removing dependency on CLIs in `mesheryctl\n    system config` would be something I would consider a good milestone item for\n    me.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the\n    developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      I like listening to kubernetes podcasts and I follow the internal slack\n    channels for upstream activities at VMware. Also, attending the local KCD\n    events helped me understand the latest developments across various k8s\n    projects. Being a program committee member has given me good understanding\n    of developments across a specific technology area, let it be security and\n    identity area or the world of service meshes.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Show up and attend the meetings which align with your expertise and areas\n    you would like to learn or contribute to. Make use of the Meshmates and\n    Meshery slack and discuss forums are pretty active and everyone is eager to\n    help.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Hussaina. Be like Hussaina. Join the{\" \"}\n    <a href=\"https://slack.layer5.io\">Layer5 Slack</a> and say “hi\".\n</div>\n\n</MeetTheMaintainer>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Maintainer: Hussaina

series, we have{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/aadhitya-amarendiran\">Aadhitya Amarendiran</Link>. Aadhitya\n    is a maintainer of the{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\"> Meshery CLI</Link> project. In\n    this interview, we get to know Aadhitya a little better and learn about his\n    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Aadhitya, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Aadhitya is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      It was around the year 2020 when I was a sophomore and explored many things in the field of open source. I got to know about Meshery via the LFX program and tried applying for it, though I was a newcomer at that time. Later, I learned more about Layer5, started attending the community call, and met the community. The community members helped me a lot wherever I got stuck as a newcomer, which made me learn new things and involve myself in the project, which later helped me grow. Oh, of course, great learning sessions from Lee during development and community calls.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a Meshery Maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does\n    being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Three things come into my mind: Learning lots of new things, Challenging yourself to your limits and being a helpful navigator for contributors. During my time as a newcomer, I started out with a simple readme fix PR in the Meshery project, which I thought would cause less impact. But the maintainers accepted my PR though it’s a very small one. That instilled a feeling in me that I should give back to the community by helping newcomers and contributors whenever they are stuck in work.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Not a lot, but I worked on quite a few open source projects. Layer5 is one of the best places to start if you are new to open source. By being involved in the community, you will feel and understand the spirit of open source.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      I currently work on Meshery, as it piqued my interest during my initial days. I also work on the Meshery-SMP GitHub action project as well.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n     I’ve seen a lot of demos but the coolest one for me is the Meshery Docker extension where you can start and use Meshery right from DockerHub!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What is your favorite Meshery CLI Command?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n  Oof! That’s a tricky one. But my favorite one is definitely <code>mesheryctl perf</code>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      If you’re starting out with Meshery, make sure to use the Meshery Playground if you want to get hands-on for the first time without the need to deploy Meshery in your system. After you get the basics right, install Meshery and log in to your deployed instance. You’ll see that your designs, performance test results and configurations remain intact in your instance as if they are present exactly the same in the Playground. There’s no need to start from scratch. Just continue where you left off!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Where do you see opportunities for contributors to get involved within Meshery and Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n  Considering the fact that Meshery is now a part of CNCF (especially the fact that we are aiming for the Incubation status as well!), I feel that Meshery has a wide range of scope for contributors to be involved in. Whether you’re an expert or a newbie, Meshery has lots of subdomains to contribute. Documentation, Frontend, Backend, Adapters… the list goes on.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person\n    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re\n    particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n     Most used emoji: 😎. I’m a morning person usually and sleep early, but sometimes I’m a night owl when it comes to intense work. I’d prefer movies compared to books as for some they clearly adapt from books. I’ve worked on refactoring the <code>mesheryctl pattern</code> command to <code>mesheryctl design</code> without losing the core features present. This took me a bit of time as I had to balance my current work as well which caused a bit of inactivity. But I managed to complete it, and I’m proud of doing such great work!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Make your presence stand out from the crowd even if you are a beginner, and learn as much as you can. Seek MeshMates and maintainers if you get stuck in something. Ask questions during meets or in Slack, and get feedback on your PRs, doesn’t matter if it’s big or small. Incorporate feedback and improvise. Remember, communication is the key, and be active!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      In other words, whether your contribution is big or small, it sounds like aiming for high-quality contributions that add value to the projects is key.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Yes, you got it right! Even the smallest contribution which creates a good impact in a project becomes a great factor in Open source. All that matters is perseverance, challenging yourself to limits and learning. Do these things right and you’ll find yourself growing in the community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Aadhitya. Be like Aadhitya. Join the{\" \"}\n    <a href=\"https://slack.layer5.io\">Layer5 Slack</a> and say “hi\".\n</div>\n\n</MeetTheMaintainer>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Maintainer: Aadhitya

from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nEarly last month, I got the news that I had been accepted as a UI Visual Design Intern at Layer5. Five months ago, I was a new contributor with zero knowledge of cloud native technologies roaming through their Github looking to make my first contribution. In this article, I’ll share my journey contributing to Layer5 as a designer. I’ll also share insights I hope new contributors find useful as they navigate their open source journey.\n\n### Discovery\nI first learned about Layer5 through the LFX Mentorship. I stumbled upon a tweet by [Anita Ihuman](/community/members/anita-ihuman) announcing that [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery) was accepting mentees for a design-related project. I had always been looking to make design contributions to open source projects but it was hard finding one. So, this was a great opportunity for me.\n\n### My First Contribution\nInterestingly, my first contribution to Layer5 had nothing to do with design. It was a writing task. They needed a blog that highlighted [the importance of GitHub stars](https://layer5.io/blog/community/on-the-importance-of-github-stars) to a project. The purpose of the blog was to boost the project’s visibility by encouraging more people to [give Meshery a star](https://github.com/meshery/meshery) on GitHub. Since I had some experience writing, I volunteered to write the blog. It was a bit more tasking than I had anticipated but with the help of the community, I was able to work through it.\n \n### Making Design Contributions\nI noticed there were a bunch of open issues to design badges for users and contributors. I requested to work on one of the badges and got assigned. I didn’t initially have edit access to the community Figma file so I struggled to get assets like the logo and font to create the design. I eventually found them in the local branch of Layer5 that I had cloned earlier on my PC. Turned out that all the resources I needed to complete that task were available to me; I just needed to know where to look.\n\nThat was my first design contribution. Since then I’ve designed more badges and contributed in many other ways besides design. For instance, I worked on documentation and helped with marketing and community management.\n\n### How I've Benefited\nHere’s a non-exhaustive summary of how contributing to Layer5 has benefited me:\n1. **Autonomy** - I’ve learned to own my process and see tasks from start to finish. When I volunteered to write that first blog, I thought I’d do just the writing part and someone else would get it up on the website. I didn’t realize that I would have to clone a repository, learn to use Git CMD, make commits, learn Markdown, and raise a pull request. These were all foreign to me and I was doing them for the first time. It was a great learning opportunity and I’m grateful for it.\n1. **Presentation** - We hold weekly meetings where contributors share what they’re working on and receive feedback. Presenting at these meetings has taught me to not just show my work, but to talk about it. I’m not a great orator so this was challenging for me at first but I’ve noticed that I’m getting more confident with each presentation I make. I’m gradually learning how to clearly articulate my thought process and have a valid justification for any route I choose to take to complete a task.\n1. **Design** - Making design contributions has helped improve the quality of my work. Sometimes, I’d nail a design on my first try. Other times, I may have to iterate several times before I get it right. The important thing is that I end up producing high-quality work. I’ve also learned to detach myself from my work, be objective, and gracefully accept constructive criticism.\n1. **Collaboration** - For the first time, I get to work together with developers and other designers. Thanks to Layer5.  I’m also learning to use communication and collaboration tools like Slack, GitHub, and ClickUp.\n\n### How You Can Contribute to Layer5\nMy experience clearly shows that you don’t necessarily need to know anything about coding or cloud native technologies to contribute to Layer5 projects. Are you a designer, technical writer, community manager, or digital marketer? There are several ways to contribute. You can\n- Work on improving the [documentation](https://docs.layer5.io),\n- Design new website pages or improve the UX of existing ones,\n- Warmly welcome newcomers to the community and offer support,\n- Give constructive feedback during the weekly meetings,\n- Talk about Layer5 and invite your friends to use and [star Meshery](https://github.com/meshery),\n- Write articles for our blog.\n\nThe list is endless. My advice is that you do not box yourself. Don’t feel that because you’re a designer, your contributions will be strictly design-related. If you want to make impactful contributions, pay attention to the needs of the community/project and help where you can.\n\nFor more guidance on contributing to Layer5, check out our [newcomer’s guide](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers).\n\n\n\\-- <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/victoria-nduka\">Victoria Nduka</Link>\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Contributing to Layer5: A Designer’s Journey","subtitle":"Insights from a visual design intern at Layer5","date":"January 7th, 2024","author":"Victoria Nduka","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/header-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAACgAAQUxQSBYAAAABF3D//4iIgkAQwsk8s9qBiP5nDsUAVlA4IHoAAADwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFWo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdAB0/ee7rnQZi638AAMstRxrtKSi7+7S8JymTGvCtcLKNLKKdplSAdauCkhgY2PJvuIh+bfYNM4XGU5sRiiIgEvM/Bf+BElPT/5qN9OgU8CEbdEgkn6py6rYfVa4AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/a66aa/header-image.webp 750w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/65dd5/header-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5632}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/header-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAACgAAQUxQSBYAAAABF3D//4iIgkAQwsk8s9qBiP5nDsUAVlA4IHoAAADwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFWo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdAB0/ee7rnQZi638AAMstRxrtKSi7+7S8JymTGvCtcLKNLKKdplSAdauCkhgY2PJvuIh+bfYNM4XGU5sRiiIgEvM/Bf+BElPT/5qN9OgU8CEbdEgkn6py6rYfVa4AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/6e8bd/header-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/46142/header-image.webp 125w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/81c3e/header-image.webp 250w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/6e8bd/header-image.webp 500w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/bf95e/header-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":282}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/contributing-to-layer5-a-designers-journey"}},{"id":"bacbe561-602a-576b-a9ad-3e6a82e85954","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport mesheryLogo from \"../../../../assets/images/meshery/icon-only/meshery-logo-light.svg\";\nimport hacktoberfestEvent from \"./layer5-event-hacktoberfest2023.png\";\nimport cloudNativeHacktoberfest from \"./hacktoberfest-2023-with-layer5.png\";\nimport hacktoberfestBadge from \"./hacktoberfest-contributor.png\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nAs the leaves begin to turn and the air grows crisp, it can only mean one thing: [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) is here! This annual celebration of open source, hosted by DigitalOcean, invites contributors from all over the world to participate in a month-long extravaganza of code contributions.\n\nWhile the allure of limited-edition swag may be enticing, it's essential to approach Hacktoberfest with a mindset focused on quality, respect for maintainers, and a commitment to long-term community engagement.\n\nLayer5 has a long history of participating in Hacktoberfest. 2023 is no different. Our annual [Hacktoberfest kickoff and prep event](/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects) (be sure to join) is tomorrow.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Purposeful Participation: Beyond Swag Chasing and Profile Building\n\nBefore you embark on your Hacktoberfest journey, take a moment to reflect on your motivation. Are you here solely for the swag, just for the green boxes in your GitHub profile, or do you genuinely want to make a meaningful contribution to a project, learn, grow, and make new friends in the process?\n\nEmbrace the opportunity to forge lasting connections and dive deeper into topics that resonate with you.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Quality Over Quantity: Making a Lasting Impact\n\nWhile a flurry of pull requests may be impressive, maintainers value contributions that add genuine value.\n\nThink beyond code and consider how your unique skills—whether in design, organization, or other areas—can enrich the project. Open source thrives on meaningful contributions, so aim to make a tangible difference rather than settling for mediocrity.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  quote=\"When you are clear about what motivates you, each contribution you make will help you achieve your goals, because you will be working on projects that are aligned with your values.\"\n  person=\"Lee Calcote\"\n/>\n\n---\n\n### 3. Guidelines Aren't Optional: Respecting the Playbook\n\nThat CONTRIBUTING.md file? It's not there for decoration. Treat it as your playbook, providing guidance for equitable collaboration.\n\nIgnoring these guidelines is akin to rearranging someone's furniture without permission. Established protocols are crucial, especially in projects with numerous contributors.\n\nAs an example, there is a full set of contributing docs written for Meshery — one for each component:\n\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-gitflow\">Contributing to Meshery using Git</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/meshery-windows\">Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release\">Contributing to Meshery Build and Release (CI)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cypress\">End-to-End Tests using Cypress</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-adapters\">Meshery Adapters</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docker-extension\">Docker Extension</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-server\">Meshery Server</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-models\">Meshery Models</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-error\">MeshKit Compatible Errors</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui\">Meshery UI</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docs\">Docs</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli\">CLI</a>\n\n---\n\n### 4. Upholding a Safe Environment: The Code of Conduct\n\nRespect, collaboration, and kindness are the bedrock of open source. The Code of Conduct is non-negotiable, ensuring a secure and inclusive space for all contributors.\n\nThe [Layer5 Community Handbook](/community/handbook) offers an excellent reference for community norms and practices.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Engaging Beyond Code: Fostering Holistic Development\n\nDon’t confine yourself to a GitHub profile. Engage in meaningful discussions, participate in webinars, and [open discussions](https://discuss.layer5.io).\n\nOpen source offers a wealth of opportunities for comprehensive growth.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Compassion Over Code: Recognizing Maintainer Burnout\n\n<Link to=\"/community/handbook/repository-overview\">Maintainers</Link> are the unsung heroes of the open-source world, often overwhelmed by the Hacktoberfest influx.\n\nStart with issues tagged **good first issue** or **help wanted**.\n\n---\n\n### 7. The Virtue of Patience: Embracing the Long Game\n\nOpen source is a marathon, not a sprint. Feedback may take time. Patience is essential.\n\n---\n\n### 8.

Maybe someone has even asked you to star their repository. If you've ever wondered how much of an impact your star could make on their project, you're in the right place. Let's explore what GitHub Stars are and explore the significant role they play in boosting a project.\n\n### What are GitHub Stars?\n\nGitHub stars are like virtual thumbs-up or bookmarks that you can give to projects you like on the GitHub platform. They're a way to show that you find a project interesting, useful, or valuable. When you star a project, when you star a project, it's represented at the [stargazers](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/stargazers) section of the repository.\n\nStars are one of the key metrics that GitHub uses to track and identify trending projects on its platform. When a repository gains a significant number of stars within a relatively short period, it can be an indicator that the project is gaining popularity, and consequently, qualifies as a \"trending project\". \n\nHere's how GitHub uses stars to track trending projects:\n\n1. **Star Activity** -\nGitHub monitors the rate at which repositories are being starred. Projects that receive a sudden surge of stars are likely to catch the attention of GitHub's algorithms.\n1. **Time Interval** -\nGitHub takes into account the time frame within which stars are accumulated. Projects that gain stars rapidly in a short span of time are considered for trending status.\n1. **Relative Comparison** -\nTrending repositories are often determined based on a comparison with their usual star activity. If a repository's star activity significantly exceeds its typical rate, it might be flagged as trending.\n1. **Consistency** -\nWhile rapid stars are important, consistent activity also matters. Projects that sustain their increased star activity over time are more likely to be recognized as trending.\n\nOnce a repository meets these criteria, it might be highlighted on GitHub's Trending page or other curated sections of the platform. This visibility can attract even more attention and stars, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the project's popularity.\n\n### Effect of Stars on a Project\nStarring a project on GitHub does not directly impact the project’s functionality, but it can have several positive effects which include:\n\n- **Visibility** -\nStarring a project increases its visibility. Projects with more stars tend to appear higher in search results, making it easier for others to discover and contribute to the project\n- **Community Engagement** -\nA higher number of stars can attract more contributors, users, and potential collaborators. It indicates that the project has generated interest and resonates with others.\n- **Motivation** - \nFor project maintainers and contributors, seeing their project receive stars can be motivating. It shows that their work is appreciated and valued by the community.\n- **Recognition** - Starring a project is a way for users to acknowledge and recognize the effort put into it. It’s a form of social validation.\n- **Contributor Potential** - Potential contributors might use the number of stars a project has as a signal of the project’s importance and popularity. A well-started project might attract developers looking for projects to contribute to.\n- **Feedback and Support** - Starring can also serve as a lightweight way for users to express their support for the project or to keep track of projects they find interesting even if they don’t actively contribute.\n\nOverall, starring a project helps create a positive cycle where visibility leads to engagement, engagement leads to contributions, and contributions lead to a stronger project.\n\n### How to Star a Repository\nStarring a repository is a simple two-step process.\n- **Step 1:** On [GitHub](https://github.com/meshery/meshery), navigate to the main page of the repository.\n- **Step 2:** At the top-right corner of the page, click Star.\n\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n    <img src={Before}/>\n    <figcaption>\n    Before adding a star\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n <br/>\n<p style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}> This is what a project will look like after you have starred it:</p>\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n    <img src={After}/>\n    <figcaption>\n    After adding a star\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n<br/>\n\n## Five Needs Your Stars\n\nNow that you understand how much impact stars can make, take a moment to help [Five on his Cloud Native journey](https://layer5.io/five/vol1/mascot-five-adventure-github-stars.pdf). Five is our intergalactic Cloud Native Hero on a journey to the Meshery planet. Five’s rocketship runs on stars and he needs all the stars he can get. The community is doing its best to provide fuel, but that's not enough. Our friend Five needs more stars to get him through this journey. \n\nYou can help Five by giving a star to the [Meshery](https://github.com/meshery/meshery)!  \n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery\">\n    <figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n        <img src={Five}/>\n            <figcaption style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n            🌟 Star the Meshery repository 🌟\n            <br/>\n        </figcaption>\n    </figure> \n</a>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"On the Importance of GitHub Stars","subtitle":"Why GitHub Stars matter to open source projects, their contributors, and their users","date":"August 24th, 2023","author":"Victoria Nduka","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/hero-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4IKoAAAAQBACdASoUABQAPtFgqE+oJSOiKAgBABoJZAC7AYx2d6u88efTZmvEAAD+8fVdsHQlXq3jVZiT4HlTSYHC76Bkhl3N9mWOIZvnVoQgUxCJxyd6S48+v2TH1nYudT1ZX2ng9J9RF5meZA/KyjGIlUMDTJgTVDPG9o6TEzPDcRVfPKil4Rz1qJidMSWQejRUqtf4mG/S+bvdff9/edl6lOp9WeN3lpstED0OAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/d6f60/hero-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/4f03f/hero-image.webp 750w,\n/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/d6f60/hero-image.webp 960w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/hero-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4IKoAAAAQBACdASoUABQAPtFgqE+oJSOiKAgBABoJZAC7AYx2d6u88efTZmvEAAD+8fVdsHQlXq3jVZiT4HlTSYHC76Bkhl3N9mWOIZvnVoQgUxCJxyd6S48+v2TH1nYudT1ZX2ng9J9RF5meZA/KyjGIlUMDTJgTVDPG9o6TEzPDcRVfPKil4Rz1qJidMSWQejRUqtf4mG/S+bvdff9/edl6lOp9WeN3lpstED0OAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/5f169/hero-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/d66e1/hero-image.webp 125w,\n/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/e7160/hero-image.webp 250w,\n/static/9887532603f10b5217db7d068b2a3092/5f169/hero-image.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/on-the-importance-of-github-stars"}},{"id":"94ef23a8-fa9d-5de6-8212-406634950a88","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport { Blog } from \"./blog.style\";\nimport BadgesGH from \"./badges-modal.png\"\nimport RecognitionProgram from \"./recognition-program.png\"\nimport Playfield from \"./layer5-community-playfield.webp\"\nimport RecognitionBanner from \"./recognition-banner.webp\"\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<Blog>\n\n<img src={RecognitionProgram} className=\"image-right-no-shadow\"/>\n\nReady to take your open source journey to the next level?

Currently, I am pursuing my \nstudies at ITM Gwalior, with a focus on building a successful career in Computer Science and Engineering.\n<h2 id=\"journey\">\"When and How did it all Start?\" ✈️</h2>\n<h3>Let's uncover the Origin Story</h3>\n\nIt all began at the start of the year when I made a resolute decision to dive into the world of open-source. Eager to contribute and make a difference, I actively participated in various communities, seeking opportunities to learn and grow.\nAmidst my exploration for exciting projects to contribute to, I stumbled upon Layer5. The moment I delved into their endeavors, I was captivated by the diverse range of tech-stack-driven initiatives they were involved in. Without hesitation, I knew that this was the perfect place for me to start.\n\nVenturing forth, I attended my very first Newcomers meet, a gateway to understanding the vibrant community and its wide array of projects. It was an enriching experience, immersing myself in the ethos of collaboration and knowledge sharing that defined the community's spirit.\nTaking a small yet significant step forward, I eagerly embraced a task assigned to me.\nI understood that even the tiniest actions can pave the way for monumental achievements. But my journey didn't halt there; fueled by my unwavering commitment, continuous skill development, and active engagement with the community, I witnessed remarkable progress.\nAnd then, within a mere two months, my dedication and contributions were acknowledged, leading to an incredible milestone—I was awarded an internship at Layer5.\n<h2 id=\"experience\">\n My Experience of Internship with Layer5🚶\n</h2>\n\n My internship at Layer5 was an extraordinary experience that allowed me to delve deep into the world of open-source and sharpen my skills in a real-world setting. \n Collaborating with talented professionals and working on cutting-edge projects enriched my understanding of various technologies and their practical applications.\n\n During my internship, I actively participated in team discussions, contributed to codebase enhancements, and gained hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and methodologies. \n This internship not only expanded my technical expertise but also provided invaluable insights into the dynamics of a professional work environment and including I was able to improve my communication skills\n as well.\n Overall, my internship at Layer5 was a transformative journey filled with learning, growth, and unforgettable experiences. I look forward to leveraging the skills and knowledge gained during this internship to make a positive impact in the world of technology.\n\n <h2 id=\"message\">\n  Message to other contributors📖\n </h2>\n\n I remeber myself when I joined the community that I was not aware of many things going in the community but I didn't got off from track, I did take 2 weeks\n to solve a graphql issue but I completed it. Many things are there that you may not know during joining the community but you learn along the journey and\n there is no fear in that. The thing is you can't set back and leave if you are unable to crack something. Learn and come back strong.\n This is community , this is Layer5.\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Internship Experience with Layer5 - Sudhanshu Dasgupta","subtitle":"Unleashing the Journey:

Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Hey Vivek, thanks for having me! One day, I was scrolling through Twitter and saw someone praising the Layer5 community. I was curious, so I checked it out and joined their Slack channel. As a newbie to open-source, I was unsure about many things, but Shivam ( an amazing contributor ), welcomed me and suggested I should attend the Meshery Dev meet to learn more.\"\n      \"I picked up some issues and started working on them but soon hit a wall. Then one day, Lee Calcote messaged me and said he had me on his intern's list, but noticed I wasn't around the community much. So I reached out to Abhishek and Gaurav for help on how to get more involved. They showed me how to contribute and help others, and then I started attending dev calls, helping others, and making new friends.\"\n”After a while, I received a message from Lee and Gaurav saying that I would look good in the MeshMate logo I was surprised. It was one of the best things to happen to me, but also came with a responsibility to help others in the community and guide them on their journey.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a MeshMate and have been for some long time now. What does being a MeshMate mean to you? What does it take to be a successful MeshMate?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Being a MeshMate is not just an honor, it is also a responsibility towards the community. MeshMates are individuals who are committed to help other members of the community. This includes ensuring that community members have access to resources, are introduced to other members, and understand the vision and goals of the projects.”\n      \"I have always loved learning in a community because with a community, we can grow together. Similarly, MeshMates always make sure that their mentees are successful along with the project. It's a great feeling to be a part of a community where everyone is working towards the same goal and supporting each other along the way.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"I remember introducing Meshery and MeshMap in my college event. It was an incredibly successful event, and I take great pride in being a part of a community that supports such innovative projects. The response from the attendees was overwhelming, and I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the contributors who played a pivotal role in making this project a resounding success. Their collective efforts truly deserve admiration and appreciation.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      What is your favorite part of the Layer5 Community? Of being a MeshMate?\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"When I joined Layer5 community I got a welcome message with helping instructions so that I can contribute smoothly and I think this shows how much this community cares about their contributors which I like most about Layer5, everyone here is so welcoming and helping.\"\n      \"Being a MeshMate you get exposure in community which is really good for your growth but this is not best part of being a MeshMate, the best part is the feeling you get after helping someone and being little part of their success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      With the number of people  that join the Layer5 community everyday, how do you deal with the continued influx of newcomers?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Layer5 is big community over 4000+ members on slack and everyday so many people join Layer5 community and connecting with newcomers everyday is really not easy it takes time and your little strength too but as I said earliar, being a MeshMate also comes with responsibility which I enjoy most 😎.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Impressively, you’re also a software engineering intern at Layer5. How did this come to be? What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery and the Layer5 community?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Truelly I never joined Layer5 with mindset of internship after I joined Layer5 I saw here people learning new things as they are working on projects, making growth in their personality and improving engineering skills which is what I actually want. Layer5 offers internships all the time and these internships are offered to those who make impact in community and contribute consistently. After 2 months of making impact and contributing consistently I got mail with offer of internship.\"\n      \"Layer5 is growing everyday and many people started using Meshery, MeshMap and other projects for their businesses with this growth my personal goal is to work start helping projects in field of Devops and backend and also I like learning and sharing in public so I’ll also try to spread word of what we do here to appreciate everyone's effort.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\nNow, I’ve heard of Community Badges, but what are these? How many are there? More importantly, how do I collect the whole set?! 🙂\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Haha the way you are making impact in community soon you’ll get all Vivek, Badges are signs of contributors' efforts in their respective fields given by community. There are different badges for different efforts and I have this which represents MeshMate. I would really like to see you getting so many badges Vivek 😉.\"\n      \"Badges are not also easy to take, this requires your efforts and time towards community and its projects. As I said Layer5 community always wants its contributors' success because with their success it’s layer5's success and badges are one of the ways of recognising contributors' efforts.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re particularly proud of?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"😂 some of my favourite questions, I really like using this 🚀 emoji which represents the feeling of keep doing and keep pushing until it's done. I am mostly a night person, as I feel most productive during that time, although I don't recommend it.\"\n      \"I worked on different projects of Layer5 and I am proud for all of them though my favorite part is getting Meshery and MeshMap support default dark mode so that user will get smooth experience of using Meshery or MeshMap \"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Yes Cloud native ecosystem is so vast and constantly evolving. I think being part of cloud native community helps me stay up-to-date with its fast moving ecosystem and I’ll also suggest everyone to join community from any platform you like Slack, Twitter or your favorite platform \"\n      \"As I said Cloud native is so vast so as it’s community too there are so many updated resources available out their on internet by community, which helps me to keep update with Cloud native ecosystem\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> What  advice do you have for individuals who are hopeful to become Layer5 contributors, interns, or potentially MeshMates?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Try to come out of your comfort zone. If you are reading this conversation, you are already out of your comfort zone, which is a really good step. Who I am today is because I came out of my comfort zone, which I would also prefer. Lastly, be more helpful towards the community and, most importantly, be consistent. I wish you success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\"><img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\"/>The open source community at Layer5 is an award winning program and continues to evolve as it grows in number daily.

celebrated: we're now 4,000 members and growing. Layer5 is an open source community that stewards a number of projects spanning five GitHub organizations and over 80 repositories. Two of the community's projects have even been accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a testament to the quality of work that the members produce.\n\n<img src={mesheryMostPopular} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" />\n\nWhat makes the Layer5 community truly special, however, is not just its impressive technical achievements, but the warmth and welcoming atmosphere that it provides for its members. This is a community that is passionate about collaboration, inclusivity, and supporting each other to reach new heights.\n\n\nMembers of the Layer5 community come from all backgrounds and levels of experience, and everyone is encouraged to get involved, share their ideas, and contribute to the projects that they are interested in. The community is always open to new members, and there are plenty of resources available for those who are just starting out or looking to expand their skills.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about the Layer5 community is how supportive it is of its members. Whether you are a newcomer or a seasoned veteran, you will find that people are always willing to lend a hand, offer advice, or just provide a friendly ear when you need it.\n<Blockquote quote=\"Thank you for recognising me as a Layer5 member. It is an honour for me to be part of such a welcoming community. Even the smallest contributions are recognised. I am learning new things every day and so happy to belong to this community.\" person=\"Naureen\" />\n\nThis culture of support and collaboration has not gone unnoticed by the wider tech community. Layer5's Meshery project, for example, has been recognized as the #1 most popular Linux Foundation Internship (LFX internship).

I started going through the \n[README](https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme), and it just felt like that is it. \nIt integrates with all kinds of technologies that I ever wanted to learn and explore. Then I jumped onto their [slack](http://slack.layer5.io/) and got even \nmore excited by the enthusiasm and energy of each community members welcoming me in the newcomers channel. I started attending all the community meetings and \nlearned about the project through the demos/updates from fellow contributors. Slowly and gradually, I started contributing too, then delivering updates in the \ncommunity calls, and consequently started climbing the contributor ladder.\n\nWhen I realised that I would be working on [Layer5 Cloud](https://cloud.layer5.io) and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> as an LFX intern at Layer5, then I couldn't control my excitement. \nThat excitement was to ship more impactful features for the Layer5 projects, work and engage more deeply with the engineering team at Layer5 and have an overall \nupliftment of my development skills.  Throughout my internship I worked on several features. Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding \n[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">performance tests</Link>, \nsupporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, persisting <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with \nLayer5 Cloud, migrating Layer5 Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Layer5 Cloud and exposing performance profiles \n(generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) \nthrough a public facing API.\n\nIn terms of the learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past three months overpowers the education I received in the last two years of college, \nif we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. \nI learned and applied the tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, and NextJS to Postgres, SQL, and GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I got introduced to the topics like \nperformance engineering, service meshes, networking, and several cloud-native tool. While at the same time, I met several experienced developers who are very involved in \nthe communities which revolve around these realms.\n\nOne of the major realizations I got through this internship was that it is okay to make mistakes. There were a few instances where I made mistakes. \nFor instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query which depressed the whole production instance of Layer5 Cloud, which means no one would be able \nto log into Meshery until that gets fixed. Or once I unknowingly used an incorrect default SSH port in a workflow that failed a GitHub action responsible for \npushing the latest Layer5 Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But that was okay, and no one got mad at me, but rather I have \nalways received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I dont repeat it because that is all that matters.\n\nI had a great time as an intern @ Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PRs with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also \nlearned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also learned \nthe true meaning of team spirit. All in all, that was one of the most exquisite experiences I have ever had and ofcourse, the best internship experience \n(considering it was my first internship ever!). \n\nI will be engaged in this community and will keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"LFX Experience at Layer5 - Pranav Singh","subtitle":"An exquisite experience","date":"June 8th, 2022","author":"Pranav Singh","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/41f72/lfx-pranav.webp 125w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/8be43/lfx-pranav.webp 250w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":484.00000000000006}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/lfx-experience-at-layer5-pranav-singh"}},{"id":"7c0a735e-8a00-5434-b029-bbafa1d4900e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport MMoY2021 from \"./meshmate-of-the-year-2021.svg\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport graduateLFX from \"./aditya-chatterjee-graduates-lfx-meshery-program.webp\";\nimport MeshMate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-stack.svg\";\nimport MMOYAditya from \"./MeshMate-of-the-Year-2021-Aditya-Chatterjee.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nNurturing a diverse, inclusive, and newcomer-friendly community like Layer5's is not easy.

Here are the Fall of 2021's open source interns.\n\n</div>\n\nHear about their journeys and follow along this fall as they make waves in the Layer5 community.\n\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/\">\n    Bariq Nurlis\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Bariq } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"bariq-nurlis\"/>\n  <br/>\n      The idea of contributing to an open source has been on the back of my mind since I enrolled in college back in 2019. Like how most people formulate what and how they will do in the uni, I also came from normalcy. In Singapore, students are aiming to get the best mark in every possible lesson in college as our grades hold a very high importance in the culture. Going back and forth between classes, planning a startup with my peers, volunteering in community clubs, I had a spectacular two years in uni.\nHowever, during the last summer break, I started asking myself questions. How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you’re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad. Frankly, the experience wasn’t as good as I expected. Trying to pinch my way in a Google Summer of Code project, I am overwhelmed by numerous people trying to do the same.\n  I thought open source would be like this all the time and it failed me. But then, I took my second chance and joined Layer5. First two weeks, I tried to familiarize myself with the project and joined in the community calls. I remember sharing my screen the first time in the community call, and it was thrilling, my hands can't stop shaking. I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don't mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty. My thoughts on open source were wrong and I realize that it's just a little badness from the overall goodness. Just like Yin Yang. Layer5 has been a supportive community that not only develops your technical side, it nurtures your thinking and reasoning.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/rudraksh-pareek\">\n    Rudraksh Pareek\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Rudraksh } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"rudraksh-pareek\"/>\n  <br/>\n  My journey with open source started when I got into college and fell into the company of some geeky open source evangelists. They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software.\nHowever, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn't do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community. Whenever I was assigned something, I tried to get my teeth into it as deep as I could before reaching out for help. This helped me learn a lot in a healthy way.\n      There was so much happening around and I wanted to be a part of it all. So I started attending all the meetings and was able to put my finger into many pies. I soon became better at expressing my thoughts and pretty soon, I developed an interest in CI/CD practices. Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming.\nI learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications. However, this short span often leads to unjust outcomes.\n      Thus, I believe paying back for what you give to the project is a philosophy in the best faith of everyone in the long term. I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to.\nDuring the course of my internship, I'll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Layer5 Cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in \"on premise environments\". I'll also be collaborating with Ashish Tiwari on integrating a workflow engine with Meshery introducing best practices to be followed by management software.\nLooking forward to learning and growing during this time while continuing to try my best to help others in the community.\nThank you.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/nithish-karthik\"> Nithish Karthik </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Nithish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"nithish-karthik\"/>\n  <br />\n     I knew exactly what I wanted to do ever since my childhood, I wanted to become a programmer. Technology related stuff always intrigued me. But I had to prepare for an entrance examination IITJEE which required enormous dedication and focus to succeed. And so, I had to put my coding dreams on hold till I joined college.\nBut after I joined college, I felt a sense of freedom within me, in the sense that I could now pursue my passion wholeheartedly. So, the next question was, \"Where do I start ?\".\nThere were a lot of buzz words going around in my college among my peers like CP, Dev, AI and ML etc. I also noticed that people were forcing themselves to do them even when they had no sense of passion or appreciation towards the field. But for me, I always had more joy in the process of doing something than the outcome I get from it. So, I started exploring various fields to find what I loved the most. And I found that I wanted to do development.\n  So, I started working on myself. After I got the fundamentals clear, I wanted to have some practical experience to have an idea of how production grade products are being made. So, I worked on a couple of startups to get an exposure to real world development. And I learned a lot during that period. But then, I felt I needed to switch my gear. The idea of open source has always intrigued me the most but my efforts towards open source contribution has not been a success because,\n\n1. I always got intimidated by the size of codebase\n2. I didn't have people guiding me\n\nSome of my seniors, who had the best interest in me, encouraged me to get into open source, but I did not take it seriously because I felt intimidated by the idea. I instead thought I would look for some open source internships that way I would have someone mentoring me and that would help me in starting my open source journey. I went through many programs but most of them were closed at that time, except, Meshery in LFX. I thought, this is the only choice I have, let's do it, I had nothing to lose. I applied for that program and as a prerequisite, I had to engage with the community. I looked at the community calendar and I saw that there was a newcomer's call that day and I attended it. I have never had such a warm welcome in any other communities.\nOn that day, I knew that this community is special and I should spend more time with it. I explored the projects and as usual, I felt intimidated, but this time, I had people, wonderful people to help me. I landed my first open source PR, which was a single line style change. But the encouragement and support I got from the community for that was so wonderful . I realised that this community is not just about building best quality products but also about building best quality human beings. It has been a roller coaster ride with Layer5 since then. I got so involved with the process that I had stopped caring about getting that internship.\n   The community has really wonderful people who taught me not only about coding, but also about \"How to be\". I am really grateful that I found this community and I hope that everyone has a chance to experience this. \nI started engaging more in the community projects, especially Meshery UI and always kept coming up with ways to improve it.\n    And fast forward to September 2021, I was told to enroll for the LFX fall term mentorship program and here I am. But, this has never been the goal for me, there is more to me and Layer5 than this internship. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can.\n    Thank you\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/ashish-tiwari\"> Ashish Tiwari </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Ashish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"ashish-tiwari\"/>\n  <br />\n  I started my programming career in 2020 when my classmates were bagging internships.I started late because the first two years of my college I never thought that I was a \"programming guy\" as I always was more of a Physics/Mathematics guy. But in 2020, when the pandemic hit I started programming from \"hello world\". I thought I was too late to the party and often felt overwhelmed. After 1 year of getting a taste of everything from data structures, web development, databases and everything in between that a CS undergraduate comes across; I thought to call myself a Backend dev. But I still was dissatisfied and finding something interesting when I came across the concept of containerization which looked magic to me. From there it was a roller coaster ride to kubernetes and then understanding service meshes. I immediately was drawn into the entire CNCF ecosystem.\n  After procrastinating for a while, I learnt golang one night, made a side project to feel confident in it and dove back into watching CNCF talks explaining some exciting technology in Golang code.During all this my friend and also my current mentor, Utkarsh helped me through and through. He explained to me what Meshery is and I was immediately drawn in because Meshery is a good vantage point to the entire CNCF ecosystem. Believe me, while working on meshery at one point or another you will run into almost all major projects under CNCF. \nLike for any other beginner, it was all too overwhelming but exciting at the same time. Man it's such a rush when you realize that you don't know so much stuff because then there is an open window for absorbing all that stuff. I started going through docs, blogs and CNCF talks(shit that rhymed). I still binge CNCF talks. There is a plethora of good talks for you, if you are a beginner. I always prefer those over any \"youtube tutorials\". Anyways, back to my journey.\n  So two months ago, I found an open issue in mesheryctl. I solved the issue/enhancement, showed the code in a community meeting and got the PR merged. This was my first ever open source contribution. From there it just took off. I wrote a new command in mesheryctl then wrote unit tests. All this while trying to get an opportunity to write code for any core component like meshery server or adapters. Then one day I accidentally got into a WASM filter meeting(believe me,joined accidentally), got asked to add one feature and I said - \"yes\". And this is how it starts for most people. You get out of your comfort zone and say \"yes\", start learning new stuff, make mistakes, get corrected and the cycle continues. Fast forward two months, I was offered an internship.From what I have learnt as a person who started late is that you only need two things- \"Curiosity\" to ask questions out of your comfort zone and \"Resilience\" to absorb answers when they are thrown at you. Layer5 is an amazing community.\n  I guarantee you will not find such a warm and welcoming community so easily. If you come here for internships, you won't be here for long (or anywhere else to be honest). When your goals are solely to gain knowledge, experience while contributing to a niche, new and exciting tech- the opportunities will be waiting for you. I still have a long way to go and so much to learn. My journey with this project is certainly going to be longer than the span of this internship.\n  \\- Nithish, Ashish, Rudraksh and Bariq\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Fall Interns of 2021","subtitle":null,"date":"September 1st, 2021","author":"Interns of Fall 2021","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/ba84b/fall-interns.webp 750w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/3780a/fall-interns.webp 1080w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/bed15/fall-interns.webp 1366w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.39479166666666665}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/819ab/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/dcaba/fall-interns.webp 125w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fbfcc/fall-interns.webp 250w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/819ab/fall-interns.webp 500w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/478bc/fall-interns.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":198}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/meet-the-fall-interns-of-2021"}},{"id":"2e446807-bf62-5c69-ad6c-6261148f4a96","body":"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\nimport Sandy from \"./sandySCA.webp\";\nimport Abiola from \"./abiolaSCA.webp\";\nimport Cynthia from \"./cynthiaSCA.webp\";\nimport Elizabeth from \"./elizabethSCA.webp\";\nimport Blossom from \"./blossomSCA.webp\";\nimport Joy from \"./joySCA.webp\";\nimport Naimat from \"./naimatSCA.webp\";\n\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n    Layer5 participated as a suporting organization in the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa Contributhon</a> which started on April 1, 2021.

It was in the middle of the pandemic, though, with my mind trying to find an escape, that I stumbled upon Layer5. Within the first week of joining the Layer5 community, I had a pull request posted, and much to my surprise, found myself demo'ing it in the very next community meeting. In retrospect, it was a minor pull request, making some UI changes for Meshery. The encouragement I received was so welcoming and supportive. After that first week's experience, and so much technology and projects to explore, I was hooked - there was no turning back for me from that point.\n      I started learning more about the projects in Layer5 and its tech stack. From how Meshery Server was using gRPC and protobufs to communicate with each of its service mesh adaptors to defining how <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI Conformance</Link> works and the <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"https://layer5.io/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link> specification to how Meshery UI leverages some awesome libraries like NextJS, BillboardJS, and Redux. It has been through contributing to  each of these areas, that I have learned each of these technologies more deeply and it was all possible because of the continuous influx of awesome support from the community, especially <Link to=\"/community/members/abishek-kumar\">Abishek Kumar</Link> <i>and I probably won't stop poking him for support anytime soon</i>.\n      As I look forward to a structured internship with Layer5 through Google Summer of Code this summer, I do so knowing I will be collaborating with the large Layer5 community, engineers from other technology companies and spending a lot of time with Soham and Piyush. For my part, I'll be working on a visual topology to help service mesh operators map their deployments, model their application performance, and parse their service proxy logs. I am ready to make an impact, learn more, and help other community members ( and watch as they, too, are initiated into the Layer5 community through ritual of giving an awkward first-timer introduction in our Community Meeting 😛).\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/piyush-singariya\">\n    Piyush Singariya\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Piyush } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"piyush-singariya\" />\n      It all started with an idea, the idea of doing open source contributions. And with that after scrolling through many open source communities, I found Layer5, jumped up into our Slack workspace, started learning about Meshery. I raised a PR and was immediately made to feel like a rockstar. I began  meeting more of the community members, learning more about Meshery and its command line client, `mesheryctl` with each contribution. And you know, its extrenely gratifying to have your pull request merged, and that feeling is amplified by the feedback and attention you receive as a contributor at Layer5.\n      I knew that I wanted to engage even more deeply and learn all that I can from the seasoned engineers at Layer5. And so, I applied for internship. Layer5 takes internships seriously and doesn't accept anyone into internship until you have proven your commitment to their awesome projects.\n    And at the time of writing this, it’s been almost three months of contributing bfore being accepted as GSoC student. I have spent most of my time focusing on Layer5’s Meshery project and it’s command line client, `mesheryctl`.\n      And so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2021 program, which began on the night of May 17th, 2021 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). I am hyped up and excited to go ahead with Layer5 for the upcoming months.\n      My GSoC project is about introducing interesting and important features to Meshery Server and `mesheryctl`. Such as automating Documentation and Interactive playground for Meshery Server’s REST API endpoints, adding commands related to performance testing and enhancing Meshery’s environment health checking, introducing unit testing for `mesheryctl`, and CI/CD and documentation for all the new features.\n      It has been 2 weeks since I have started my GSoC’21 tenure with the Layer5 community, and from the very beginning (I mean before GSoC), I have learned a lot with my code contributions and the Community here. I began with setting up the performance command under mesheryctl and Open API Specification 2.0 for REST API documentation to the project. I am learning a lot of new things, like Unit Testing, Open API Specification, and much more to include.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/soham-sonawane\"> Soham Sonawane </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Soham } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"soham-sonaware\" />\n      I got to know about Layer5 last year in December when one of my batchmates told me that he was contributing to the community. He asked me if I wanted to join Slack and wanted to contribute to a project. So I looked at the projects on Github and some open issues that I could contribute to. Me being a frontend developer I saw an issue related to removing whitespaces and minor frontend changes. I just made a PR and it was merged then I joined the Slack workspace and attended the <Link to=\"/community/newcomers\">Newcomers</Link> meeting. I was introduced to a lot of things that I could work on. All of them felt amazing and interesting, all I had to do was “signal” and I could work on any one of them.\n    At first I thought that I should just work on layer5.io or maybe NightHawk, but then I was given an opportunity to work on something that I had never done before. It has been around 4 months that I have been a part of the community and I am actively trying to add to the project attending weekly meetings where everyone shares amazing stuff about what they did.\n      As I said earlier my project is something that I had never worked on before, very interesting to work on, it adds one of the most important and unique features to Meshery. Meshery's MeshMap enables users to visualize their service meshes, look at important statistics. It also enables users to design their own service meshes by either importing their designs from a yaml file or by dragging and dropping service mesh components into a\n    canvas, creating edges, grouping components, persisting these designs to see or edit later, realizing these designs by actually deploying them as service meshes and a lot more.\n    My job is to be the God of CytoscapeJS, who knows every nook and cranny of the library that enables us to create the visual topology. It's been a week since I have started my LFX internship and I have been working on visual topology even before that. These months of contributing code have taught me a lot. The first task that was given to me was to explore the\n    CytoscapeJS library and demonstrate a proof of concept of animated edges between 2 components. I sat for 3 hours straight right after the community meeting creating the demo and posted a video on our slack. I was never\n    appreciated better than on that day. I have never looked back since, each time I am given a feature or issue or any request I try my hardest to realize it in the earliest. I am constantly trying to improve myself and add to the project.\n  \\- Dhruv, Piyush, and Soham\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Summer Interns of 2021","subtitle":null,"date":"June 4th, 2021","author":"Interns of Summer 2021","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/summer-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABAAAQUxQSGQAAAABcFtr25o88QR3d3cvwxK6AC2dDkBN72P4AGEAOlgsIgJHCXDnQCz2YHtdHnbEF0DCBKHe9LOfN80BrrwM8WEE1AQ8v9bnhjcEJNKAPrIzi+B818qDhlEttZp+e61W147/088CVlA4IGYAAACQAwCdASoUAAUAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZAABHoV+8RiKrokAAP7+400U/hjfJHvPefa1O9FA2/QHgy6inrA2rR6X/zGBL8//g3I+Z49f/wXhnpHMcgAIo99chAo92CPdZdQYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/d6f9c/summer-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/82f05/summer-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/05038/summer-intern.webp 1080w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/5f183/summer-intern.webp 1366w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/d6f9c/summer-intern.webp 1917w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.25508607198748046}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/summer-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABAAAQUxQSGQAAAABcFtr25o88QR3d3cvwxK6AC2dDkBN72P4AGEAOlgsIgJHCXDnQCz2YHtdHnbEF0DCBKHe9LOfN80BrrwM8WEE1AQ8v9bnhjcEJNKAPrIzi+B818qDhlEttZp+e61W147/088CVlA4IGYAAACQAwCdASoUAAUAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZAABHoV+8RiKrokAAP7+400U/hjfJHvPefa1O9FA2/QHgy6inrA2rR6X/zGBL8//g3I+Z49f/wXhnpHMcgAIo99chAo92CPdZdQYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/a2885/summer-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/38508/summer-intern.webp 125w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/b8c78/summer-intern.webp 250w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/a2885/summer-intern.webp 500w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/efaf3/summer-intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":128}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/meet-the-summer-interns-of-2021"}},{"id":"00a26b73-8364-5c1f-a68d-60f8cc7c16d8","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport img from \"./jash-patel-layer5-maintainer.webp\";\nimport { MeetTheMaintainer } from \"../../MeetTheMaintainer.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n  <MeetTheMaintainer>\n\n<div className=\"intro \">\n\n      Next on Layer5 Meet the Maintainer’s series, we have Jash Patel.

Many people inside and outside of the\n    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions but may not\n    know the backstory as to who Jash is and how you arrived at your maintainer\n    role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made\n    you stay?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      Back in August 2020, I was looking for an open-source organization. I found\n    my friend\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/tanuj-agarwal\"> Tanuj </Link> was part of Layer5,\n    and I thought of joining it. I jumped onto my first community call, and Whoo!\n    It was so smooth. I was delighted to see the overwhelming response of the community.\n    I loved the way the community encouraged every newcomer to their first contribution.\n    After that, I never looked back. I still remember my first community meeting\n    in which I introduced myself, highlighting my interests in React. The response\n    was <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\"> Lee </Link> giving an overly positive reaction.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n      I can totally relate to how amazing the Layer5 onboarding process is unique!\n    Layer5 Projects has many active, open-source projects. You’ve been\n    consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently\n    focusing on? Psst. Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      I started contributing to docs and soon dived into Layer5 websites. While I\n    have worked on almost all websites, t (a little in some). The next\n    generation Layer5 website (built on Gatsby) was the site I worked on the\n    longest. We recently launched this new site (it takes a lot to launch a\n    website). Currently, I am working on enhancements to the website and on\n    Layer5’s upcoming discussion forum. I think, after this, you would already\n    know my favorite one.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n      Definitely, winks! Have you worked with any other open source project? How\n    does Layer5 compare?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      I am a part of my college’s open-source organization. I have contributed to\n    and also have mentored a few open-source projects there. Open source is\n    always fun - it doesn't matter where you do it. The difference I found here\n    was the vast and diverse community that was missing there. Also, exposure to\n    different technologies was advantageous for me.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n      You know for me, coming to The Next Generation Layer5 Website was done in\n    the space of 6 months which is really impressive. How was the team able to\n    pull that off?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      It was a pretty big task. Many people have worked on it(At the time of\n    launch we had 140 contributors). It started with Tanuj and me, and then got\n    many hands to help us and strive towards its completion. I can’t write all\n    those names, or else it would take an entire page to note them down. And\n    this is what communities are meant for; open source is intended for. It was\n    a combined effort, and we worked on almost everything. The team worked on\n    Gatsby, GraphQL, SEO, Analytics, and anything related to the website. The\n    two mentors <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\"> Lee </Link> and\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\"> Nikhil </Link>,\n    were quite helpful for the team to bring it through 6 months.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      It’s amazing you are in school and still actively contribute to Layer5, how\n    are you able to multitask it?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n      I once mentioned that while my exams were going on, I would study the entire\n    day, and when I took breaks, I would just open up Github and work on some\n    minor issues. If you are interested in it, you will find a way, I would say.\n    This is what helped me. One of the advantages of being in such a diverse\n    environment is that when you are stuck somewhere, the work doesn't stop,\n    some other contributor picks it up, and it goes on.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      I’m really curious, what does being a Layer5 maintainer mean to you? How has\n    being a maintainer impacted you?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n      I still remember my first pull request being reviewed. And now I am on the\n    other side, reviewing requests. Being a maintainer was a rollercoaster of an\n    experience to me. You don’t just review PRs and point out changes, but you\n    also have to think of fixes for them. The evolution of green to purple is\n    the joy every open-source contributor wishes to see. And me being the one\n    doing it makes me feel good. Being a maintainer adds responsibility on the\n    one hand and gives freedom on the other hand.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      I really picked a lot of points on that! Do you have any advice for\n    individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n      My advice would be to not look for becoming something. I never thought of\n    becoming a maintainer. You just enjoy whatever you are doing, and when the\n    time comes, you will get it. Being a maintainer is always special, but\n    what's more critical is contributing healthily. A maintainer was always a\n    contributor first, and it is that experience that sails them through. I have\n    already recommended many of my friends and would like to share it with you;\n    if you want to learn open source, Layer5 is the place. We, as a community,\n    are always excited to have more people on board and learning something new\n    from here. I would love to share the stage with you shortly.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      That was some great advice there and tips! Thanks, Jash for all you do for\n    the community. It’s lovely having you as a maintainer.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      That was some great advice there and tips!

The MeshMate program pairs\n  experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a\n  smooth onboarding experience. Helping community members takes all forms from\n  ensuring the member has access to resources, is introduced to others,\n  understands the vision and goals of projects, can build and contribute to\n  projects, can use projects and have their feedback heard. MeshMates aid in\n  identifying areas of projects and activities within the community to engage\n  within, which working groups to join, and in help community members grow in\n  their open source and cloud native knowledge.\n  There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move\n  fast. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates share tips on how to have the best\n  community experience possible, but also build a relationship with the\n  community member inevitably leaving a lasting mark as is evident from member\n  comments about Nikhil.\n  \n<h3 style={{ padding: \"2rem 0\" }}>It's not easy being a MeshMate</h3>\n\n  With thousands of members in the Layer5 community, many come and go.

To help them acheive their goals, each individual\n  is engaged 1:1 by their Meshmate, supporting them in becoming a landstanding\n  Layer5 community member and contributor. MeshMates understand that many\n  mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all overcome their\n  hurdles in finding an area of the community to call home or aspect of a\n  project to own.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  style={{ width: \"100%\" }}\n  style={{ position: \"relative\" }}\n  quote=\"Congratulations on being our community maintainer superstar, Nikhil.

Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the affects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Michael is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      Hey Shriti, thank you for having me. If I remember correctly, I was looking for a professional focus area earlier this year, and landed on service meshes. I had worked with service meshes before, which piqued my initial interest. I had worked with Istio as part of my work for some time, and in the same context I stumbled across Meshery. I wasn’t able to dig deep in Meshery back then, but the concept sounded fascinating to me. Additionally, I had been benefiting from open source, both personally and professionally for a long time, but apart from a few minor contributions, I had never been able to give back to the community. I hoped to correct that.\n\n      I re-discovered Meshery and the Layer5 community, listened to a recording of a community meeting, and read a couple of blog posts describing the community and member experience posts. One that stood out for me was a post by <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\">MeshMate Nikhil Ladha</Link>. Going by his words, it appeared to be a warm, diverse and active community. My suspicions were confirmed when I joined. Layer5 offers a wholesome, interactive community in addition to unbiasedly providing help and guidance around the virtual corner.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?<br />\n      <i>Psst.</i> Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I’m a technical architect and programmer, which made the backend, especially the adapters, a natural choice for me. It involves both contributing to the management plane, but also looking at and using service meshes from an architectural point of view. The possible implementations of service meshes is an area that has been particularly fascinating for me.\n\n      I’d probably continue to work with the Meshery adapters for now before moving on to other areas of the project. Haha, I would probably name the Meshery Adapter Library as my favorite Layer5 project till date.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I have worked and collaborated with several open source communities before, including Eclipse Modelling Framework and Apache ServiceMix. I couldn’t possibly make a very accurate comparison, given my limited interaction with other communities, but the Layer5 community stands out based on the unique and extremely inclusive approach it takes towards upholding community values.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      What is so fascinating about service meshes?\n    </div>\n\n    <img className=\"right\" src={MoireCircles} alt=\"Moiré circle pattern\" />\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I find meshes intriguing in general. Meshes can look intricate, layered and complicated at a first glance, and yet they are built on the most basic principles. For me, meshes are visual structures, complete with an aesthetic and artistic dimension.\n\n      Fun Fact: Overlapping meshes resulting in Moiré patterns are an example of this. They appealed to me from a young age, and I learned about their mathematics from my mathematics teacher.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically though?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      An increasing number of applications nowadays consist of distributed services, both in the cloud and on-premises, in mixed and hybrid environments. Many legacy applications are in express need of modernisation, consuming and being consumed by cloud native applications. Introducing microservices, also by refactoring monolithic applications, increases the complexity of the service landscape. By delegating cross-cutting infrastructure concerns like security, traffic management, resilience, and observability to the service mesh, some of the complexity is moved from the applications to the service mesh, allowing application developers to focus on business logic. A concern in these distributed, dynamic and scalable systems is that the security also needs to scale. If security doesn’t scale, it becomes very challenging to handle such systems. Service meshes today are already able to support many of these scenarios, and are continuously improving.\n\n      Service meshes are complex but that is something I enjoy attempting as a challenge, to have control and overview and make it appear simple, investing into automating options. Another field that I’m excited to learn about continuously is related to the security of distributed systems, and how service meshes contribute to implementing a zero trust network architecture.\n\n      I actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgfeller/status/1289951164281233408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dreamed about service mesh</a> a while ago. That was almost a bit spooky.\n    </div>\n\n    <img className=\"right\" src={MoireLines} alt=\"Moiré line pattern\" />\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Haha. Leading on that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      Meshery currently does a great job of providing a neutral platform. Continuing in that direction would be a superb base plan. Enabling innovative applications from vendors, supporting all service meshes, integrating best practice methods, and implementing the SMP and SMI abstractions would probably score the top five positions in Meshery’s new year resolutions in 2021.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Interesting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      At the moment, Meshery provides a management plane solution and provides support for the SMI and <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Mesh Performance</a> (SMP) specifications. Helpful additions in the future should be the configuration based best practices, especially with regards to security and to possibly extend to owning up specific routes on security. For instance by verifying that the recommendations outlined in the NIST report “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture” by Ramaswamy Chandramouli and Zack Butcher.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      What are today's challenges when working with service meshes?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I can’t claim to have worked with many implementations, and to have a good overview and wide experience. A lot of the complexity is already handled, but there is still enough to decide and implement for each solution. The solution makes for a challenging but highly interesting task. Additionally, there are a variety of different solutions from different vendors, which is excellent but it also makes it hard to know which would be the best fit for a given situation. Here, again, Meshery can be of invaluable help.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      The service mesh promise holds a lot of potential, for instance for modernization and ease of use. A lot appears to be happening these times. It will be interesting to see how serverless solutions will be integrated. Enabling a seamless implementation experience for solutions embracing multi-cloud, on-prem and legacy systems is also something to look forward to. Additionally, service meshes are aimed at making your architecture more secure and stable, which makes security a big concern for any service mesh provider. Improvements along these points will be topics I’ll be watching out for over the next few years.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Ah while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up. Cloud Native and especially, the field of service meshes evolving exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      Service mesh implementations consist of many components, and I try to stay up to date in general. Try to follow as much as possible conferences and vendor announcements, blog posts etc. mainly by following related Twitter accounts. Also, trying to find some time to explore various solutions. Lee’s books are of course an excellent source. Another book I can recommend is *Zero Trust Networks* by Gilman and Barth. It really helped me to understand how service meshes relate to zero trust network architecture and can help to move towards it.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I take my role as a Meshery maintainer with its benefits and responsibilities. For one, it means to be able to give back to the community. I meet a lot of interesting and friendly people from around the globe, learning about their culture at the same time. Additionally, Open Source allows me to work on and dive into tasks as I like, making it easy to integrate the work with my existing work schedule. It also allows me to learn a lot, expanding on my understanding of service meshes, keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and also giving me the opportunity to witness first-hand how others are using them. This has a quite direct impact on my full-time role, complementing the work I do.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      A general love for software development combined with a readiness to help out newcomers and participating in the growing community is the key.\n\n      Come and visit, there is something for everyone, be it frontend, backend, CI/CD, website, documentation, standards, interfacing with other communities, and more. The friendly community members and the meshmates will provide support and guidance. Browse the Layer5 and Meshery websites and the repositories on GitHub, where issues suitable for newcomers are especially tagged.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"note\">\n      <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100\" width=\"100\" alt=\"Forklift illustration\" />\n      In his relatively short tenure at Layer5, Michael has already delivered a wave of meshy contributions enhancing the Meshery adapters and improving upon Meshery’s architecture.

Being fairly new\n    to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to\n    delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm\n    welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation\n    jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the\n    task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings\n    hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I\n    finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!\n    It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\n      Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being\n    a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and\n    GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to\n    expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a\n    continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush\n    Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have\n    spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the\n    project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began\n    helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to\n    do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I\n    recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a\n    MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring\n    positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward\n    to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊\n  <br />\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/kelechi-nwachukwu\">\n      Kelechi Precious Nwachukwu\n    </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Kelechi }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"kelechi-precious\"\n  />\n      It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn't\n    something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I\n    stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of\n    projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa\n    (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.\n      A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you\n    some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I\n    recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and\n    managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my\n    hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous\n    tech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too\n    ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow\n    made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another\n    task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a\n    peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the\n    only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was\n    not.\n      I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would\n    previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different\n    approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was\n    amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have\n    helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an\n    invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I\n    have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly\n    environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may\n    not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having\n    a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing\n    determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\"> Ruth Ikegah </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Ruth }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"ruth-ikegah\"\n  />\n      The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a\n    close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.\n    Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only\n    6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came\n    to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel,\n    after which I visited the <Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io\">GitHub repository</Link> and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.\n      To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.\n      Impressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon\n    began helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading. Experience an open-source community with Layer5 today! Once you’re set up on Slack, do send me a ping to\n    say hi. The exciting part, we might even meet as MeshMates 😉\n  \\- Tanuj, Ruth, and Kelechi\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing a new line of MeshMates","subtitle":null,"date":"September 25th, 2020","author":"Our MeshMates with 🤍","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/5af24/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/a16f1/meshmate-announcement.webp 125w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/fcddb/meshmate-announcement.webp 250w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/5af24/meshmate-announcement.webp 500w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/87c93/meshmate-announcement.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":337}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-a-new-line-of-meshmates"}},{"id":"bd19c992-298c-515b-b2d6-0288d77ab971","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport SignedBook from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nGetting involved in something new and essentially avant garde, can be a messy challenge to navigate through. But, when it comes to contributing to Meshery it only gets more and more meshy!\n\n### Get set go!\n\nI was introduced to the world of open source through the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a> project in the august of 2019 and have since then been continuously exploring the farthest reaches of Meshery, Layer5, the parent SMI project and consecutively the CNCF landscape.\nAt the time of writing this, I have been a part of the Meshery project for about a year. Fascinated by the concept and further lured in by the welcoming community at Layer5, I was soon dipping my toes into the tidal wave of code. Starting out with small contributions to improve the UI, I stumbled on to my first issue, which was to open a page in a new tab instead of opening it in the same tab. Basic, right?\n\nI’m pointing this out to unravel the myth and smoke clouds around open source projects. Contributing can be as easy as altering a few lines of code and can be as meaningful as writing a whole new feature adapter. Since then, I have crossed small and big hurdles, meandering through countless issues and have become a part of the wholesome community, gaining friends and mentors along the way.\n\n### Stepping stones\n\nLet’s begin with the basics. What is Layer5?\n\nAt Layer5, we champion developer-defined infrastructure, giving engineers the power to reshape application delivery. We empower operators in reimagining how they manage modern infrastructure: collaboratively.\n\n### Roadblocks\n\nComing to my contributions at Layer5, I have mostly been involved in improving the UI and shaping the company site’s present outlook. I have also tried my hand at other projects, including the `mesheryctl` and the `landscape` at Layer5. In fact, here is a comprehensive list of **[my contributions across Layer5 projects](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+author%3ANikhil-Ladha+org%3Alayer5io)**.\n\nThe above mentioned links are just the **visible** contributions made by me. With time, I have grown and was soon approached to become a [MeshMate](/community/meshmates), an initiative which involves few seasoned contributors like me who will hold the hand of a new member and help him/her bridge the gap and take the leap into open source.\n\n### Tricks of the Trade\n\nThe benefits of being a UI engineer?\n\nWeb developers are required in every company in one meaningful way or the other as every single project needs a frontend to showcase it’s capabilities to the user. Coming to Layer5, the frontend of Meshery is built on React( another masterpiece from Facebook! ), which I learned from scratch when I joined the community.\n\n<img src={SignedBook} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"Nikhil-ladha-work\" />\n\nNow, months have passed and with some healthy dedication and hours of staring at thousands of lines of code, I have a good base and practical experience with React, something which you can’t hope to gain from personal projects and require a community for.\n\nThe Layer5 and Meshery websites are built using Jekyll, another technology about which I didn’t have any practical knowledge a couple of months ago. Easier than react and harder than CSS, Jekyll is perfect for the aspiring web developers out there and is also another reason for you to pop over to the Layer5 repo after reading this article.\n\n### Meshy goodness<br/>\n\nMy experience at Layer5 has made me proud of the work that we do and has challenged me time and again to reach for higher goals. I still have a hunch that someway or the other my contributions are responsible for getting me an internship at Red Hat! All heads bowed to [Lee Calcote](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote/) for his presence and guidance and to the Layer5 community for being as amazing as it is. My journey at Layer5 has been an ever growing curve to be honest from just a contributor to a MeshMate to the maintainer of few projects at Layer5. And, true to god this wouldn’t have been possible without the combined effort from me and our very own Lee Calcote. His trust and confidence in me is what encourages me to contribute more and more at Layer5 and see it grow to some next level in the coming future.\nMotivated or moved or still confused?\n\nWant to experience the same feeling and see yourself recognized as an Open-source contributor?\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My journey from a contributor to a maintainer!","subtitle":"","date":"August 11th, 2020","author":"Nikhil Ladha","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/5f169/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/d66e1/pic1.webp 125w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/e7160/pic1.webp 250w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/5f169/pic1.webp 500w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/3cd29/pic1.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-journey-from-a-contributor-to-a-maintainer"}},{"id":"a45a606d-6f4a-5ecd-883a-d61a271c015d","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nI started a new job at [RemoteState](https://www.linkedin.com/company/remotestate/) as a software development engineer in May of 2020.\nPost the initial plunge, settling into the role was relatively easier for me due to the experience I had gained in working on open source contributions in the Layer5 community. My experience with open source had also been a big plus for me throughout the application and interview process. As a direct result, my colleagues and seniors became genuinely inquisitive about Meshery and its functionality as the Kubernetes Manager. So when asked, I happily agreed  to deliver a session on the subject to the entire team.\n\nI pitched my idea to [Lee Calcote](https://layer5.io/community/members/lee-calcote) and in his usual supportive form, he was as excited as I was about the session. A brainstorm session led to creating an entire presentation with suggestions from Lee. The Layer5 community offers a number of resources to contributors, including these two decks ([Meshery - the cloud native management plane](https://layer5.io/meshery) and [Layer5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tLcMcyQ-Z6YYISYyR0Eyb30dojQiKHIjs7Rt5m8kcag/edit?usp=sharing) that I drew from as a basis for a personalized presentation and demonstration to my new team.\n\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQNpnp_SIkYNMe1rx-Cw_armxHRmQvkcp8d3BVML6XEhsSgy7k0w9xDKrGGs4EPew/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowfullscreen={true} mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></center>\n\nWhen the day arrived to present the concepts of cloud native infrastructure, Meshery, and other cloud native initiatives to my team, I held a Google Meet with a full attendance. I started the session with a reader’s digest version of microservices and cloud native infrastructure to set the stage for any newcomers to the world of cloud native, I went on to elaborate on Layer5 ‘s contributions to the CNCF landscape and the SMI project. This was followed by an in-depth discussion on data planes, control planes, and management planes. I spoke at-length about Meshery’s functionality including, its features for facilitating the benchmarking, interoperability and standardization of cloud native infrastructure. I wrapped up the session with some insider tips that I have learned in my months as an open source contributor in the Layer5 community. In the stream of feedback received from my colleagues, the session seems to have been a success.\n\nThis whole experience has been an amazing journey for me. From being a complete noob to utilizing my expertise in the cloud native infrastructure domain to landing an actual job, the experience has been a maze of ups and downs. But, I feel like I have finally arrived and arrived with a pot of gold. I’m eternally grateful to Lee Calcote for motivating me and providing me with the appropriate resources. Entering and exploring an open source community can be a daunting task and the [resources provided by Layer5](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) helped them in overcoming that challenge and enabled them to learn more about the widespread work of [Meshery](https://meshery.io).\n\nI’m glad to have found a community that not only feeds my professional success, but also my personal growth. It’s not out of obligation, but out of a sense of gratitude and paying it forward to others (a tenant of the Layer5 community) that I now spend much of my time as a MeshMate. I help welcome and guide other new contributors along their open source path as they learn and grow. Giving to others and while continuing to grow professionally and personally is time well spent.   I encourage you to join me and others in the Layer5 community by jumping into our [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/) to start meshing around!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How I schooled my seniors","subtitle":"and why I swear by the experience","date":"August 4th, 2020","author":"Nupur Thakur","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/15f20/feature-image.webp 750w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/9a568/feature-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp 1188w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6691919191919192}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/d03f3/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/a16f1/feature-image.webp 125w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/48571/feature-image.webp 250w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/d03f3/feature-image.webp 500w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/976f0/feature-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":335}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/how-i-schooled-my-seniors"}},{"id":"84298721-6095-5aac-89d3-02e19185dfe3","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport pic1 from \"./pic1.webp\";\nimport pic2 from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\nimport pic3 from \"./pic3.webp\";\nimport pic4 from \"./pic4.webp\";\nimport pic5 from \"./pic5.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nIt all started 9 months ago when I stumbled across the following LinkedIn post, written by a college senior who had recently scored an internship with Redhat.\n\n<img src={pic3} alt=\"book\"/>\n\nThis led me to a long-winding conversation with Subham Kumar Rai and Anand Kumar Singh about Layer5 and how amazing an opportunity it would be to be a part of this emerging community. I did some research on Kubernetes and made my way to the Layer5 Github repo. From there, it was a swift journey to the Layer5 Slack Channel where I truly understood what Subham had meant about the warm welcome. I was amazed by how helpful and willing the entire community was. Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).\n\n<img src={pic4} alt=\"github-profile\"/>\n\n#### What is Meshery?\n\nMeshery is a multi-platform management that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of Kubernetes and cloud platforms and applications.<br/>\n\n<img src={pic1} alt=\"meshry\"/>\n\nAs a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\n <br/>\nMeshery seamlessly integrates with every CNCF project, your existing tools, multiple Clouds and Kubernetes clusters.<br/>\n\n<img className=\"align-right\" src={pic2} alt=\"Lee Calcote\" />\n\n#### Lee Calcote\n\nLee Calcote is an innovative leader and has previously made waves in the tech community as a Docker Captain and a Cloud Native Ambassador and that is just a milestone in his impressive journey, which consists of his admirable work with developer platforms, cloud technology, containers, functions, and applications. Advanced and emerging technologies have been a consistent focus through Calcote’s tenure at SolarWinds, Seagate, Cisco, and Pelco. In my tenure at Layer5, Lee has been an amazing mentor, someone you can always look towards for encouragement, inspiration and a kind word, especially when you’re melting under the heat to make that late night deadline.\n\n\n#### Layer5 and UEM Jaipur Partnership Program\nIn an effort to foster the open source community in my college, I along with four of my batchmates (Anand, Subham, Nikhil, Gunjan) decided to start an open source partnership program, encouraged by Lee and Rupayan Das (Faculty, UEM Jaipur). This will hopefully lead to making future batches more aware about the essence of open source and encourage them to participate in communities like Layer5.\n\n<img src={pic5} alt=\"layer5\"/>\n\n#### Community Love\n\nThe Layer5 community has welcomed me with patience and has given me a sense of purpose, which is more than I could have asked for at the beginning as a novice developer. The warm welcome and a sincere string of mentors can do wonders in building your confidence and enabling you to put in your best foot forward. Open source has introduced me to a horde of essential qualities, such as the importance of teamwork, candor and earnestness. <br/>\nIt has been a prodigious journey so far and I don’t intend to stop here. The pace at which the projects under the Layer5 community are unwinding is awe-inspiring. It is my aim to be a witness and a partner in crime in its future endeavors.

My initial interest in Layer5 was sparked when, for a project in my Masters course, I was required to build a microservice architecture and develop a service layer on top of it.\nA basic Google search led me to a plethora of resources, which in turn led me to understand how different DevOps technologies could be compared. Comparison and selection of a cluster was my first step to deploying one on my VM cluster. Amidst the varied resources available to me, stumbling onto Layer5 and Meshery was a happy boon.\n\n## Why Meshery?\n\nFrom the beginning, Meshery proved to be an intuitive and easy-to-use application. Among other benefits, it could be implemented into my project with ease which was also a major contributing factor behind my choice of taking advantage of its features for my project thesis.\n\nThere are tons of resources online that compare different DevOps tools for your deployment, however, Meshery was the only project that actually offered a practical way of comparing your Kubernetes clusters. In just a few easy steps, I could download and deploy  Meshery into my VM instance and compare the performance of my microservice application running atop two different infrastructure configurations. It gathered various statistics on how they worked on my application.\n\nWhat really got my hooked though was Meshery's intuitive UI and the amazing open platform support, which made me strive to rise above and beyond my project goals, to truly understand and value the underlying idea.\n\n## Insights While Meshing Around\n\nWhile using Meshery to deploy both Istio and Linkerd, I came to the understanding that while Meshery uses common methods for interfacing with and managing cloud services, that Meshery is also capable of fully configuring all my infrastructure. This became apparent by how robust Meshery’s adapter for Istio is, which includes the ability to analyze and validate my deployment’s configuration against best practices. Each adapter includes a set of sample applications that makes it convenient to explore the functionality of different meshes, using the same application across them.\n\nThe behavior that was of keen interest to me, however, was that of my custom, microservices. When deploying my microservices application, Meshery helped me understand how different infrastructure was interacting with my software application.\n\nI learned that in addition to the easy integration of Meshery in my application, it also provides one of the best platforms out there to manage modern infrastructure configuration and gives you a fair assessment of your deployment, which can otherwise prove to be a daunting task.\n\nWhile presenting my findings to my class and professor, they were able to gauge the value that each piece of tech would bring into the microservice application.\n\n## Shout out to the Community\n\nThe Layer5 community has proved to be incredibly helpful in my journey. Communicating mainly through Slack channels, the community is vibrant and very welcoming. Any integration issues that arose for me were quickly and efficiently solved. <br />\nI am thankful that my experiences as a user, as well as a contributor, has allowed me to be a valued part of this wholesome group. Layer5 has truly made me understand the significance of an open source \"community\" and I’ll admit - I’m hooked. The number and variety of novel projects that are pushing the envelope of emerging technology within this community is enthralling. <br/>\nI’m here for the long-haul, so expect to hear from me again as I wrap my arms around these projects. If the suite of Layer5 projects interests you, please [join the community](http://slack.layer5.io)!  <br />\nThen, drop me a line as I work toward becoming a [MeshMate](https://layer5.io/community/meshmates).\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Meshy Journey","subtitle":"","date":"July 3rd, 2020","author":"Ishita Kumar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp 666w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5870870870870871}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/dc1cf/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/357be/ishita-kumar.webp 125w,\n/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/8d05a/ishita-kumar.webp 250w,\n/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/dc1cf/ishita-kumar.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":294}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/my-meshy-journey"}},{"id":"933fdd2b-b2a4-5371-bb9a-f047b72e3e23","body":"import { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport smilogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\nimport checklist from \"./checklist.svg\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img\n\tsrc={smilogo}\n\talign=\"right\"\n\talt=\"smilogo\"\n\twidth=\"200px\"\n\tstyle={{ margin: \"1rem 2rem\" }}\n/>\n\n### About SMI\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at [SMI Github Repository](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec). Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found [here](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md).\n\n### APIs in SMI\n\nCurrently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:\n\n- [Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs) - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.\n- [Traffic Access Control](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control) - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not\n- [Traffic Split](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split) - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing\n- [Traffic Metrics](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics) - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.\n\n### About SMI Conformance Tests\n\n**SMI Conformance Tests** check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?\n\nAll these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.\n\nSounds fun, right? Let's dig deeper into the SMI conformance project and find out.\n\n### Meshery'ing with Conformance Tests\n\n<img src={checklist} align=\"left\" alt=\"checklist\" width=\"250px\"/>\n\n<Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>  is _the cloud native management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.\n\nAs you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nDo you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).\n\n#### Forking [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/)\n\n`kuttl` is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It's entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked `kuttl` and modified it a little. You can see our modified version [here](https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl).\n\n\nWe are planning to use `kuttl` for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of `kuttl`.\n\n#### [Learn Layer5](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/)\n\nLearn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.\n\nThis is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and `smi-conformance` testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.\n\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.\nHead over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting SMI Conformance Testing with Meshery","subtitle":"","date":"June 25th, 2020","author":"Naveen Kumar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/smi-conformance.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdMoRwABouJpxndAAA/rk5FTx5IAPyy7bwayFHbqZeUwT5kp/jZAeb6AaWX0+j97v2lRg8t8fOoRyxzRsu40wcUtoNkON2o0AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/d0012/smi-conformance.webp","srcSet":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/1cb46/smi-conformance.webp 750w,\n/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/d0012/smi-conformance.webp 1036w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4343629343629343}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/smi-conformance.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdMoRwABouJpxndAAA/rk5FTx5IAPyy7bwayFHbqZeUwT5kp/jZAeb6AaWX0+j97v2lRg8t8fOoRyxzRsu40wcUtoNkON2o0AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/84470/smi-conformance.webp","srcSet":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/70d23/smi-conformance.webp 125w,\n/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/ba5c2/smi-conformance.webp 250w,\n/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/84470/smi-conformance.webp 500w,\n/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/a7643/smi-conformance.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":217.00000000000003}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/starting-smi-conformance-testing-with-meshery"}},{"id":"c95858c2-6e7f-5a8e-a41e-c069bc89b90b","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport issueImage from \"./issue.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I wrote [a blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/11/15/introducing-comparative-spectrums-to-the-layer5-landscape/) about introducing \"comparative spectrum\" tools to [the Layer5 landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape)—a webpage which I have transformed multiple times, now!\n\nUp until now, the contents of each blog post I have written were centered upon a freshly-opened pull request. Shortly before writing my last post, I did open [one such pull request (layer5#238)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238). However, since my PR remains open, and since I am still working on the same issue my PR addresses, I have opted to instead push [a new commit](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/commits/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495) to the aformentioned (but, now, renamed) PR instead of creating a whole new one. This newest commit introduces a major step towards resolving the issue at hand, and will be the subject of this blog post!\n\n<img src={issueImage} alt=\"Issue\"/>\n\nThe issue at hand: [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211) - add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\n* * *\n\n_**Note:** this blog post will frequently reference [the update and documentation comment that I made](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644) to accompany my last commit to my PR. I consider this hefty comment to be an extension of this blog post, so I strongly recommend giving it a read!_\n\n* * *\n\nMy initial commit towards introducing comparative spectrum tooling did not represent a full solution. Thinking about what might constitute a full solution for the issue at hand, I came up with three criteria:\n\n## What was still needed:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nWithin [Issue #211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211), Layer5 lead developer Lee indicates [four slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6) upon which comparative spectrum graphics may be based upon. During my initial commit, I created graphics that emulated those found within the first three of those four slides, but I had yet to implement the graphic found in [the fourth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12): a table. I was also less-than-satisfied with the 'grid' design I had implemented in response to [slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p10).\n\n#### 2\\. A modular design\n\nThe designs I am implementing are meant to be used to present opinionated information. As I am not nearly knowledgeable to form opinionated comparisons between DevOps tools and related technologies, I have instead made my goal to make it as easy as possible for other Layer5 contributors to utilize the graphics (\"\\[comparative\\] spectrums\") that I am designing. Doing so would require encapsulating (templating) the spectrums I design (new and old), within their own HTML files, and providing a means to easily invoke (and customize) instances of those templates into the Landscape page.\n\n#### 3\\. Documentation\n\nBecause the templates I design are intended to be implemented and customized by other contributors, it is _especially_ critical that those contributors have access to complete and thorough documentation detailing the intended use of each templated design.\n\n* * *\n\n## What I delivered:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nAs documented in my [update comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644), I designed a table that very closely resembles that of Lee's slides. Implementing the table was interesting, as it ended up requiring [quite a few nested Liquid for-loops](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495/_includes/partials/spectrum/table.html#L23). Also as documented, I revamped the grid-based tooling and am quite pleased with the improvements made. The end result of these efforts is a complete set of comparative spectrums.\n\n#### 2, 3. A modular design and documentation\n\nThe bulk of the documentation I wrote details how to deal with the modular solution that I designed and implemented to enable comparative spectrums to be included into the Landscape page (through the use of Liquid `include` tags). The documentation speaks for itself; [check it out!](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644)\n\n## What's next?\n\nI would not have considered the documentation I delivered to be complete if I did not report on the issues still present in the work I delivered. I denoted these as 'Current issues' in the documentation, and they represent work that still remains to be done. I know that I can count on the Layer5 community to assist me with small issues like these, and, once this pull request receives some forward motion, I hope to start zeroing in on its smaller issues. Fortunately, I have made plans to continue working with open source well into the new year!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Layer5: Landscape Spectrums Revisited","subtitle":"","date":"December 4th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9805825242718447}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/33b75/landscape_green.webp 52w,\n/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/d7c02/landscape_green.webp 103w,\n/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"(min-width: 206px) 206px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":490.2912621359223}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/layer5-landscape-spectrums-revisited"}},{"id":"94ec3b54-c4c3-53cd-ad1b-e5a628ad968e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport pr211 from \"./PR-211.webp\";\nimport pr2112 from \"./PR-211-2.webp\";\nimport card1 from \"./card1.webp\";\nimport card2 from \"./card2.webp\";\nimport arrow from \"./arrow.webp\";\nimport gtable from \"./graphical-table.webp\";\nimport gcomp from \"./graph-compare.webp\";\nimport image21 from \"./image.webp\";\nimport comment from \"./comment.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nDuring [Hacktoberfest 2019](https://raungar.wordpress.com/tag/layer5/), I worked on the website of [Layer5](https://layer5.io/), open source community. More specifically, my contributions concerned one specific page of that website: its [Service Mesh Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nShortly after making these contributions, I was graciously welcomed into the Layer5 community by its lead developer [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote?lang=en), who later directly approached me to assist him in furthering his vision for the Landscape page by implementing \"comparative spectrums\". Wishing to focus on my remaining two Hacktoberfest contributions at the time, I suggested surveying the interest of other potential contributors for this project. As such, an informative issue was opened:\n\n<img src={pr211} alt=\"PR 211\"/>\n\nIssue [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211): add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\nA month later, I fortunately found time enough to make some major progress into this issue.\n\n* * *\n\nThis issue is quite highly conceptual, much moreso than any other issue I have thus far worked on. I decided that the best way to approach this issue would be to focus on establishing a set of tools that could be used by more-knowledgeable contributors to later construct comparative spectrums—opinionated data visualizations. As such, my first step was to build a set of responsive graphical elements that resembled [those provided as examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6). These include:\n\n#### (1) _Sleek information cards:_\n\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><img src={card1} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    <td> or this </td>\n    <td><img src={card2} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slides 5 and 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (2) _Gradiented, labelable double-arrow banners:_\n\n<img src={arrow} alt=\"Arrow\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (3) _Graphically-augmented tables:_\n\n<img src={gtable} alt=\"Table\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 8](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12))_\n\n#### (4) _Spectrum-like graphical comparisons:_\n\n<img src={gcomp} alt=\"Comparison\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n* * *\n\n(1) Although there may exist libraries that may help construct such graphical elements, I did not want to introduce additional libraries to accomplish my work. Instead, I wanted to make good use of Layer5io's preexisting [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) library. Fortunately, Materialize strongly supports the design of card-like structures, allowing me to more easily [implement some](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-20fc098534d6aab31ad8e5c9db51bde0R10).\n\n(2) Unfortunately, it does not seem that Materialize supports the creation of graphical arrows, so I just ended up [styling my own](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R2).\n\n(3) These tables can be quite easily implemented and styled with or without the use of `<table>` tags. I anticipate these will be given a proper fleshing out after the other graphical elements are further developed.\n\n(4) These unique spectrum graphics present the most challenging, of all the comparison tools, to implement. Snaking spectrum bar aside, I needed to develop a _responsive_ solution that (a) allowed contributors to programmatically place image thumbnails at preset horizontal positions, while (b) ensuring those thumbnails placed at the same position do not overlap with one another (and instead align vertically atop each other).\n\nThis presented a problem to solve: I required a means to 'float' elements toward a horizontal line; to 'stack' thumbnails atop one another, without overlap, if they are given the same horizontal position. After researching quite deeply into potential solutions to this problem, I ended up stumbling across some CSS property-value pairings that I had never heard of before: [`display: grid`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [`grid-auto-flow: row dense`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid-auto-flow.asp). Miraculously, I discovered that these could actually function as [a basis for a solution](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R76).\n\n* * *\n\nAfter styling the graphical elements, I continued the website's trend of using [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid) tags (e.g. [`for`](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/iteration-tags#for)) and [YAML lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) to help modularize my solutions, which should aid future contributors in generalizing them.\n\n* * *\n\nI opened [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238) to share my work as well as invite collaboration:\n\n<img src={pr2112} alt=\"PR 211-2\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): description of tooling introduced\n\n<img src={image21} alt=\"Image\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): example images of tooling introduced\n\nThe pull request was quite well-recieved:\n\n<img src={comment} alt=\"Comment\"/>\n\n[Comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-554181763) by Layer5 team lead on pull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238)\n\nAs I mentioned in a recent Layer5 community meeting, I am very excited to continue working with Layer5;

Implementing the specified sorting functionalities (for the three tables on the [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape))\n2. Restyling the font color of site hyperlinks (an enhancement [requested later on](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65#issuecomment-483912458) in the issue)\n\n### The strange case of Jekyll\n\nFortunately, thanks to my previous work with Layer5's website, I was already all set up with an offline development environment. However, going into my first task, I knew very little about Jekyll except how to install it.\n\n_[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)... it's got to be like React or Angular, right? I mean, all I need to do is slap in [sort](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/sort/) and [reverse filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/reverse/) and toggle them onclick, right_...?\n\n_...Wait, what's a \"static site generator\"?_\n\n* * *\n\nAfter discovering what Jekyll and Liquid actually were, I determined that I would have to resort to DOM manipulation to fully accomplish my first task. However, I did succeed in accomplishing the default sorting behaviour by enhancing the Liquid tags being used by several tables.\n\nTo do so, I followed coding style on the issue's previous contributor by encapsulating my work within a new JavaScript file in the project's assets folder: a simple bubble sort function.\n\nI chose to implement the [simplest of sorting algorithms](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js#L13) in JavaScript (which I count as study for my _Data Structures and Algorithms_ midterm):\n\n\n```js\n// Excerpted from https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js\nlet bubbleSort = () => {\n  for (i = 0; i < rows.length-1; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j < rows.length-i-1; j++) {\n      if (shouldSwap(text(j), text(j+1))) {\n        rows[j].parentNode.insertBefore(rows[j+1], rows[j]);\n        didSort = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Painting over Pumpkin Bread\n\n[Encycolorpedia.com](https://encycolorpedia.com) lists the hex color code `#fdac40` as \"[Valspar Paint Pumpkin Bread](https://encycolorpedia.com/fdac40)\". Although Layer5.io's then-difficult-to-read hyperlinks were colored `#ffa_b_40`, I'd still like to think that the second task of my second Hacktoberfest contribution was festively-themed!\n\nIn [my last blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/), I mentioned that [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com) was worth further research. Well, after some poking around, I discovered that all of Layer5.io's pumpkin-colored hyperlink styling (both deliberate, and incidental) originated from its materialize.css asset.\n\nAlthough this asset has been [frequently modified](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commits/master/assets/css/materialize.css), I was still hesitant to globally alter the site's styling (in case a return to Pumpkin Bread was desired in the future), so I instead opted to [add a new inline style tag](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209/files#diff-48443fc170100677376b7ee11324494b) to override [a styling rule](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L5149) (on top of removing the 'orange-text' class from individual anchor elements).\n\n* * *\n\nAll of the changes I've made can be viewed through [my (merged) pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209):\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request [layer5io#209](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209): resolved the remainder of issue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)\n\n* * *\n\nI am very fortunate to be so well-supported by the open source communities I have worked with so far, both on-campus and abroad. With their support behind me, I feel equipped to start learning what I need to know to resolve the next two more-difficult issues that lie ahead of me!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: Heating up!","subtitle":null,"date":"October 12th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/90996/hacktoberfestw2.webp 750w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/f5ef2/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1080w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1e91f/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1366w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1918w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5291970802919708}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/eff4c/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/c7d54/hacktoberfestw2.webp 125w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/cd25a/hacktoberfestw2.webp 250w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/eff4c/hacktoberfestw2.webp 500w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/0feda/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":265}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/hacktoberfest-2019-heating-up"}},{"id":"172f6ae5-8002-5100-a4f7-cba43f99c1be","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIn [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/), I identified three GitHub issues to kick off my participation in Hacktoberfest 2019. Today, I am happy to showcase my resolution of one of those issues, marking my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution!\n\n* * *\n\n#### [Layer5.io](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5)\n\nBefore I continue on, I want to acknowledge the project that I have contributed to. In [an article](/programs/gsod) discussing their participating in the Google Summer of Code 2019 program, [**Layer5**](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5)'s open source community is described cloud native tools for devops engineers. My project was on [service mesh](/resources/service-mesh/service-mesh-fundamentals) helpfully defines a service mesh as \"a dedicated infrastructure layer\" of an application that controls how different parts of that application (\"services\") share data with one another (i.e. 'mesh together').\n\n* * *\n\n### Selecting my first Hacktoberfest issue\n\nAs I mentioned my last post, I came into contact with Layer5 after discovering (through the [Hacktoberfest Issue Finder](https://hacktoberfest-finder.netlify.com/)) its [issue regarding table filtering](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)—and subsequently discovered an unreported styling issue. [![A styling issue with a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's Landscape page.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)\n\nA styling issue affected a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nOf the three GitHub issues I've scoped out, the resolution of this styling issue (i.e. tweaking CSS) represents the simplest of tasks that I have lined up—and an ideal candidate for a first-time Hacktoberfest contribution!\n\nAs far as I could tell, no open issues concerned the styling problem that I discovered. So, as instructed both Layer5's website (and encouraged its extremely-welcoming development team), I opened _my own issue_ - [Enhance landscape categories section wrapping (#191)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191).\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)\n\n### Identifying a solution\n\nTo address this issue, I came up with the idea of realigning the category list items horizontally, transforming the poorly-behaving columns of category 'cards' into rows in a responsive and easily-scalable vertical stack.\n\nImplementating this idea proved quite simple, requiring only [a few added CSS rules](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508), which I first accomplished by tinkering with the live webpage's styling (with the help of the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) browser extension):\n\n\n```css\n.card .card-content li {\n  float: right;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n.card .card-content {\n  border-right: unset;\n  padding: 0 0 5px 0;\n}\n.card .card-content:not(:last-child) {\n  border-bottom-width: 1px;\n  border-bottom-style: dashed;\n  border-bottom-color: var(--main-dark-grey);\n}\n```\n\nThe vertical stack is implemented by the rules in the first selector: list items are floated right and assigned a fixed width, which aligns them neatly. The dashed borders and padding used to separate category lists was also adjusted to accomodate the new design (pictured below):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)\n\nThe above image is one of the [two mockups of the redesign](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508) that I produced for the consideration of the project's developers. As luck would have it, Layer5 project lead [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote) provided [a lightning-quick response](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179), welcoming a pull request to it!\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)\n\n#### Future research area: Materialize CSS\n\nI discovered that the 'cards' comprising the category section are styled using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/). I considered using this framework in my solution, but ultimately decided to opt for a simple, intuitive solution. This framework appears interesting, and would definitely merits research were this a more-involved styling task.\n\n## Implementing the solution\n\nWhile using my browser's developer tools to tinker with styling, I discovered an inline `style` tag that serviced the categories section. I determined that this tag would present the best place to add the styling rules that I wrote (following the coding style of a prior contributor).\n\nFinding the location of this `style` tag (i.e. of the \"Service Mesh Landscape\" page) in the source code was a lot more trouble than I thought it would be. After paging through too many HTML documents, I gave in and used Visual Studio's global search functionality to locate it.\n\n## Testing the solution\n\nAlthough I knew that my styling worked well when loaded from a browser extension, before I could contribute code, I needed to ensure that the styling worked equally-well when loaded inline from an HTML document. Little did I know, at that time, what I would be getting myself into...\n\n#### Ruby, Gems and Jekyll? `rvm`, `bundle` and `make`?\n\nPicking through my ~/.bash\\_history file, here is the sequence of Bash shell commands that I issued (via WSL Ubuntu) in order to execute a local copy of the layer5 website (annotated for your convenience):\n```sh\n## Install dependency packages ##\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\n## Install specific version of Ruby via Ruby Version Manager ##\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rvm\nrvm install \"ruby-2.6.3\" # install specific version of Ruby specified in Layer5's Gemfile\n                         # (Yes, it must be that exact version.)\n\n## Configure RubyGems ##\necho 'export GEM\\_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n## Install Jekyll and dependencies ##\ngem install jekyll bundler\nbundle install           # install dependencies listed in Gemfile\n\n## Execute project! ##\nmake site                # references Layer5's Makefile\n                         # alias for \"bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload\"\n```\n#### Stray thoughts on documentation\n\nReflecting back on the process, a question has stuck with me: how much should projects hold the hands of novice contributors? Setting up the means to run `make site` is not included within Layer5's [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). As such, for the most novice of contributors, like myself (who have never even heard of `make` before), setting up the prerequisite development environment presented a lengthy and piecemeal (albeit ultimately valuable) learning experience.\n\nHow much documentation is too little? Too much? How high should the bar be set for contribution? I suppose it is up to the project's community to decide upon the answers to these questions themselves (and write documentation, accordingly).\n\n## Creating a pull request\n\nAfter successfully testing and fixing the styling on my local fork, I created [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request – [Restyle landscape categories (#192)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192)\n\n...and it got merged! First Hacktoberfest contribution, completed!\n\n## Up next!\n\nI ended [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) by stating that I have yet to gain any experience with makefiles. Well, thanks to my work on Layer5, that is no longer true: I have since used a makefile (to launch a Jekyll executable)! This experience will undoubtedly save me some time with resolving [the Comcast issue I found](https://github.com/Comcast/RestfulHttpsProxy/issues/5)! However, the next Hacktoberfest issue I resolve will be [_the first one I blogged about_](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65).\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: documenting my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution","subtitle":null,"date":"October 2nd, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/25655/hacktoberfest.webp 750w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/d8caf/hacktoberfest.webp 1080w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/bbff9/hacktoberfest.webp 1366w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp 1894w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4736008447729672}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/6c533/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/8874d/hacktoberfest.webp 125w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/1db53/hacktoberfest.webp 250w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/6c533/hacktoberfest.webp 500w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/8e0b0/hacktoberfest.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":237}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution"}},{"id":"cac9ddb8-17d6-5815-b6a0-3a849328003b","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport wsldockerstart from \"./wsl-docker-start.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanalogin from \"./wsl-grafana-login.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanaloginsuccess from \"./wsl-grafana-login-success.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanastart from \"./wsl-grafana-start.webp\";\nimport wslk3dstart from \"./wsl-k3d-start.webp\";\nimport wslmesherycomplete from \"./wsl-meshery-complete.webp\";\nimport wslmesherylogin from \"./wsl-meshery-login.webp\";\nimport wslmesheryloginsuccess from \"./wsl-meshery-login-success.webp\";\nimport wslmesherystart from \"./wsl-meshery-start.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nDuring KubeCon EU 2019, I had the chance to discover two new softwares that simply amazed me:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), which is the multi-cluster Kubernetes management plane.\n2. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d), which is used to create a dockerized [k3s](https://k3s.io) server.\n\nAnd, what really appealed to me about both of them is that everything from the installation to the usage was just *simple!*\nAnd cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.\n\n<h4>Environment Setup</h4>\n\nBefore we start having *real* fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery)\n2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n    - Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is also mandatory.\n3. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)\n    - k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.\n4. [WSL2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)\n    - For the (few) ones who know me, my \"OS base\" is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) *(optional)*\n    - Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.\n\n<h4> Nothing is taken for granted </h4>\n\nFor the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won't explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.\n\nThat said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no \"just have to ...\" or \"by simply doing ...\".\n\nIf you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nunixtech) or on the [Layer5 Slack channel](http://slack.layer5.io).\n\n<h4>Meshery Installation</h4>\n\nFor the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:\n\n- Start docker and confirm it's running:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\ndocker version\n```\n\n- Using Docker, install Meshery on your local machine by running the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n<a href={wsldockerstart}>\n    <img src={wsldockerstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wsl-docker-start\" />\n</a>\n\n- Create a new k3d cluster with the <code> WSL2 IP </code>\n\n```bash\nexport mainIP=`hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'`\nk3d list\nk3d create --workers 3 --api-port ${mainIP}:6443\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\nkubectl cluster-info\n```\n\n<a href={wslk3dstart}>\n    <img src={wslk3dstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslk3dstart\" />\n</a>\n<br/>\n- Start Meshery on the newly created cluster\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl system start\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherystart}>\n    <img src={wslmesherystart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherystart\" />\n</a>\n- Once Meshery is fully started, login in your preferred browser using the <code>WSL2 IP</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>\n\n```bash\nexport BROWSER=/mnt/c/Firefox/firefox.exe\n$BROWSER $mainIP:9081 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherylogin}>\n        <img src={wslmesherylogin} alt=\"wslmesherylogin\" />\n</a>\n<a href={wslmesheryloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslmesheryloginsuccess} alt=\"wslmesheryloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### [Optional] More analytics with Grafana\nAs stated above, Meshery can leverage the analytics provided by Grafana. For this blog post, as everything is built from scratch. Here is the setup for a new Grafana dockerized instance.\n\nStart a new Grafana on docker instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-d \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--name=grafana \\\n-e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://$mainIP\" \\\n-e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=MesheryInstance\" \\\ngrafana/grafana\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanastart}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanastart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanastart\" />\n</a>\n\n- Access the new instance with the admin password that you set in the docker environment variable\n```bash\n$BROWSER $mainIP:3000 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanalogin}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanalogin} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanalogin\" />\n</a>\n<br />\n<a href={wslgrafanaloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanaloginsuccess} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanaloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n### An inside look\nWhile everything should run fine, it's always good to have a look at what has been deployed.\n\nIn this case, we are almost exclusively working with Docker and the \"inside look\" should look something like this:\n\n<a href={wslmesherycomplete}>\n    <img src={wslmesherycomplete} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherycomplete\" />\n</a>\n\n#### Conclusion\nAs [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery > k3s (deployed via k3d) > Docker > WSL2 > Windows 10. And he's totally right, still the \"beauty\" here, is that it \"simply works\".\n\nSince the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.\nEven Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.\n\nAnd of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different Kubernetes configurations. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the \"Bonuses\", more fun to come!\n\n<span> > > > <i>Nunix out</i></span>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d","subtitle":"","date":"July 9th, 2019","author":"Nuno do Carmo","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/d8057/cnab-logo.webp 100w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/2e34e/cnab-logo.webp 200w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/getting-started-with-meshery-wsl2-and-k3d"}},{"id":"3d929043-2c98-594d-b3bd-aa895814878f","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style\";\nimport { MeetTheMaintainer } from \"../../MeetTheMaintainer.style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport ForkLift from \"../../../../assets/images/app/hero/forklift.svg\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n  <MeetTheMaintainer>\n\n    <div className=\"intro\">\n      Continuing in our Meet the Maintainer series, we have <Link to=\"/community/members/xin-huang\">Xin Huang</Link>. Xin is a maintainer of the <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Cloud Native Performance</Link> project. In this interview, we get to know Xin a little better and learn about his journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Xin, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Xin is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      I’m working around Service Mesh Acceleration in Intel, and noticed the Service Mesh Performance project. So I attended the community meeting — the community is very active and welcoming and they hope for feedback and contribution from me. It’s the main reason that made me stay here and contribute continuously.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does <Link to=\"/community\">Layer5 community</Link> compare?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Yes, I’ve worked with some open source projects. Layer5 community knows how to cultivate and fulfill the spirit of open source. If you are a newcomer to open source, you can get a big leg up from the Layer5 community.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      What is so fascinating about service meshes? Why are you focused on this technology specifically?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      First, I’m working on Service Mesh Acceleration at Intel. Second, service mesh is a hot area — more and more people and enterprises are trying service mesh in production. Service Mesh is the bridge between developers and infrastructure; how fascinating it is to build something that benefits everyone.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      I’m focusing on the SMP (Service Mesh Performance) project because it’s closely related to my day job. I also use Meshery to manage our service mesh environment and demonstrate our acceleration efforts. Every project has its own specific goal — I can’t say which one is the “best”.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      What is your favorite Meshery CLI command?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Having worked on and used Meshery’s performance characterization features, I’m biased — I like `mesheryctl perf` the most.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Where do you see Cloud Native Performance, Nighthawk, and Meshery heading?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Meshery has a great vision: to manage **all** cloud and cloud-native technologies. It’s a fantastic idea for infrastructure and platform engineers who are overwhelmed by the explosion of projects.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Do you have any hot tip for working with Service Mesh Performance, Nighthawk, or Meshery that others may not know?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      A very powerful feature is coming: Meshery will externalize <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> as a first-class load generator with full lifecycle management. Nighthawk already supports adaptive load control, and with its plugin system we can feed custom metrics back into Meshery. In the future Meshery will even be able to auto-tune resiliency policies based on performance results. This amount of closed-loop intelligence is extremely exciting.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or even maintainers one day?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Be consistent, take ownership (even of boring tasks), help newcomers, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. The current maintainers have all earned their role through dedication — learn from them and respect their time. High-quality contributions, no matter the size, are what matter most.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      In other words, aim for quality over quantity and enjoy the ride!\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Exactly. And never forget to have fun while learning and collaborating with this incredibly diverse community.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"note\">\n      <img src={ForkLift} style={{ height: \"100px\", marginBottom: \"1rem\" }} alt=\"Forklift\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like Xin.  \n      **Be like Xin.** Join the <a

And Layer5 is joining forces with other open source organizations to make it an unforgettable experience. \nOpenForce 2022 is a place where contributors can meet mentors from open source organizations and contribute to projects under guidance, network with project maintainers, and “bring the open source culture” with great enthusiasm.\n<h2 id=\"tasks\">What Layer5 will do?</h2>\nDuring the program, Layer5 as an open source organization will provide OpenForce specific issues which participants can resolve during the contribution period. In addition, there will be a panel of mentors assigned to assist contributors to overcome any challenges they might face.\nBeyond the direct support offered by Layer5 mentors, program participants will have an amazing networking opportunity to connect with the broader set of community members at Layer5. This event will kick-off virtually from March 3rd to March 28th, 2022.\n<h2 id=\"codeflow\">CodeFlow</h2>\nThe program is organized by CodeFlow, an organization whose main motive is to empower the student community by organizing webinars, hackathons, and open source events, providing them with the best learning environment and helping them gain the principal knowledge about the fast-paced, open source ecosystem. What a great learning opportunity this would prove to be as ‘open source meets its contributor force’ at OpenForce 2022! Come be a part of this amazing initiative.\nLayer5 is an amazing and welcoming community.\n</BlogWrapper>\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Layer5 collaboration with OpenForce 2022","subtitle":null,"date":"February 25th, 2022","author":"Shebeul Inyang","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/thumbnail.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACwBACdASoUABQAPtFepU6oJSMiKAqpABoJZQC90BETRQH39UlzoIRNS23UcAAAAP7boz7uKtrrTcFLS2nfqbmEZHvEvAdI8emJ2/MhnXSD6J7c2NQO9Rp23NfX85nycaVQ8FDFE0jV4Z7WM1IORAA/O7AAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/2967e/thumbnail.webp","srcSet":"/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/1e18d/thumbnail.webp 750w,\n/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/2967e/thumbnail.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9962962962962963}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/thumbnail.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACwBACdASoUABQAPtFepU6oJSMiKAqpABoJZQC90BETRQH39UlzoIRNS23UcAAAAP7boz7uKtrrTcFLS2nfqbmEZHvEvAdI8emJ2/MhnXSD6J7c2NQO9Rp23NfX85nycaVQ8FDFE0jV4Z7WM1IORAA/O7AAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/909bc/thumbnail.webp","srcSet":"/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/d66e1/thumbnail.webp 125w,\n/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/87777/thumbnail.webp 250w,\n/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/909bc/thumbnail.webp 500w,\n/static/8356829f39927118284053db92eae3dd/8326c/thumbnail.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":498}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/layer5-collaboration-with-openforce-2022"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Community"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1485533831","4047814605","408154852","4152005505"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/blog/tag/community"}
