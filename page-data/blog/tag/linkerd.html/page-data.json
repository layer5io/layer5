Microservice architectures brought on as many challenges as they have advantages. With operational complexity being one of the most acute pains. Service meshes do offer solutions to a number of these operational concerns. Including but not limited to: resilience, improved observability, security and advanced service discovery.\n\n<div>\n<iframe width=\"100%\" alt=\"Deploying Linkerd with Meshery\" title=\"Deploying Linkerd with Meshery\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXQV-i-Hkf8\" allowFullScreen loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" style={{minHeight: \"315px\", minWidth: \"280px\"}}></iframe>\n</div>\n\nBut with so many mesh options around - how do we choose, evaluate and compare them? And once we’ve chosen a solution - how do we make it accessible to all our engineers? It is to provide an answer to these questions that the Layer5 community has created <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, the open-source, service mesh management plane. Meshery already supports a number of leading mesh providers with adapters for additional meshes on the way. In today’s video, I’ll show how to use Meshery for rolling out and evaluating Linkerd.\n\n Linkerd is a system that comes from the service mesh pioneers - the company called Buoyant. They were the first to realise the need for a distributed network of smart, centrally configured proxies and coin the term “service mesh” back in 2016. Today, we’ll be looking at Linkerd 2.x - the second generation of this now CNCF project.\n\n<h5>Meshery Adapters</h5>\n\n<table className=\"table-adapters\">\n    <thead className=\"hidden\">\n        <th>Status</th>\n        <th>Adapter</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"7\" className=\"stable-adapters\">stable</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-istio\"><img src={istio} alt='Istio Service Mesh adapter' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Istio</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-linkerd\"><img src={linkerd} alt='Linkerd' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Linkerd</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-consul\"><img src={consul} alt='Consul Connect' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Consul</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-octarine\"><img src={octarine} alt='Octarine Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Octarine</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-nsm\"><img src={nsm} alt='Network Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Network Service Mesh</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td className=\"stable-adapters\"></td></tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"2\" className=\"beta-adapters\">beta</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx\">\nMeshery adapter for Citrix CPX</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td className=\"beta-adapters\"></td></tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"6\" className=\"alpha-adapters\">alpha</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-maesh\"><img src={maesh} alt='Maesh Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Maesh</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-app-mesh\"><img src={awsappmesh} alt='AWS App Mesh Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for App Mesh </a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-kuma\"><img src={kuma} alt='Kuma Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Kuma</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td></td></tr>\n    <tr><td className=\"alpha-adapters\"></td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nSome things that Linkerd is known for:\n\n- Purpose-built for Kubernetes\n- Featuring custom-built, highly performant proxies written in Rust\n- Zero-config option (works out-of-the-box)\n- Network telemetry built-in (includes a pre-configured, optimised Prometheus instance)\n- Low-overhead control-plane\n- Operational simplicity (when compared to Istio, for example, even though Istio is getting better in this regard)\n\nSo what is covered in the video? More or less the following:\n\n- What service mesh tech allows us to do\n- What a typical service mesh architecture looks like\n- What Layer5 is about (<i>Lookout - it may surprise you!</i>)\n- What Meshery is. What Linkerd is.\n- How easy it is to install Meshery on your PC (be it Linux, Mac or Windows)\n- All it takes is:\n```sh\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n- How Meshery connects to your Kubernetes cluster (nothing to be done if it’s in your <code>kubectl config current-context</code>)\n- How to correctly install and remove Linkerd on your Kubernetes cluster using Meshery\n- How to install one of included Linkerd sample applications and verify the installation\n\nThat’s quite a lot of content for a 20 minute clip. In the follow-up videos, we’ll dive deeper into many of these concepts. And also show how to use Meshery with other service mesh providers.\n\nThis video is also the opening shot of Layer5's [Learn to Service Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A-A6hPO2IN_HSU0pSfijBboiHggs5mC) playlist, which is specifically dedicated to tutorials and webinars.
