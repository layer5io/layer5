It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed.

This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Henrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable.\\nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic.
