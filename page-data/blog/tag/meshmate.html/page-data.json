Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Yash is and how you arrived at your MeshMate role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Hey Vivek, thanks for having me! One day, I was scrolling through Twitter and saw someone praising the Layer5 community. I was curious, so I checked it out and joined their Slack channel. As a newbie to open-source, I was unsure about many things, but Shivam ( an amazing contributor ), welcomed me and suggested I should attend the Meshery Dev meet to learn more.\"\n      \"I picked up some issues and started working on them but soon hit a wall. Then one day, Lee Calcote messaged me and said he had me on his intern's list, but noticed I wasn't around the community much. So I reached out to Abhishek and Gaurav for help on how to get more involved. They showed me how to contribute and help others, and then I started attending dev calls, helping others, and making new friends.\"\n”After a while, I received a message from Lee and Gaurav saying that I would look good in the MeshMate logo I was surprised. It was one of the best things to happen to me, but also came with a responsibility to help others in the community and guide them on their journey.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a MeshMate and have been for some long time now. What does being a MeshMate mean to you? What does it take to be a successful MeshMate?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Being a MeshMate is not just an honor, it is also a responsibility towards the community. MeshMates are individuals who are committed to help other members of the community. This includes ensuring that community members have access to resources, are introduced to other members, and understand the vision and goals of the projects.”\n      \"I have always loved learning in a community because with a community, we can grow together. Similarly, MeshMates always make sure that their mentees are successful along with the project. It's a great feeling to be a part of a community where everyone is working towards the same goal and supporting each other along the way.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"I remember introducing Meshery and MeshMap in my college event. It was an incredibly successful event, and I take great pride in being a part of a community that supports such innovative projects. The response from the attendees was overwhelming, and I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the contributors who played a pivotal role in making this project a resounding success. Their collective efforts truly deserve admiration and appreciation.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      What is your favorite part of the Layer5 Community? Of being a MeshMate?\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"When I joined Layer5 community I got a welcome message with helping instructions so that I can contribute smoothly and I think this shows how much this community cares about their contributors which I like most about Layer5, everyone here is so welcoming and helping.\"\n      \"Being a MeshMate you get exposure in community which is really good for your growth but this is not best part of being a MeshMate, the best part is the feeling you get after helping someone and being little part of their success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      With the number of people  that join the Layer5 community everyday, how do you deal with the continued influx of newcomers?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Layer5 is big community over 4000+ members on slack and everyday so many people join Layer5 community and connecting with newcomers everyday is really not easy it takes time and your little strength too but as I said earliar, being a MeshMate also comes with responsibility which I enjoy most 😎.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Impressively, you’re also a software engineering intern at Layer5. How did this come to be? What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery and the Layer5 community?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Truelly I never joined Layer5 with mindset of internship after I joined Layer5 I saw here people learning new things as they are working on projects, making growth in their personality and improving engineering skills which is what I actually want. Layer5 offers internships all the time and these internships are offered to those who make impact in community and contribute consistently. After 2 months of making impact and contributing consistently I got mail with offer of internship.\"\n      \"Layer5 is growing everyday and many people started using Meshery, MeshMap and other projects for their businesses with this growth my personal goal is to work start helping projects in field of Devops and backend and also I like learning and sharing in public so I’ll also try to spread word of what we do here to appreciate everyone's effort.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\nNow, I’ve heard of Community Badges, but what are these? How many are there? More importantly, how do I collect the whole set?! 🙂\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Haha the way you are making impact in community soon you’ll get all Vivek, Badges are signs of contributors' efforts in their respective fields given by community. There are different badges for different efforts and I have this which represents MeshMate. I would really like to see you getting so many badges Vivek 😉.\"\n      \"Badges are not also easy to take, this requires your efforts and time towards community and its projects. As I said Layer5 community always wants its contributors' success because with their success it’s layer5's success and badges are one of the ways of recognising contributors' efforts.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re particularly proud of?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"😂 some of my favourite questions, I really like using this 🚀 emoji which represents the feeling of keep doing and keep pushing until it's done. I am mostly a night person, as I feel most productive during that time, although I don't recommend it.\"\n      \"I worked on different projects of Layer5 and I am proud for all of them though my favorite part is getting Meshery and MeshMap support default dark mode so that user will get smooth experience of using Meshery or MeshMap \"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Yes Cloud native ecosystem is so vast and constantly evolving. I think being part of cloud native community helps me stay up-to-date with its fast moving ecosystem and I’ll also suggest everyone to join community from any platform you like Slack, Twitter or your favorite platform \"\n      \"As I said Cloud native is so vast so as it’s community too there are so many updated resources available out their on internet by community, which helps me to keep update with Cloud native ecosystem\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> What  advice do you have for individuals who are hopeful to become Layer5 contributors, interns, or potentially MeshMates?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Try to come out of your comfort zone. If you are reading this conversation, you are already out of your comfort zone, which is a really good step. Who I am today is because I came out of my comfort zone, which I would also prefer. Lastly, be more helpful towards the community and, most importantly, be consistent. I wish you success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\"><img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\"/>The open source community at Layer5 is an award winning program and continues to evolve as it grows in number daily.

At the end of the Contribution boot camp, it was heartwarming to see the mentees were able to make noticeable contributions to the projects.  During the boot camp wrap up call, mentees gave presentations that revealed how impactful it was for them working on Layer5 projects.\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\n    In gratitude, we acknowledge the commitment and contributions of the mentees toward the projects and we won't forget our incredible mentors who were devoted to meeting the needs and answering to the mentees during this bootcamp.

Being fairly new\n    to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to\n    delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm\n    welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation\n    jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the\n    task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings\n    hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I\n    finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!\n    It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\n      Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being\n    a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and\n    GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to\n    expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a\n    continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush\n    Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have\n    spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the\n    project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began\n    helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to\n    do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I\n    recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a\n    MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring\n    positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward\n    to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊\n  <br />\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/kelechi-nwachukwu\">\n      Kelechi Precious Nwachukwu\n    </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Kelechi }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"kelechi-precious\"\n  />\n      It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn't\n    something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I\n    stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of\n    projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa\n    (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.\n      A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you\n    some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I\n    recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and\n    managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my\n    hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous\n    tech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too\n    ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow\n    made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another\n    task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a\n    peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the\n    only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was\n    not.\n      I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would\n    previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different\n    approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was\n    amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have\n    helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an\n    invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I\n    have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly\n    environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may\n    not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having\n    a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing\n    determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\"> Ruth Ikegah </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Ruth }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"ruth-ikegah\"\n  />\n      The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a\n    close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.\n    Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only\n    6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came\n    to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel,\n    after which I visited the <Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io\">GitHub repository</Link> and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.\n      To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.\n      Impressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon\n    began helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading. Experience an open-source community with Layer5 today! Once you’re set up on Slack, do send me a ping to\n    say hi. The exciting part, we might even meet as MeshMates 😉\n  \\- Tanuj, Ruth, and Kelechi\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing a new line of MeshMates","subtitle":null,"date":"September 25th, 2020","author":"Our MeshMates with 🤍","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/5af24/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/a16f1/meshmate-announcement.webp 125w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/fcddb/meshmate-announcement.webp 250w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/5af24/meshmate-announcement.webp 500w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/87c93/meshmate-announcement.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":337}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-a-new-line-of-meshmates"}},{"id":"bd19c992-298c-515b-b2d6-0288d77ab971","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport SignedBook from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nGetting involved in something new and essentially avant garde, can be a messy challenge to navigate through. But, when it comes to contributing to Meshery it only gets more and more meshy!\n\n### Get set go!\n\nI was introduced to the world of open source through the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a> project in the august of 2019 and have since then been continuously exploring the farthest reaches of Meshery, Layer5, the parent SMI project and consecutively the CNCF landscape.\nAt the time of writing this, I have been a part of the Meshery project for about a year. Fascinated by the concept and further lured in by the welcoming community at Layer5, I was soon dipping my toes into the tidal wave of code. Starting out with small contributions to improve the UI, I stumbled on to my first issue, which was to open a page in a new tab instead of opening it in the same tab. Basic, right?\n\nI’m pointing this out to unravel the myth and smoke clouds around open source projects. Contributing can be as easy as altering a few lines of code and can be as meaningful as writing a whole new feature adapter. Since then, I have crossed small and big hurdles, meandering through countless issues and have become a part of the wholesome community, gaining friends and mentors along the way.\n\n### Stepping stones\n\nLet’s begin with the basics. What is Layer5?\n\nAt Layer5, we champion developer-defined infrastructure, giving engineers the power to reshape application delivery. We empower operators in reimagining how they manage modern infrastructure: collaboratively.\n\n### Roadblocks\n\nComing to my contributions at Layer5, I have mostly been involved in improving the UI and shaping the company site’s present outlook. I have also tried my hand at other projects, including the `mesheryctl` and the `landscape` at Layer5. In fact, here is a comprehensive list of **[my contributions across Layer5 projects](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+author%3ANikhil-Ladha+org%3Alayer5io)**.\n\nThe above mentioned links are just the **visible** contributions made by me. With time, I have grown and was soon approached to become a [MeshMate](/community/meshmates), an initiative which involves few seasoned contributors like me who will hold the hand of a new member and help him/her bridge the gap and take the leap into open source.\n\n### Tricks of the Trade\n\nThe benefits of being a UI engineer?\n\nWeb developers are required in every company in one meaningful way or the other as every single project needs a frontend to showcase it’s capabilities to the user. Coming to Layer5, the frontend of Meshery is built on React( another masterpiece from Facebook! ), which I learned from scratch when I joined the community.\n\n<img src={SignedBook} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"Nikhil-ladha-work\" />\n\nNow, months have passed and with some healthy dedication and hours of staring at thousands of lines of code, I have a good base and practical experience with React, something which you can’t hope to gain from personal projects and require a community for.\n\nThe Layer5 and Meshery websites are built using Jekyll, another technology about which I didn’t have any practical knowledge a couple of months ago. Easier than react and harder than CSS, Jekyll is perfect for the aspiring web developers out there and is also another reason for you to pop over to the Layer5 repo after reading this article.\n\n### Meshy goodness<br/>\n\nMy experience at Layer5 has made me proud of the work that we do and has challenged me time and again to reach for higher goals. I still have a hunch that someway or the other my contributions are responsible for getting me an internship at Red Hat! All heads bowed to [Lee Calcote](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote/) for his presence and guidance and to the Layer5 community for being as amazing as it is. My journey at Layer5 has been an ever growing curve to be honest from just a contributor to a MeshMate to the maintainer of few projects at Layer5. And, true to god this wouldn’t have been possible without the combined effort from me and our very own Lee Calcote. His trust and confidence in me is what encourages me to contribute more and more at Layer5 and see it grow to some next level in the coming future.\nMotivated or moved or still confused?\n\nWant to experience the same feeling and see yourself recognized as an Open-source contributor?\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My journey from a contributor to a maintainer!","subtitle":"","date":"August 11th, 2020","author":"Nikhil Ladha","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/5f169/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/d66e1/pic1.webp 125w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/e7160/pic1.webp 250w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/5f169/pic1.webp 500w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/3cd29/pic1.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-journey-from-a-contributor-to-a-maintainer"}},{"id":"a45a606d-6f4a-5ecd-883a-d61a271c015d","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nI started a new job at [RemoteState](https://www.linkedin.com/company/remotestate/) as a software development engineer in May of 2020.\nPost the initial plunge, settling into the role was relatively easier for me due to the experience I had gained in working on open source contributions in the Layer5 community. My experience with open source had also been a big plus for me throughout the application and interview process. As a direct result, my colleagues and seniors became genuinely inquisitive about Meshery and its functionality as the Kubernetes Manager. So when asked, I happily agreed  to deliver a session on the subject to the entire team.\n\nI pitched my idea to [Lee Calcote](https://layer5.io/community/members/lee-calcote) and in his usual supportive form, he was as excited as I was about the session. A brainstorm session led to creating an entire presentation with suggestions from Lee. The Layer5 community offers a number of resources to contributors, including these two decks ([Meshery - the cloud native management plane](https://layer5.io/meshery) and [Layer5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tLcMcyQ-Z6YYISYyR0Eyb30dojQiKHIjs7Rt5m8kcag/edit?usp=sharing) that I drew from as a basis for a personalized presentation and demonstration to my new team.\n\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQNpnp_SIkYNMe1rx-Cw_armxHRmQvkcp8d3BVML6XEhsSgy7k0w9xDKrGGs4EPew/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowfullscreen={true} mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></center>\n\nWhen the day arrived to present the concepts of cloud native infrastructure, Meshery, and other cloud native initiatives to my team, I held a Google Meet with a full attendance. I started the session with a reader’s digest version of microservices and cloud native infrastructure to set the stage for any newcomers to the world of cloud native, I went on to elaborate on Layer5 ‘s contributions to the CNCF landscape and the SMI project. This was followed by an in-depth discussion on data planes, control planes, and management planes. I spoke at-length about Meshery’s functionality including, its features for facilitating the benchmarking, interoperability and standardization of cloud native infrastructure. I wrapped up the session with some insider tips that I have learned in my months as an open source contributor in the Layer5 community. In the stream of feedback received from my colleagues, the session seems to have been a success.\n\nThis whole experience has been an amazing journey for me. From being a complete noob to utilizing my expertise in the cloud native infrastructure domain to landing an actual job, the experience has been a maze of ups and downs. But, I feel like I have finally arrived and arrived with a pot of gold. I’m eternally grateful to Lee Calcote for motivating me and providing me with the appropriate resources. Entering and exploring an open source community can be a daunting task and the [resources provided by Layer5](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) helped them in overcoming that challenge and enabled them to learn more about the widespread work of [Meshery](https://meshery.io).\n\nI’m glad to have found a community that not only feeds my professional success, but also my personal growth. It’s not out of obligation, but out of a sense of gratitude and paying it forward to others (a tenant of the Layer5 community) that I now spend much of my time as a MeshMate. I help welcome and guide other new contributors along their open source path as they learn and grow. Giving to others and while continuing to grow professionally and personally is time well spent.   I encourage you to join me and others in the Layer5 community by jumping into our [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/) to start meshing around!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How I schooled my seniors","subtitle":"and why I swear by the experience","date":"August 4th, 2020","author":"Nupur Thakur","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/15f20/feature-image.webp 750w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/9a568/feature-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp 1188w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6691919191919192}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/d03f3/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/a16f1/feature-image.webp 125w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/48571/feature-image.webp 250w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/d03f3/feature-image.webp 500w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/976f0/feature-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":335}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/how-i-schooled-my-seniors"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"MeshMate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1485533831","4047814605","408154852","4152005505"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/blog/tag/meshmate"}
