I used to find it fascinating how computer programs operate because they have such a tremendous impact on their users. This has always motivated me to work in the field of computers.\n\nAs I grew up, I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more. I started exploring and made projects. The more I understood them, the more interesting they got. Slowly I realized that I don’t want to make projects that satisfy just my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open source projects. \n\n### First PR at Layer5 \nI still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I spotted a <code>[good first issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)</code> tag and expressed interest in working on it despite not knowing what the task was. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions, something I was unaware of at the time. After getting the issue assigned, I started researching what GitHub Actions were. I found out that these actions helped automate workflows to build, test, and deploy software. After getting the basics down, I checked if there were any existing GitHub Actions for the auto labeling of the PR. To my surprise, there were a couple of them. \n\nSo before actually making a PR, I experimented with the actions extensively in my private repo. I remember making about 20-25 PR in my private repo to get the auto labeler working fine. After verifying that I got the desired results, I made a PR. I also got to discuss my approach in the [Meshery Development Call](https://layer5.io/community/calendar). I was so nervous at that time since that was the first meeting I attended where I had to make people understand what I did and the strategies I used. I was quite thrilled when my code got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions. \n\n<img src={aadityaFirstPr} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya's first PR merged\" />\n\n### A Journey Never to forget \n\nMy Layer5 journey began with this small issue. I gradually started learning more about the projects and made some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned new technologies and techniques. Contributing to the codebase gave me so much exposure to React.js, which would not have been possible if I had done it on my own. I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time, I was comfortable with it. I am thankful that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing. I have always applied this principle, learning more by doing actual stuff rather than sitting there and getting stuck in the tutorial loop. \n\nAnother new technology I discovered was Jekyll, a static site generator. I was unfamiliar with this technology as well. I started contributing to issues involving Jekyll and slowly understood the basics and how the language works. I was very happy that I was able to make the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.meshery.io/project/compatibility-matrix), using Jekyll. Even my project for <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">GSoC</Link> is written in Jekyll. So, going from not knowing what Jekyll is, to making some big changes, did make me happy.  \n\nThe community also helped me boost my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meetings required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me get vocal and comfortable with talking to various people. \n\n<img src={aadityaPresenting} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya Presenting\" /> \n\nI am excited to be accepted as a <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</Link> Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. The project assigned to me is to create a dashboard on <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/dashboard\">SMP Website</a>. Results from the [CNCF Cluster labs](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/actions) will be displayed here graphically.  I wish to learn more about cloud native technologies and make contributions on the backend too. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can. \n\n### Appreciation for the Community \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Layer5 Community for always being so supportive whenever I needed it. I took away a very significant lesson from this experience, there is always something to learn, and there is no harm in asking questions if you don't know the answer. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community. There was not a day that I felt completely lost here, and that is what I adore about this community.\n\nKeep Meshing. Thank you.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Journey as a Contributor to GSoC Intern at Layer5","subtitle":"Nothing but a magical experience","date":"July 6th, 2022","author":"Aaditya Narayan Subedy","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/b2bde/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7b988/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 125w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/f2ef5/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 250w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/b2bde/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 500w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/dcb7d/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":226}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/my-journey-as-a-contributor-to-gsoc-intern-at-layer5"}},{"id":"41e991fb-eaeb-55d4-be96-3a0e20e3329f","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\nimport gsocLogo from \"./gsoc.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<img src={gsocLogo} className=\"gsoc-image\" align=\"right\" alt=\"gsoc-image\" />\n  Hi, I am Piyush Singariya, a short description of me would be “another\n  software engineer watching anime”, in the longer version I am a 2021 graduate\n  from IIT Roorkee, who loves to watch anime and play video games all day.

Before being accepted as a Google Summer of Code intern, I had been working with the Layer5 community as an active contributor, exploring various new DevOps tooling like service meshes, the sidecar concept, and performance benchmarking of services. I have had a run-in with the Kubernetes community before and initially believed Kubernetes to be the final stage of DevOps, but I was happily surprised when I found out that the end of Kubernetes merely marked the entrypoint to a whole new world of service meshes.\nAnd so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2020 internship, which began on the night of May 3rd, 2020 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Admittedly, I had tried my best an year ago to get into GSoC’19 with another organisation but due to reasons only Google can tell you, I was not accepted. Everything happens for a reason though, right?\nSix months ago, if you would have told me that I would be working with service meshes, gRPC, load testing, performance benchmarking alongside prominent members of the open source world of Cloud Native, I would have ignored you with the least possible amount of prudence I could muster.\n<h4>What is my project about?</h4>\nMy GSoC project is to <strong>Enable Distributed Load Testing for various Service Mesh Planes using Envoy Nighthawk</strong>. For those who are not familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a>, it is a performance benchmark tool written and maintained by the Envoy community. We are in the process of incorporating Nighthawk into <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> - <i>the cloud native management plane</i>.Meshery already supports performance testing of service meshes using fortio & wrk2 and is maintained by the Layer5 community and is also a member of CNCF Landscape. Alongside this effort, we are creating a new industry standard: <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance Specification</Link> which is another initiative of the Layer5 community to establish a common format for describing and capturing service mesh performance.\nIt has  been a month since I have started my GSoC’20 tenure with the Layer5 community, and in this month, I have learned a lot from my code contributions and mentor. I began with setting up the project roadmap and discussing the potential use cases of Nighthawk with its maintainers during my community bonding period. I came to know some incredible people during the community bonding from big tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Affirmed Networks, Red Hat and many more to list. Before incorporating Nighthawk, we had to make various enhancements in Meshery, like adding user preferences for performance settings, specifying the SMPS format for exporting and importing of load-test preferences, load-generator interface and more.\nI have learned a hoard of new things, like gRPC services and how they communicate using protocol buffers, load generation using fortio, writing handlers for various endpoints using golang, and some frontend architecture with Nextjs.\n<h4>About the community</h4>\nLayer5 has one of the healthiest open source communities that I have ever worked with. In the past, I have worked with a variety of well-maintained and large scale open source communities but I have never experienced a more welcoming and nurturing environment than Layer5. At Layer5, we respect each contributor and their contributions, whether it is a new adapter or just a typo fix. If you can contribute, please do. It’s that simple! With many awesome initiatives like SMPS, Distributed Load Testing, Performance Benchmarking, Learn Layer5, and Image Hub, the exponential increase of Layer5 and its various projects is inevitable.\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Summer of Code 2020: Service Mesh Performance with Envoy Nighthawk","subtitle":"One of the greatest learning experiences yet.","date":"June 23rd, 2020","author":"Kush Trivedi","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/d1572/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/16e88/gsoc-wide.webp 125w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/f1e1b/gsoc-wide.webp 250w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/d1572/gsoc-wide.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":297}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/google-summer-of-code-2020-service-mesh-performance-with-envoy-nighthawk"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"GSoC"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1485533831","4047814605","408154852","4152005505"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/blog/tag/gsoc"}
