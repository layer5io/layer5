A robust management plane allows you to take full advantage of the power of the network while integrating your service delivery processes seamlessly. Your management plane might federate different types of infrastructure, help you instigate chaos through controlled experiments, or offer automated traffic splitting in order to execute different styles of canarying of your applications. Your management plane might offer deep insights into the performance of your applications and to the performance of your infrastructure or might deliver a change in management framework.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, mdx(\"img\", {\n    src: MesheryLogo,\n    align: \"center\",\n    alt: \"meshery-logo\",\n    height: \"35rem\",\n    width: \"35rem\",\n    style: {\n      \"paddingBottom\": \"5px\",\n      \"paddingTop\": \"auto\"\n    }\n  }), \" \", \"Meshery\"), mdx(\"img\", {\n    src: MeshManager,\n    className: \"slides-left\",\n    align: \"right\",\n    alt: \"mesh-manager\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, mdx(Link, {\n    to: \"/cloud-native-management/meshery\",\n    mdxType: \"Link\"\n  }, \"Meshery\"), \" manages the lifecycle of infrastructure.
