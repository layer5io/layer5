This week, we're thrilled to announce a groundbreaking collaboration between Layer5 and Intel, bringing you a suite of service mesh management features tailored for WebAssembly-based network traffic management filters in Envoy, the sidecar proxy used in the data plane of Istio. These new features open up a world of possibilities for your service mesh architecture.\n\n<img\n\tsrc=\"https://mcusercontent.com/6b50be5aea3dfe1fd4c041d80/images/c4a4d061-a42d-5373-f789-cc29a21b3d5c.png\"\n\twidth=\"15%\"\n\tstyle={{ margin: \"1rem 1rem 1rem 0rem\" }}\n/>\n\n## Seamless WASM Envoy Filter Management\n\nWith this collaboration, we're introducing powerful features that simplify the management of Envoy WASM filters via Meshery:\n\n### Meshery UI and CLI Integration\n- **Import WASM Envoy Filters**: Easily import your WebAssembly Envoy filters into Meshery using the intuitive UI or the command-line interface ([CLI](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl#data-plane-intelligence)).\n- **Publish and Clone Filters**: Share your filters with the community by publishing them in the [Meshery Catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) and make it effortless for others to clone them.\n- **Download WASM Binaries**: Access and download WebAssembly binaries directly from [Meshery Cloud](https://cloud.layer5.io/).\n- **Efficient Data Plane Design**: Seamlessly design and deploy Istio and Envoy data planes using [MeshMap](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshmap).\n- **Contribute to Open Source**: Get involved with the service mesh community by contributing to any of the 7 open-source [wasm-filters](https://github.com/layer5io/wasm-filters) developed by Layer5.\n\n### Collaboration and Engagement\n- :star2: **Support Your Favorites**: Encourage collaboration by starring your [favorite repository](https://github.com/meshery/meshery) on GitHub.\n- :playground_slide: **Hands-On Experience**: Experience these features firsthand in the [Meshery Playground](https://playground.meshery.io/) by accessing version v0.6.109.\n\n<img\n\tsrc=\"https://mcusercontent.com/6b50be5aea3dfe1fd4c041d80/images/a07ef29a-4cf8-986e-9bd3-78db7dc00ce1.png\"\n\twidth=\"15%\"\n\tstyle={{ margin: \"1rem 1rem 1rem 0rem\" }}\n/>\n\n## Envoy WASM Filter Management\n\nWe've revamped the management of Envoy WASM filters in Meshery with several enhancements:\n\n### Meshery Server Integration\n- ✅ New WASM Filter Component: A new component is available in the Design Configurator to simplify filter management.\n- ✅ Improved Component Icon: Enhancements have been made to provide a more user-friendly experience.\n- ✅ Relationship Patch Policy: A new policy has been introduced to streamline the relationship between components.\n\n### Meshery CLI Command Line\n- ✅ Import Filters: Use `mesheryctl filter import [URL | filepath]` to effortlessly import filters.\n- ✅ Delete Filters: Remove unwanted filters with `mesheryctl filter delete [filter-name | ID]`.\n- ✅ View Filters: Gain insights into your filters using `mesheryctl filter view [filter-name | ID]`.\n- ✅ List and Search Filters: Easily navigate filters with `mesheryctl filter list [filter-name | ID]`.\n\n### MeshMap Integration\n- ✅ Apply WASM Filters: Hierarchically apply filters to your Envoy configurations.\n- ✅ Deploy/Undeploy Filters: Streamline the deployment and removal of filters with custom configurations.\n- ✅ Enhanced Visibility: View filters within a dedicated panel and seamlessly drop them onto the canvas.\n\n<img\n\tsrc=\"https://mcusercontent.com/6b50be5aea3dfe1fd4c041d80/images/1e9c2e71-1b3e-a132-4766-8cefdc9861d2.png\"\n\twidth=\"15%\"\n\tstyle={{ margin: \"1rem 1rem 1rem 0rem\" }}\n/>\n\n### Meshery UI Enhancements\n- ✅ Import Filters: Import filters directly via URL or filesystem.\n- ✅ Improved Browsing: Browse, search, and view filters in both grid view and table view.\n- ✅ Streamlined Lists: Easily list and search filters in grid view or table view.\n- ✅ Download Filters: Download filters effortlessly from the UI.\n\n### Layer5 Cloud and Catalog Integration\n- ✅ Permanent Storage and Artifact Dispersal: Ensure your filters are securely stored and widely accessible.\n- ✅ Catalog Features: Import, clone, download, publish, and unpublish filters within the Meshery Catalog.\n- ✅ Enhanced Privacy Controls: Manage user permissions, team ownership, and visibility for your filters.\n- ✅ Content Curation: Streamline content curation with an approval flow request queue.\n- ✅ On-Premises Deployment: Run Layer5 Cloud on-premises using Docker Compose or Helm Chart.\n\n## Performance Management Upgrades\n\nIn addition to Envoy WASM filter management, we've also introduced new performance management features:\n\n### Meshery Server\n- ✅ Performance Profiles: Tailor your performance profiles to match your specific needs.\n- ✅ SSL Certificate Support: Benefit from SSL certificate support for Fortio in the server.\n- ✅ Performance Analysis Comparison: Compare performance with and without filters.\n- ✅ GetNighthawk and Cloud Native Performance Releases: Access the latest releases of GetNighthawk and Cloud Native Performance.\n\n### Meshery CLI\n- ✅ Performance Profile Flags: Specify additional load generator flags with performance profiles.\n\n### Meshery UI\n- ✅ Performance Profile Flags: Customize load generator flags directly in the UI.\n\n### Cloud Native Performance Project\n- ✅ Define Performance Profiles: Clearly define your performance profiles.\n- ✅ Dashboard Integration: Display test results on the dashboard.\n- ✅ Intel Integration: Incorporate Intel design into scheduled workflows for Istio.\n- ✅ Consolidated Performance Profiles: Streamline performance profiles on the dashboard.\n\n### [MeshMap Snapshot](http://localhost:8000/cloud-native-management/gitops)\n- ✅ GitHub Integrated Screenshots: Capture GitHub-integrated screenshots of deployments.\n\nThis collaboration between Layer5 and Intel marks a significant milestone in service mesh management. These enhancements empower you to take full advantage of WebAssembly-based network traffic management filters in Envoy, bringing a new level of flexibility and control to your Istio deployments.\n\nStay tuned for more exciting updates in the world of service mesh management with Meshery.
