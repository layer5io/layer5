I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming. I learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense.

Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).\"), mdx(\"img\", {\n    src: pic4,\n    alt: \"github-profile\"\n  }), mdx(\"h4\", null, \"What is Meshery?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Meshery is a multi-platform management that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of Kubernetes and cloud platforms and applications.\", mdx(\"br\", null)), mdx(\"img\", {\n    src: pic1,\n    alt: \"meshry\"\n  }), mdx(\"p\", null, \"As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\"), mdx(\"br\", null), \"Meshery seamlessly integrates with every CNCF project, your existing tools, multiple Clouds and Kubernetes clusters.\", mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"img\", {\n    className: \"align-right\",\n    src: pic2,\n    alt: \"Lee Calcote\"\n  }), mdx(\"h4\", null, \"Lee Calcote\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Lee Calcote is an innovative leader and has previously made waves in the tech community as a Docker Captain and a Cloud Native Ambassador and that is just a milestone in his impressive journey, which consists of his admirable work with developer platforms, cloud technology, containers, functions, and applications.
