Five months ago, I was a new contributor with zero knowledge of cloud native technologies roaming through their Github looking to make my first contribution. In this article, I’ll share my journey contributing to Layer5 as a designer. I’ll also share insights I hope new contributors find useful as they navigate their open source journey.\n\n### Discovery\nI first learned about Layer5 through the LFX Mentorship. I stumbled upon a tweet by [Anita Ihuman](/community/members/anita-ihuman) announcing that [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery) was accepting mentees for a design-related project. I had always been looking to make design contributions to open source projects but it was hard finding one. So, this was a great opportunity for me.\n\n### My First Contribution\nInterestingly, my first contribution to Layer5 had nothing to do with design. It was a writing task. They needed a blog that highlighted [the importance of GitHub stars](https://layer5.io/blog/community/on-the-importance-of-github-stars) to a project. The purpose of the blog was to boost the project’s visibility by encouraging more people to [give Meshery a star](https://github.com/meshery/meshery) on GitHub. Since I had some experience writing, I volunteered to write the blog. It was a bit more tasking than I had anticipated but with the help of the community, I was able to work through it.\n \n### Making Design Contributions\nI noticed there were a bunch of open issues to design badges for users and contributors. I requested to work on one of the badges and got assigned. I didn’t initially have edit access to the community Figma file so I struggled to get assets like the logo and font to create the design. I eventually found them in the local branch of Layer5 that I had cloned earlier on my PC. Turned out that all the resources I needed to complete that task were available to me; I just needed to know where to look.\n\nThat was my first design contribution. Since then I’ve designed more badges and contributed in many other ways besides design. For instance, I worked on documentation and helped with marketing and community management.\n\n### How I've Benefited\nHere’s a non-exhaustive summary of how contributing to Layer5 has benefited me:\n1. **Autonomy** - I’ve learned to own my process and see tasks from start to finish. When I volunteered to write that first blog, I thought I’d do just the writing part and someone else would get it up on the website. I didn’t realize that I would have to clone a repository, learn to use Git CMD, make commits, learn Markdown, and raise a pull request. These were all foreign to me and I was doing them for the first time. It was a great learning opportunity and I’m grateful for it.\n1. **Presentation** - We hold weekly meetings where contributors share what they’re working on and receive feedback. Presenting at these meetings has taught me to not just show my work, but to talk about it. I’m not a great orator so this was challenging for me at first but I’ve noticed that I’m getting more confident with each presentation I make. I’m gradually learning how to clearly articulate my thought process and have a valid justification for any route I choose to take to complete a task.\n1. **Design** - Making design contributions has helped improve the quality of my work. Sometimes, I’d nail a design on my first try. Other times, I may have to iterate several times before I get it right. The important thing is that I end up producing high-quality work. I’ve also learned to detach myself from my work, be objective, and gracefully accept constructive criticism.\n1. **Collaboration** - For the first time, I get to work together with developers and other designers. Thanks to Layer5.  I’m also learning to use communication and collaboration tools like Slack, GitHub, and ClickUp.\n\n### How You Can Contribute to Layer5\nMy experience clearly shows that you don’t necessarily need to know anything about coding or cloud native technologies to contribute to Layer5 projects. Are you a designer, technical writer, community manager, or digital marketer? There are several ways to contribute. You can\n- Work on improving the [documentation](https://docs.layer5.io),\n- Design new website pages or improve the UX of existing ones,\n- Warmly welcome newcomers to the community and offer support,\n- Give constructive feedback during the weekly meetings,\n- Talk about Layer5 and invite your friends to use and [star Meshery](https://github.com/meshery),\n- Write articles for our blog.\n\nThe list is endless. My advice is that you do not box yourself. Don’t feel that because you’re a designer, your contributions will be strictly design-related. If you want to make impactful contributions, pay attention to the needs of the community/project and help where you can.\n\nFor more guidance on contributing to Layer5, check out our [newcomer’s guide](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers).\n\n\n\\-- <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/victoria-nduka\">Victoria Nduka</Link>\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Contributing to Layer5: A Designer’s Journey","subtitle":"Insights from a visual design intern at Layer5","date":"January 7th, 2024","author":"Victoria Nduka","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/header-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAACgAAQUxQSBYAAAABF3D//4iIgkAQwsk8s9qBiP5nDsUAVlA4IHoAAADwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFWo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdAB0/ee7rnQZi638AAMstRxrtKSi7+7S8JymTGvCtcLKNLKKdplSAdauCkhgY2PJvuIh+bfYNM4XGU5sRiiIgEvM/Bf+BElPT/5qN9OgU8CEbdEgkn6py6rYfVa4AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/a66aa/header-image.webp 750w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/65dd5/header-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5632}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/header-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAACgAAQUxQSBYAAAABF3D//4iIgkAQwsk8s9qBiP5nDsUAVlA4IHoAAADwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFWo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdAB0/ee7rnQZi638AAMstRxrtKSi7+7S8JymTGvCtcLKNLKKdplSAdauCkhgY2PJvuIh+bfYNM4XGU5sRiiIgEvM/Bf+BElPT/5qN9OgU8CEbdEgkn6py6rYfVa4AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/6e8bd/header-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/46142/header-image.webp 125w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/81c3e/header-image.webp 250w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/6e8bd/header-image.webp 500w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/bf95e/header-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":282}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/contributing-to-layer5-a-designers-journey"}},{"id":"690d14af-2313-5129-bd8d-6fa3258ebe19","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\nimport Before from \"./before.png\";\nimport After from \"./after.png\";\nimport Five from \"./five-image.png\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nYou've probably seen tweets or LinkedIn posts celebrating the number of stars a project receives on GitHub. Maybe someone has even asked you to star their repository. If you've ever wondered how much of an impact your star could make on their project, you're in the right place. Let's explore what GitHub Stars are and explore the significant role they play in boosting a project.\n\n### What are GitHub Stars?\n\nGitHub stars are like virtual thumbs-up or bookmarks that you can give to projects you like on the GitHub platform. They're a way to show that you find a project interesting, useful, or valuable. When you star a project, when you star a project, it's represented at the [stargazers](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/stargazers) section of the repository.\n\nStars are one of the key metrics that GitHub uses to track and identify trending projects on its platform. When a repository gains a significant number of stars within a relatively short period, it can be an indicator that the project is gaining popularity, and consequently, qualifies as a \"trending project\". \n\nHere's how GitHub uses stars to track trending projects:\n\n1. **Star Activity** -\nGitHub monitors the rate at which repositories are being starred. Projects that receive a sudden surge of stars are likely to catch the attention of GitHub's algorithms.\n1. **Time Interval** -\nGitHub takes into account the time frame within which stars are accumulated. Projects that gain stars rapidly in a short span of time are considered for trending status.\n1. **Relative Comparison** -\nTrending repositories are often determined based on a comparison with their usual star activity. If a repository's star activity significantly exceeds its typical rate, it might be flagged as trending.\n1. **Consistency** -\nWhile rapid stars are important, consistent activity also matters. Projects that sustain their increased star activity over time are more likely to be recognized as trending.\n\nOnce a repository meets these criteria, it might be highlighted on GitHub's Trending page or other curated sections of the platform. This visibility can attract even more attention and stars, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the project's popularity.\n\n### Effect of Stars on a Project\nStarring a project on GitHub does not directly impact the project’s functionality, but it can have several positive effects which include:\n\n- **Visibility** -\nStarring a project increases its visibility. Projects with more stars tend to appear higher in search results, making it easier for others to discover and contribute to the project\n- **Community Engagement** -\nA higher number of stars can attract more contributors, users, and potential collaborators. It indicates that the project has generated interest and resonates with others.\n- **Motivation** - \nFor project maintainers and contributors, seeing their project receive stars can be motivating. It shows that their work is appreciated and valued by the community.\n- **Recognition** - Starring a project is a way for users to acknowledge and recognize the effort put into it. It’s a form of social validation.\n- **Contributor Potential** - Potential contributors might use the number of stars a project has as a signal of the project’s importance and popularity. A well-started project might attract developers looking for projects to contribute to.\n- **Feedback and Support** - Starring can also serve as a lightweight way for users to express their support for the project or to keep track of projects they find interesting even if they don’t actively contribute.\n\nOverall, starring a project helps create a positive cycle where visibility leads to engagement, engagement leads to contributions, and contributions lead to a stronger project.\n\n### How to Star a Repository\nStarring a repository is a simple two-step process.\n- **Step 1:** On [GitHub](https://github.com/meshery/meshery), navigate to the main page of the repository.\n- **Step 2:** At the top-right corner of the page, click Star.\n\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n    <img src={Before}/>\n    <figcaption>\n    Before adding a star\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n <br/>\n<p style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}> This is what a project will look like after you have starred it:</p>\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n    <img src={After}/>\n    <figcaption>\n    After adding a star\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n<br/>\n\n## Five Needs Your Stars\n\nNow that you understand how much impact stars can make, take a moment to help [Five on his Cloud Native journey](https://layer5.io/five/vol1/mascot-five-adventure-github-stars.pdf). Five is our intergalactic Cloud Native Hero on a journey to the Meshery planet. Five’s rocketship runs on stars and he needs all the stars he can get.

Currently, I am pursuing my \nstudies at ITM Gwalior, with a focus on building a successful career in Computer Science and Engineering.\n<h2 id=\"journey\">\"When and How did it all Start?\" ✈️</h2>\n<h3>Let's uncover the Origin Story</h3>\n\nIt all began at the start of the year when I made a resolute decision to dive into the world of open-source. Eager to contribute and make a difference, I actively participated in various communities, seeking opportunities to learn and grow.\nAmidst my exploration for exciting projects to contribute to, I stumbled upon Layer5. The moment I delved into their endeavors, I was captivated by the diverse range of tech-stack-driven initiatives they were involved in. Without hesitation, I knew that this was the perfect place for me to start.\n\nVenturing forth, I attended my very first Newcomers meet, a gateway to understanding the vibrant community and its wide array of projects. It was an enriching experience, immersing myself in the ethos of collaboration and knowledge sharing that defined the community's spirit.\nTaking a small yet significant step forward, I eagerly embraced a task assigned to me.\nI understood that even the tiniest actions can pave the way for monumental achievements. But my journey didn't halt there; fueled by my unwavering commitment, continuous skill development, and active engagement with the community, I witnessed remarkable progress.\nAnd then, within a mere two months, my dedication and contributions were acknowledged, leading to an incredible milestone—I was awarded an internship at Layer5.\n<h2 id=\"experience\">\n My Experience of Internship with Layer5🚶\n</h2>\n\n My internship at Layer5 was an extraordinary experience that allowed me to delve deep into the world of open-source and sharpen my skills in a real-world setting. \n Collaborating with talented professionals and working on cutting-edge projects enriched my understanding of various technologies and their practical applications.\n\n During my internship, I actively participated in team discussions, contributed to codebase enhancements, and gained hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and methodologies. \n This internship not only expanded my technical expertise but also provided invaluable insights into the dynamics of a professional work environment and including I was able to improve my communication skills\n as well.\n Overall, my internship at Layer5 was a transformative journey filled with learning, growth, and unforgettable experiences. I look forward to leveraging the skills and knowledge gained during this internship to make a positive impact in the world of technology.\n\n <h2 id=\"message\">\n  Message to other contributors📖\n </h2>\n\n I remeber myself when I joined the community that I was not aware of many things going in the community but I didn't got off from track, I did take 2 weeks\n to solve a graphql issue but I completed it. Many things are there that you may not know during joining the community but you learn along the journey and\n there is no fear in that. The thing is you can't set back and leave if you are unable to crack something. Learn and come back strong.\n This is community , this is Layer5.\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Internship Experience with Layer5 - Sudhanshu Dasgupta","subtitle":"Unleashing the Journey:

As a newbie to open-source, I was unsure about many things, but Shivam ( an amazing contributor ), welcomed me and suggested I should attend the Meshery Dev meet to learn more.\"\n      \"I picked up some issues and started working on them but soon hit a wall. Then one day, Lee Calcote messaged me and said he had me on his intern's list, but noticed I wasn't around the community much. So I reached out to Abhishek and Gaurav for help on how to get more involved. They showed me how to contribute and help others, and then I started attending dev calls, helping others, and making new friends.\"\n”After a while, I received a message from Lee and Gaurav saying that I would look good in the MeshMate logo I was surprised. It was one of the best things to happen to me, but also came with a responsibility to help others in the community and guide them on their journey.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a MeshMate and have been for some long time now. What does being a MeshMate mean to you? What does it take to be a successful MeshMate?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Being a MeshMate is not just an honor, it is also a responsibility towards the community. MeshMates are individuals who are committed to help other members of the community. This includes ensuring that community members have access to resources, are introduced to other members, and understand the vision and goals of the projects.”\n      \"I have always loved learning in a community because with a community, we can grow together. Similarly, MeshMates always make sure that their mentees are successful along with the project. It's a great feeling to be a part of a community where everyone is working towards the same goal and supporting each other along the way.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"I remember introducing Meshery and MeshMap in my college event. It was an incredibly successful event, and I take great pride in being a part of a community that supports such innovative projects. The response from the attendees was overwhelming, and I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the contributors who played a pivotal role in making this project a resounding success. Their collective efforts truly deserve admiration and appreciation.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      What is your favorite part of the Layer5 Community? Of being a MeshMate?\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"When I joined Layer5 community I got a welcome message with helping instructions so that I can contribute smoothly and I think this shows how much this community cares about their contributors which I like most about Layer5, everyone here is so welcoming and helping.\"\n      \"Being a MeshMate you get exposure in community which is really good for your growth but this is not best part of being a MeshMate, the best part is the feeling you get after helping someone and being little part of their success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      With the number of people  that join the Layer5 community everyday, how do you deal with the continued influx of newcomers?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Layer5 is big community over 4000+ members on slack and everyday so many people join Layer5 community and connecting with newcomers everyday is really not easy it takes time and your little strength too but as I said earliar, being a MeshMate also comes with responsibility which I enjoy most 😎.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Impressively, you’re also a software engineering intern at Layer5. How did this come to be? What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery and the Layer5 community?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Truelly I never joined Layer5 with mindset of internship after I joined Layer5 I saw here people learning new things as they are working on projects, making growth in their personality and improving engineering skills which is what I actually want. Layer5 offers internships all the time and these internships are offered to those who make impact in community and contribute consistently. After 2 months of making impact and contributing consistently I got mail with offer of internship.\"\n      \"Layer5 is growing everyday and many people started using Meshery, MeshMap and other projects for their businesses with this growth my personal goal is to work start helping projects in field of Devops and backend and also I like learning and sharing in public so I’ll also try to spread word of what we do here to appreciate everyone's effort.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\nNow, I’ve heard of Community Badges, but what are these? How many are there? More importantly, how do I collect the whole set?! 🙂\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Haha the way you are making impact in community soon you’ll get all Vivek, Badges are signs of contributors' efforts in their respective fields given by community. There are different badges for different efforts and I have this which represents MeshMate. I would really like to see you getting so many badges Vivek 😉.\"\n      \"Badges are not also easy to take, this requires your efforts and time towards community and its projects. As I said Layer5 community always wants its contributors' success because with their success it’s layer5's success and badges are one of the ways of recognising contributors' efforts.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re particularly proud of?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"😂 some of my favourite questions, I really like using this 🚀 emoji which represents the feeling of keep doing and keep pushing until it's done. I am mostly a night person, as I feel most productive during that time, although I don't recommend it.\"\n      \"I worked on different projects of Layer5 and I am proud for all of them though my favorite part is getting Meshery and MeshMap support default dark mode so that user will get smooth experience of using Meshery or MeshMap \"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Yes Cloud native ecosystem is so vast and constantly evolving. I think being part of cloud native community helps me stay up-to-date with its fast moving ecosystem and I’ll also suggest everyone to join community from any platform you like Slack, Twitter or your favorite platform \"\n      \"As I said Cloud native is so vast so as it’s community too there are so many updated resources available out their on internet by community, which helps me to keep update with Cloud native ecosystem\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> What  advice do you have for individuals who are hopeful to become Layer5 contributors, interns, or potentially MeshMates?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Try to come out of your comfort zone. If you are reading this conversation, you are already out of your comfort zone, which is a really good step. Who I am today is because I came out of my comfort zone, which I would also prefer. Lastly, be more helpful towards the community and, most importantly, be consistent. I wish you success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\"><img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\"/>The open source community at Layer5 is an award winning program and continues to evolve as it grows in number daily.

celebrated: we're now 4,000 members and growing. Layer5 is an open source community that stewards a number of projects spanning five GitHub organizations and over 80 repositories. Two of the community's projects have even been accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), a testament to the quality of work that the members produce.\n\n<img src={mesheryMostPopular} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" />\n\nWhat makes the Layer5 community truly special, however, is not just its impressive technical achievements, but the warmth and welcoming atmosphere that it provides for its members. This is a community that is passionate about collaboration, inclusivity, and supporting each other to reach new heights.\n\n\nMembers of the Layer5 community come from all backgrounds and levels of experience, and everyone is encouraged to get involved, share their ideas, and contribute to the projects that they are interested in. The community is always open to new members, and there are plenty of resources available for those who are just starting out or looking to expand their skills.\n\nOne of the most remarkable things about the Layer5 community is how supportive it is of its members. Whether you are a newcomer or a seasoned veteran, you will find that people are always willing to lend a hand, offer advice, or just provide a friendly ear when you need it.\n<Blockquote quote=\"Thank you for recognising me as a Layer5 member. It is an honour for me to be part of such a welcoming community. Even the smallest contributions are recognised. I am learning new things every day and so happy to belong to this community.\" person=\"Naureen\" />\n\nThis culture of support and collaboration has not gone unnoticed by the wider tech community. Layer5's Meshery project, for example, has been recognized as the #1 most popular Linux Foundation Internship (LFX internship).

In much the same way that non-techies develop a reverence for programmers courtesy of the film industry’s portrayal of them as wizards whose brains magically sprout up elaborate mathematical models and whose mouths eloquently spew technological jargon, so do newbies perceive contributors: a bunch of techies who debug in seconds, recite programming language documentation by heart and, well, create pull requests in their sleep (this is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point).\n</div>\n\n    This perception diminished any notion of our Stack Overflow and W3Schools-dependent selves ever having a shot at open source contribution. It often felt as if we haven’t attained the required caliber of ‘techie-ness’ requisite to join the erudite army of programming soldiers; that our match and stomps wouldn’t match the rhythm of these valiant sergeants.\n  <img src={mentees} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"layer5 mentees\" />\n    However, <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/programs/contributhon-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa’s Contributhon</a> program deconstructs this perception, moreso for women, by partnering with open source organizations like Layer5 and offering women the opportunity to receive mentorship that eases them into being ardent contributors.\n    After a rigorous selection process, we:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyindawodu\">Oyindamola Dawodu</a>, Frontend Developer\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edmucious\">Ednah Akoth</a>, Frontend Developer \n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  gained entry into SCA’s second contributhon program and would like to immerse you in the voyage that the contributhon program was through this article.\n  <h3>The Leaderboard Project</h3>\n    For 8 weeks, we have had the chance to immerse ourselves into Layer5’s open source contribution community by curating a leaderboard for <a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Layer5’s discussion forum</a> to show the most active participants based on various metrics such as likes received and posts created.\n    We built this leaderboard to encourage more intentional communication and exert positive peer pressure on community members, thereby subconsciously incentivising them to give more solutions to problems discussed on the forum, and actively engage with content posted by other members\n    The project has presented an immersive learning experience for us, right from learning how to navigate using the ubuntu terminal, learning how to set up a local discourse development environment and render web pages,  examining the discuss API documentation and understanding the API endpoints needed to fetch the required data and designing the UI (User Interface) of the leaderboard.\n  <h3>Challenges We Faced</h3>\n    Getting acclimated to the intricacies of the discourse development environment has been no easy feat. There were moments where we stared at code on discourse in utter oblivion on its purpose or functionality, or faced version issues that impeded our discourse instance’s ability to run. It sometimes got even more frustrating when something as simple as a fetch instruction that you have been writing for almost the entirety of your programming life fails to work and none of the Stack Overflow fixes work.\n    This question kept us going; How would we become the ardent <em>while in their sleep bug fixers</em> and prolific contributors if we don’t build the fortitude to weather such disheartening moments?\n     During moments like these, the Layer5 community, particularly <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</Link> and our mentors often saved the day, sharing resources or offering explanations on what ought to be done to salvage the situations.\n  <h3>Lessons We Learned Along the Way</h3>\n    Overall, the journey has exercised and built upon our skills repertoire in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Version Control, and induced us into the contribution workflow, right from finding an open issue to work on, setting up the required environment to developing the solution.\n    Furthermore, receiving feedback from both our mentors and members of the Layer5 community with regards to matters like the scalability of our data fetch methods, potential misuse of the leaderboard metrics to gain advantage, the converse outcome that our leaderboard could have (dishearten new members form contributing due to the seemingly low chance of their input reflecting on the board), more responsive UI fixes among others, helped us to become even more cognizant of the idea that we are developing not just for ourselves and our portfolios, but for a wider and greater audience.\n    We became more abreast with the idea of developing for a community or for a greater purpose and the imperative role of feedback in that development process. We became more comfortable with the idea that we essentially do not own the product despite all the sweat we pour into it; we are instead a part of a larger community that comes together to build a widely suitable, sustainable and inclusive product.\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\n    Through building this leaderboard for Layer5’s Community Forum, we have assimilated ourselves into the glorious match of soldiers that previously intimidated us. We stepped foot into the previously deemed insidious territory of open source contribution and realised that we too have a lot to offer in this ecosystem.\n    We have discovered a community of competent, supportive and serial problem-solvers, right from our mentors:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n    <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/ekene-leonard-nwobodo\"><img src={meshmate} style={{ height: \"1.25rem\" }} /> Ekene Leonard Nwobodo</Link>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/etienejames5\">Etiene James</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\">Ruth Ikegah</Link>\n    </li>\n     <li>\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/atinuke-oluwabamikemi-kayode\">Oluwabamikemi Kayode</Link>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n     to the entirety of the contributors, a knowledge powerhouse that we look forward to continue contributing and building towards.\n    Additionally, we would like to convey hearty regards to <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/\">She Code Africa</a> for availing this program as a stepping stone to women like us to get started in OSS. Their clarity in mission and vision execution and elaborate support structure has given a significant lift to women in Tech and curated a place where they can receive mentorship and the intellectual stimulation that necessitates and inevitably culminates to growth.\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"8 Weeks of Open Source Contribution with Layer5","subtitle":"#SCA Contributhon 2022","date":"June 7th, 2022","author":"Ednah Akoth & Oyin Dawodu","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgYBAABXRUJQVlA4IPoAAACwBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpE0oJSOiKA1RABoJbACdL8JLA7AawLgEJUu1oG/8VqhBxNLD/6xY5QAA+GNTNuzYeCqf0KGmw+WANz2VbD75vWZ1/xthsSLZyp8VFejLxsmsjQk3Ru4p01AnMqeTxYnFtbsPTfbCTrToINiKXPQ44kBmb+/98B4irWb/Q4pL0P/U8HXIH7zE6SCkzZL+dX5xeP2ZvCaZ7wPypBcDARYZEFLaF+nOw1ZvYg75QPef92MHfwP9zjDjw3RJuzn5mJF0kyM/0Z8U5rgqcbC6xqFA2rIfW/nSximAUBtPO18c99u+8YOyNfyVKhK4AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","srcSet":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f03f/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 750w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgYBAABXRUJQVlA4IPoAAACwBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpE0oJSOiKA1RABoJbACdL8JLA7AawLgEJUu1oG/8VqhBxNLD/6xY5QAA+GNTNuzYeCqf0KGmw+WANz2VbD75vWZ1/xthsSLZyp8VFejLxsmsjQk3Ru4p01AnMqeTxYnFtbsPTfbCTrToINiKXPQ44kBmb+/98B4irWb/Q4pL0P/U8HXIH7zE6SCkzZL+dX5xeP2ZvCaZ7wPypBcDARYZEFLaF+nOw1ZvYg75QPef92MHfwP9zjDjw3RJuzn5mJF0kyM/0Z8U5rgqcbC6xqFA2rIfW/nSximAUBtPO18c99u+8YOyNfyVKhK4AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/5f169/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","srcSet":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/d66e1/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 125w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/e7160/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 250w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/5f169/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 500w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/3cd29/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/8-weeks-of-open-source-contribution-with-layer5"}},{"id":"7c0a735e-8a00-5434-b029-bbafa1d4900e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport MMoY2021 from \"./meshmate-of-the-year-2021.svg\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport graduateLFX from \"./aditya-chatterjee-graduates-lfx-meshery-program.webp\";\nimport MeshMate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-stack.svg\";\nimport MMOYAditya from \"./MeshMate-of-the-Year-2021-Aditya-Chatterjee.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nNurturing a diverse, inclusive, and newcomer-friendly community like Layer5's is not easy.

I kept pushing myself with patience until I feel strong and capable enough to\n  take responsibilities and give my best to the community, Then I asked and applied for an internship and eventually, I got selected.\nNow I can make more impact and grow more under the right guidance.😃\n<h2 id=\"apart-from-coding\">Apart from coding</h2>\n  Besides coding at Layer5, I made many new friends, great experiences, and memories.\n  At last, I would say, join this amazing community and experience the change in yourself.

Like how most people formulate what and how they will do in the uni, I also came from normalcy. In Singapore, students are aiming to get the best mark in every possible lesson in college as our grades hold a very high importance in the culture. Going back and forth between classes, planning a startup with my peers, volunteering in community clubs, I had a spectacular two years in uni.\nHowever, during the last summer break, I started asking myself questions. How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you’re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad. Frankly, the experience wasn’t as good as I expected. Trying to pinch my way in a Google Summer of Code project, I am overwhelmed by numerous people trying to do the same.\n  I thought open source would be like this all the time and it failed me. But then, I took my second chance and joined Layer5. First two weeks, I tried to familiarize myself with the project and joined in the community calls. I remember sharing my screen the first time in the community call, and it was thrilling, my hands can't stop shaking. I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don't mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty. My thoughts on open source were wrong and I realize that it's just a little badness from the overall goodness. Just like Yin Yang. Layer5 has been a supportive community that not only develops your technical side, it nurtures your thinking and reasoning.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/rudraksh-pareek\">\n    Rudraksh Pareek\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Rudraksh } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"rudraksh-pareek\"/>\n  <br/>\n  My journey with open source started when I got into college and fell into the company of some geeky open source evangelists. They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software.\nHowever, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn't do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community. Whenever I was assigned something, I tried to get my teeth into it as deep as I could before reaching out for help. This helped me learn a lot in a healthy way.\n      There was so much happening around and I wanted to be a part of it all. So I started attending all the meetings and was able to put my finger into many pies. I soon became better at expressing my thoughts and pretty soon, I developed an interest in CI/CD practices. Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming.\nI learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications. However, this short span often leads to unjust outcomes.\n      Thus, I believe paying back for what you give to the project is a philosophy in the best faith of everyone in the long term. I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to.\nDuring the course of my internship, I'll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Layer5 Cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in \"on premise environments\". I'll also be collaborating with Ashish Tiwari on integrating a workflow engine with Meshery introducing best practices to be followed by management software.\nLooking forward to learning and growing during this time while continuing to try my best to help others in the community.\nThank you.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/nithish-karthik\"> Nithish Karthik </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Nithish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"nithish-karthik\"/>\n  <br />\n     I knew exactly what I wanted to do ever since my childhood, I wanted to become a programmer. Technology related stuff always intrigued me. But I had to prepare for an entrance examination IITJEE which required enormous dedication and focus to succeed. And so, I had to put my coding dreams on hold till I joined college.\nBut after I joined college, I felt a sense of freedom within me, in the sense that I could now pursue my passion wholeheartedly. So, the next question was, \"Where do I start ?\".\nThere were a lot of buzz words going around in my college among my peers like CP, Dev, AI and ML etc. I also noticed that people were forcing themselves to do them even when they had no sense of passion or appreciation towards the field. But for me, I always had more joy in the process of doing something than the outcome I get from it. So, I started exploring various fields to find what I loved the most. And I found that I wanted to do development.\n  So, I started working on myself. After I got the fundamentals clear, I wanted to have some practical experience to have an idea of how production grade products are being made. So, I worked on a couple of startups to get an exposure to real world development. And I learned a lot during that period. But then, I felt I needed to switch my gear. The idea of open source has always intrigued me the most but my efforts towards open source contribution has not been a success because,\n\n1. I always got intimidated by the size of codebase\n2. I didn't have people guiding me\n\nSome of my seniors, who had the best interest in me, encouraged me to get into open source, but I did not take it seriously because I felt intimidated by the idea. I instead thought I would look for some open source internships that way I would have someone mentoring me and that would help me in starting my open source journey. I went through many programs but most of them were closed at that time, except, Meshery in LFX. I thought, this is the only choice I have, let's do it, I had nothing to lose. I applied for that program and as a prerequisite, I had to engage with the community. I looked at the community calendar and I saw that there was a newcomer's call that day and I attended it. I have never had such a warm welcome in any other communities.\nOn that day, I knew that this community is special and I should spend more time with it. I explored the projects and as usual, I felt intimidated, but this time, I had people, wonderful people to help me. I landed my first open source PR, which was a single line style change. But the encouragement and support I got from the community for that was so wonderful . I realised that this community is not just about building best quality products but also about building best quality human beings. It has been a roller coaster ride with Layer5 since then. I got so involved with the process that I had stopped caring about getting that internship.\n   The community has really wonderful people who taught me not only about coding, but also about \"How to be\". I am really grateful that I found this community and I hope that everyone has a chance to experience this. \nI started engaging more in the community projects, especially Meshery UI and always kept coming up with ways to improve it.\n    And fast forward to September 2021, I was told to enroll for the LFX fall term mentorship program and here I am. But, this has never been the goal for me, there is more to me and Layer5 than this internship. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can.\n    Thank you\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/ashish-tiwari\"> Ashish Tiwari </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Ashish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"ashish-tiwari\"/>\n  <br />\n  I started my programming career in 2020 when my classmates were bagging internships.I started late because the first two years of my college I never thought that I was a \"programming guy\" as I always was more of a Physics/Mathematics guy. But in 2020, when the pandemic hit I started programming from \"hello world\". I thought I was too late to the party and often felt overwhelmed. After 1 year of getting a taste of everything from data structures, web development, databases and everything in between that a CS undergraduate comes across; I thought to call myself a Backend dev. But I still was dissatisfied and finding something interesting when I came across the concept of containerization which looked magic to me. From there it was a roller coaster ride to kubernetes and then understanding service meshes. I immediately was drawn into the entire CNCF ecosystem.\n  After procrastinating for a while, I learnt golang one night, made a side project to feel confident in it and dove back into watching CNCF talks explaining some exciting technology in Golang code.During all this my friend and also my current mentor, Utkarsh helped me through and through. He explained to me what Meshery is and I was immediately drawn in because Meshery is a good vantage point to the entire CNCF ecosystem. Believe me, while working on meshery at one point or another you will run into almost all major projects under CNCF. \nLike for any other beginner, it was all too overwhelming but exciting at the same time. Man it's such a rush when you realize that you don't know so much stuff because then there is an open window for absorbing all that stuff. I started going through docs, blogs and CNCF talks(shit that rhymed). I still binge CNCF talks. There is a plethora of good talks for you, if you are a beginner. I always prefer those over any \"youtube tutorials\". Anyways, back to my journey.\n  So two months ago, I found an open issue in mesheryctl. I solved the issue/enhancement, showed the code in a community meeting and got the PR merged. This was my first ever open source contribution. From there it just took off. I wrote a new command in mesheryctl then wrote unit tests. All this while trying to get an opportunity to write code for any core component like meshery server or adapters. Then one day I accidentally got into a WASM filter meeting(believe me,joined accidentally), got asked to add one feature and I said - \"yes\". And this is how it starts for most people. You get out of your comfort zone and say \"yes\", start learning new stuff, make mistakes, get corrected and the cycle continues. Fast forward two months, I was offered an internship.From what I have learnt as a person who started late is that you only need two things- \"Curiosity\" to ask questions out of your comfort zone and \"Resilience\" to absorb answers when they are thrown at you. Layer5 is an amazing community.\n  I guarantee you will not find such a warm and welcoming community so easily. If you come here for internships, you won't be here for long (or anywhere else to be honest). When your goals are solely to gain knowledge, experience while contributing to a niche, new and exciting tech- the opportunities will be waiting for you. I still have a long way to go and so much to learn. My journey with this project is certainly going to be longer than the span of this internship.\n  \\- Nithish, Ashish, Rudraksh and Bariq\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Fall Interns of 2021","subtitle":null,"date":"September 1st, 2021","author":"Interns of Fall 2021","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/ba84b/fall-interns.webp 750w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/3780a/fall-interns.webp 1080w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/bed15/fall-interns.webp 1366w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.39479166666666665}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/819ab/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/dcaba/fall-interns.webp 125w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fbfcc/fall-interns.webp 250w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/819ab/fall-interns.webp 500w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/478bc/fall-interns.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":198}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/meet-the-fall-interns-of-2021"}},{"id":"2e446807-bf62-5c69-ad6c-6261148f4a96","body":"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\nimport Sandy from \"./sandySCA.webp\";\nimport Abiola from \"./abiolaSCA.webp\";\nimport Cynthia from \"./cynthiaSCA.webp\";\nimport Elizabeth from \"./elizabethSCA.webp\";\nimport Blossom from \"./blossomSCA.webp\";\nimport Joy from \"./joySCA.webp\";\nimport Naimat from \"./naimatSCA.webp\";\n\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n    Layer5 participated as a suporting organization in the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa Contributhon</a> which started on April 1, 2021.

It was in the middle of the pandemic, though, with my mind trying to find an escape, that I stumbled upon Layer5. Within the first week of joining the Layer5 community, I had a pull request posted, and much to my surprise, found myself demo'ing it in the very next community meeting. In retrospect, it was a minor pull request, making some UI changes for Meshery. The encouragement I received was so welcoming and supportive. After that first week's experience, and so much technology and projects to explore, I was hooked - there was no turning back for me from that point.\n      I started learning more about the projects in Layer5 and its tech stack. From how Meshery Server was using gRPC and protobufs to communicate with each of its service mesh adaptors to defining how <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI Conformance</Link> works and the <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"https://layer5.io/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link> specification to how Meshery UI leverages some awesome libraries like NextJS, BillboardJS, and Redux. It has been through contributing to  each of these areas, that I have learned each of these technologies more deeply and it was all possible because of the continuous influx of awesome support from the community, especially <Link to=\"/community/members/abishek-kumar\">Abishek Kumar</Link> <i>and I probably won't stop poking him for support anytime soon</i>.\n      As I look forward to a structured internship with Layer5 through Google Summer of Code this summer, I do so knowing I will be collaborating with the large Layer5 community, engineers from other technology companies and spending a lot of time with Soham and Piyush. For my part, I'll be working on a visual topology to help service mesh operators map their deployments, model their application performance, and parse their service proxy logs. I am ready to make an impact, learn more, and help other community members ( and watch as they, too, are initiated into the Layer5 community through ritual of giving an awkward first-timer introduction in our Community Meeting 😛).\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/piyush-singariya\">\n    Piyush Singariya\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Piyush } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"piyush-singariya\" />\n      It all started with an idea, the idea of doing open source contributions. And with that after scrolling through many open source communities, I found Layer5, jumped up into our Slack workspace, started learning about Meshery. I raised a PR and was immediately made to feel like a rockstar. I began  meeting more of the community members, learning more about Meshery and its command line client, `mesheryctl` with each contribution. And you know, its extrenely gratifying to have your pull request merged, and that feeling is amplified by the feedback and attention you receive as a contributor at Layer5.\n      I knew that I wanted to engage even more deeply and learn all that I can from the seasoned engineers at Layer5. And so, I applied for internship. Layer5 takes internships seriously and doesn't accept anyone into internship until you have proven your commitment to their awesome projects.\n    And at the time of writing this, it’s been almost three months of contributing bfore being accepted as GSoC student. I have spent most of my time focusing on Layer5’s Meshery project and it’s command line client, `mesheryctl`.\n      And so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2021 program, which began on the night of May 17th, 2021 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). I am hyped up and excited to go ahead with Layer5 for the upcoming months.\n      My GSoC project is about introducing interesting and important features to Meshery Server and `mesheryctl`. Such as automating Documentation and Interactive playground for Meshery Server’s REST API endpoints, adding commands related to performance testing and enhancing Meshery’s environment health checking, introducing unit testing for `mesheryctl`, and CI/CD and documentation for all the new features.\n      It has been 2 weeks since I have started my GSoC’21 tenure with the Layer5 community, and from the very beginning (I mean before GSoC), I have learned a lot with my code contributions and the Community here. I began with setting up the performance command under mesheryctl and Open API Specification 2.0 for REST API documentation to the project. I am learning a lot of new things, like Unit Testing, Open API Specification, and much more to include.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/soham-sonawane\"> Soham Sonawane </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Soham } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"soham-sonaware\" />\n      I got to know about Layer5 last year in December when one of my batchmates told me that he was contributing to the community. He asked me if I wanted to join Slack and wanted to contribute to a project. So I looked at the projects on Github and some open issues that I could contribute to. Me being a frontend developer I saw an issue related to removing whitespaces and minor frontend changes. I just made a PR and it was merged then I joined the Slack workspace and attended the <Link to=\"/community/newcomers\">Newcomers</Link> meeting. I was introduced to a lot of things that I could work on. All of them felt amazing and interesting, all I had to do was “signal” and I could work on any one of them.\n    At first I thought that I should just work on layer5.io or maybe NightHawk, but then I was given an opportunity to work on something that I had never done before. It has been around 4 months that I have been a part of the community and I am actively trying to add to the project attending weekly meetings where everyone shares amazing stuff about what they did.\n      As I said earlier my project is something that I had never worked on before, very interesting to work on, it adds one of the most important and unique features to Meshery. Meshery's MeshMap enables users to visualize their service meshes, look at important statistics. It also enables users to design their own service meshes by either importing their designs from a yaml file or by dragging and dropping service mesh components into a\n    canvas, creating edges, grouping components, persisting these designs to see or edit later, realizing these designs by actually deploying them as service meshes and a lot more.\n    My job is to be the God of CytoscapeJS, who knows every nook and cranny of the library that enables us to create the visual topology. It's been a week since I have started my LFX internship and I have been working on visual topology even before that. These months of contributing code have taught me a lot. The first task that was given to me was to explore the\n    CytoscapeJS library and demonstrate a proof of concept of animated edges between 2 components. I sat for 3 hours straight right after the community meeting creating the demo and posted a video on our slack. I was never\n    appreciated better than on that day. I have never looked back since, each time I am given a feature or issue or any request I try my hardest to realize it in the earliest. I am constantly trying to improve myself and add to the project.\n  \\- Dhruv, Piyush, and Soham\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Summer Interns of 2021","subtitle":null,"date":"June 4th, 2021","author":"Interns of Summer 2021","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/summer-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABAAAQUxQSGQAAAABcFtr25o88QR3d3cvwxK6AC2dDkBN72P4AGEAOlgsIgJHCXDnQCz2YHtdHnbEF0DCBKHe9LOfN80BrrwM8WEE1AQ8v9bnhjcEJNKAPrIzi+B818qDhlEttZp+e61W147/088CVlA4IGYAAACQAwCdASoUAAUAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZAABHoV+8RiKrokAAP7+400U/hjfJHvPefa1O9FA2/QHgy6inrA2rR6X/zGBL8//g3I+Z49f/wXhnpHMcgAIo99chAo92CPdZdQYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/d6f9c/summer-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/82f05/summer-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/05038/summer-intern.webp 1080w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/5f183/summer-intern.webp 1366w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/d6f9c/summer-intern.webp 1917w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.25508607198748046}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/summer-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABAAAQUxQSGQAAAABcFtr25o88QR3d3cvwxK6AC2dDkBN72P4AGEAOlgsIgJHCXDnQCz2YHtdHnbEF0DCBKHe9LOfN80BrrwM8WEE1AQ8v9bnhjcEJNKAPrIzi+B818qDhlEttZp+e61W147/088CVlA4IGYAAACQAwCdASoUAAUAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZAABHoV+8RiKrokAAP7+400U/hjfJHvPefa1O9FA2/QHgy6inrA2rR6X/zGBL8//g3I+Z49f/wXhnpHMcgAIo99chAo92CPdZdQYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/a2885/summer-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/38508/summer-intern.webp 125w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/b8c78/summer-intern.webp 250w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/a2885/summer-intern.webp 500w,\n/static/c91d807a2b5af2865ee35680242d72c7/efaf3/summer-intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":128}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/meet-the-summer-interns-of-2021"}},{"id":"7cfc62a6-91e4-58c8-a0a9-a72f1f95bbc8","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport MMoY2020 from \"./meshmate-of-the-year-2020.webp\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\nimport MeshMate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-stack.svg\";\nimport MMOYNikhil from \"./MeshMate-of-the-Year-2020-Nihkil-Ladha.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n  If you are in the Layer5 Community, no doubt, you've met <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\" className=\"highlight\">Nikhil Ladha</Link>.

The MeshMate program pairs\n  experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a\n  smooth onboarding experience. Helping community members takes all forms from\n  ensuring the member has access to resources, is introduced to others,\n  understands the vision and goals of projects, can build and contribute to\n  projects, can use projects and have their feedback heard. MeshMates aid in\n  identifying areas of projects and activities within the community to engage\n  within, which working groups to join, and in help community members grow in\n  their open source and cloud native knowledge.\n  There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move\n  fast. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates share tips on how to have the best\n  community experience possible, but also build a relationship with the\n  community member inevitably leaving a lasting mark as is evident from member\n  comments about Nikhil.\n  \n<h3 style={{ padding: \"2rem 0\" }}>It's not easy being a MeshMate</h3>\n\n  With thousands of members in the Layer5 community, many come and go.

To help them acheive their goals, each individual\n  is engaged 1:1 by their Meshmate, supporting them in becoming a landstanding\n  Layer5 community member and contributor. MeshMates understand that many\n  mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all overcome their\n  hurdles in finding an area of the community to call home or aspect of a\n  project to own.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  style={{ width: \"100%\" }}\n  style={{ position: \"relative\" }}\n  quote=\"Congratulations on being our community maintainer superstar, Nikhil.

But, when it comes to contributing to Meshery it only gets more and more meshy!\n\n### Get set go!\n\nI was introduced to the world of open source through the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a> project in the august of 2019 and have since then been continuously exploring the farthest reaches of Meshery, Layer5, the parent SMI project and consecutively the CNCF landscape.\nAt the time of writing this, I have been a part of the Meshery project for about a year. Fascinated by the concept and further lured in by the welcoming community at Layer5, I was soon dipping my toes into the tidal wave of code. Starting out with small contributions to improve the UI, I stumbled on to my first issue, which was to open a page in a new tab instead of opening it in the same tab. Basic, right?\n\nI’m pointing this out to unravel the myth and smoke clouds around open source projects. Contributing can be as easy as altering a few lines of code and can be as meaningful as writing a whole new feature adapter. Since then, I have crossed small and big hurdles, meandering through countless issues and have become a part of the wholesome community, gaining friends and mentors along the way.\n\n### Stepping stones\n\nLet’s begin with the basics. What is Layer5?\n\nAt Layer5, we champion developer-defined infrastructure, giving engineers the power to reshape application delivery. We empower operators in reimagining how they manage modern infrastructure: collaboratively.\n\n### Roadblocks\n\nComing to my contributions at Layer5, I have mostly been involved in improving the UI and shaping the company site’s present outlook. I have also tried my hand at other projects, including the `mesheryctl` and the `landscape` at Layer5. In fact, here is a comprehensive list of **[my contributions across Layer5 projects](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+author%3ANikhil-Ladha+org%3Alayer5io)**.\n\nThe above mentioned links are just the **visible** contributions made by me. With time, I have grown and was soon approached to become a [MeshMate](/community/meshmates), an initiative which involves few seasoned contributors like me who will hold the hand of a new member and help him/her bridge the gap and take the leap into open source.\n\n### Tricks of the Trade\n\nThe benefits of being a UI engineer?\n\nWeb developers are required in every company in one meaningful way or the other as every single project needs a frontend to showcase it’s capabilities to the user. Coming to Layer5, the frontend of Meshery is built on React( another masterpiece from Facebook! ), which I learned from scratch when I joined the community.\n\n<img src={SignedBook} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"Nikhil-ladha-work\" />\n\nNow, months have passed and with some healthy dedication and hours of staring at thousands of lines of code, I have a good base and practical experience with React, something which you can’t hope to gain from personal projects and require a community for.\n\nThe Layer5 and Meshery websites are built using Jekyll, another technology about which I didn’t have any practical knowledge a couple of months ago. Easier than react and harder than CSS, Jekyll is perfect for the aspiring web developers out there and is also another reason for you to pop over to the Layer5 repo after reading this article.\n\n### Meshy goodness<br/>\n\nMy experience at Layer5 has made me proud of the work that we do and has challenged me time and again to reach for higher goals. I still have a hunch that someway or the other my contributions are responsible for getting me an internship at Red Hat! All heads bowed to [Lee Calcote](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote/) for his presence and guidance and to the Layer5 community for being as amazing as it is. My journey at Layer5 has been an ever growing curve to be honest from just a contributor to a MeshMate to the maintainer of few projects at Layer5. And, true to god this wouldn’t have been possible without the combined effort from me and our very own Lee Calcote. His trust and confidence in me is what encourages me to contribute more and more at Layer5 and see it grow to some next level in the coming future.\nMotivated or moved or still confused?\n\nWant to experience the same feeling and see yourself recognized as an Open-source contributor?\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My journey from a contributor to a maintainer!","subtitle":"","date":"August 11th, 2020","author":"Nikhil Ladha","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/5f169/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/d66e1/pic1.webp 125w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/e7160/pic1.webp 250w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/5f169/pic1.webp 500w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/3cd29/pic1.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-journey-from-a-contributor-to-a-maintainer"}},{"id":"a45a606d-6f4a-5ecd-883a-d61a271c015d","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nI started a new job at [RemoteState](https://www.linkedin.com/company/remotestate/) as a software development engineer in May of 2020.\nPost the initial plunge, settling into the role was relatively easier for me due to the experience I had gained in working on open source contributions in the Layer5 community. My experience with open source had also been a big plus for me throughout the application and interview process. As a direct result, my colleagues and seniors became genuinely inquisitive about Meshery and its functionality as the Kubernetes Manager. So when asked, I happily agreed  to deliver a session on the subject to the entire team.\n\nI pitched my idea to [Lee Calcote](https://layer5.io/community/members/lee-calcote) and in his usual supportive form, he was as excited as I was about the session. A brainstorm session led to creating an entire presentation with suggestions from Lee. The Layer5 community offers a number of resources to contributors, including these two decks ([Meshery - the cloud native management plane](https://layer5.io/meshery) and [Layer5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tLcMcyQ-Z6YYISYyR0Eyb30dojQiKHIjs7Rt5m8kcag/edit?usp=sharing) that I drew from as a basis for a personalized presentation and demonstration to my new team.\n\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQNpnp_SIkYNMe1rx-Cw_armxHRmQvkcp8d3BVML6XEhsSgy7k0w9xDKrGGs4EPew/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowfullscreen={true} mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></center>\n\nWhen the day arrived to present the concepts of cloud native infrastructure, Meshery, and other cloud native initiatives to my team, I held a Google Meet with a full attendance. I started the session with a reader’s digest version of microservices and cloud native infrastructure to set the stage for any newcomers to the world of cloud native, I went on to elaborate on Layer5 ‘s contributions to the CNCF landscape and the SMI project. This was followed by an in-depth discussion on data planes, control planes, and management planes. I spoke at-length about Meshery’s functionality including, its features for facilitating the benchmarking, interoperability and standardization of cloud native infrastructure. I wrapped up the session with some insider tips that I have learned in my months as an open source contributor in the Layer5 community. In the stream of feedback received from my colleagues, the session seems to have been a success.\n\nThis whole experience has been an amazing journey for me. From being a complete noob to utilizing my expertise in the cloud native infrastructure domain to landing an actual job, the experience has been a maze of ups and downs. But, I feel like I have finally arrived and arrived with a pot of gold. I’m eternally grateful to Lee Calcote for motivating me and providing me with the appropriate resources. Entering and exploring an open source community can be a daunting task and the [resources provided by Layer5](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) helped them in overcoming that challenge and enabled them to learn more about the widespread work of [Meshery](https://meshery.io).\n\nI’m glad to have found a community that not only feeds my professional success, but also my personal growth. It’s not out of obligation, but out of a sense of gratitude and paying it forward to others (a tenant of the Layer5 community) that I now spend much of my time as a MeshMate. I help welcome and guide other new contributors along their open source path as they learn and grow. Giving to others and while continuing to grow professionally and personally is time well spent.   I encourage you to join me and others in the Layer5 community by jumping into our [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/) to start meshing around!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How I schooled my seniors","subtitle":"and why I swear by the experience","date":"August 4th, 2020","author":"Nupur Thakur","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/15f20/feature-image.webp 750w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/9a568/feature-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp 1188w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6691919191919192}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/d03f3/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/a16f1/feature-image.webp 125w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/48571/feature-image.webp 250w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/d03f3/feature-image.webp 500w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/976f0/feature-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":335}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/how-i-schooled-my-seniors"}},{"id":"84298721-6095-5aac-89d3-02e19185dfe3","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport pic1 from \"./pic1.webp\";\nimport pic2 from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\nimport pic3 from \"./pic3.webp\";\nimport pic4 from \"./pic4.webp\";\nimport pic5 from \"./pic5.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nIt all started 9 months ago when I stumbled across the following LinkedIn post, written by a college senior who had recently scored an internship with Redhat.\n\n<img src={pic3} alt=\"book\"/>\n\nThis led me to a long-winding conversation with Subham Kumar Rai and Anand Kumar Singh about Layer5 and how amazing an opportunity it would be to be a part of this emerging community. I did some research on Kubernetes and made my way to the Layer5 Github repo. From there, it was a swift journey to the Layer5 Slack Channel where I truly understood what Subham had meant about the warm welcome. I was amazed by how helpful and willing the entire community was. Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).\n\n<img src={pic4} alt=\"github-profile\"/>\n\n#### What is Meshery?\n\nMeshery is a multi-platform management that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of Kubernetes and cloud platforms and applications.<br/>\n\n<img src={pic1} alt=\"meshry\"/>\n\nAs a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\n <br/>\nMeshery seamlessly integrates with every CNCF project, your existing tools, multiple Clouds and Kubernetes clusters.<br/>\n\n<img className=\"align-right\" src={pic2} alt=\"Lee Calcote\" />\n\n#### Lee Calcote\n\nLee Calcote is an innovative leader and has previously made waves in the tech community as a Docker Captain and a Cloud Native Ambassador and that is just a milestone in his impressive journey, which consists of his admirable work with developer platforms, cloud technology, containers, functions, and applications. Advanced and emerging technologies have been a consistent focus through Calcote’s tenure at SolarWinds, Seagate, Cisco, and Pelco. In my tenure at Layer5, Lee has been an amazing mentor, someone you can always look towards for encouragement, inspiration and a kind word, especially when you’re melting under the heat to make that late night deadline.\n\n\n#### Layer5 and UEM Jaipur Partnership Program\nIn an effort to foster the open source community in my college, I along with four of my batchmates (Anand, Subham, Nikhil, Gunjan) decided to start an open source partnership program, encouraged by Lee and Rupayan Das (Faculty, UEM Jaipur). This will hopefully lead to making future batches more aware about the essence of open source and encourage them to participate in communities like Layer5.\n\n<img src={pic5} alt=\"layer5\"/>\n\n#### Community Love\n\nThe Layer5 community has welcomed me with patience and has given me a sense of purpose, which is more than I could have asked for at the beginning as a novice developer. The warm welcome and a sincere string of mentors can do wonders in building your confidence and enabling you to put in your best foot forward. Open source has introduced me to a horde of essential qualities, such as the importance of teamwork, candor and earnestness. <br/>\nIt has been a prodigious journey so far and I don’t intend to stop here. The pace at which the projects under the Layer5 community are unwinding is awe-inspiring. It is my aim to be a witness and a partner in crime in its future endeavors.

But is this a badge of honor for a select few, or a recruiting pipe dream? Let's dissect the concept to see if it holds water.\n\nOn the one hand, there's no denying vast skill gaps exist. Some engineers possess an uncanny ability to solve problems, architect elegant systems, and write clean, efficient code. Their deep understanding and relentless focus translate to impressive results.  However, is this a tenfold difference?  \n\nHere's where skepticism creeps in. The \"10x\" is a nebulous term.  Metrics for programmer performance are complex.  Lines of code churned? Bug fixes closed?  These don't capture the entire picture.  A single line of genius can be worth weeks of rote coding. \n\nFurthermore, the myth often overlooks the power of teamwork.  A talented engineer paired with a brilliant communicator can achieve far more than the sum of their parts.  A supportive team environment that fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing can significantly elevate everyone's performance. \n\nSo, is the 10x engineer a myth? Not entirely.  There are undoubtedly exceptional engineers who deliver remarkable results. But it's likely a spectrum, not a binary. Focusing on building strong, well-rounded teams that leverage individual strengths and create a space for open communication might be a more fruitful approach than chasing the elusive 10x rockstar. \n\nHere's what we can learn:\n\n* **Celebrate exceptional skills:** Recognize and reward engineers who consistently deliver high-quality work.\n* **Focus on team dynamics:** Foster an environment of collaboration and knowledge sharing to elevate everyone's game. \n* **Beware the myth:** Don't get caught up in the idea of a single superstar solving all your problems. \n\nBy creating a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, you might not find a 10x engineer, but you might just build a 10x team. \n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Mythical 10x Engineer","subtitle":"Rockstar or Illusion","date":"May 8th, 2024","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADQAAQUxQSDoAAAABT2Akgtr0PYoGOBx6uRYR8akw7KCathXrK4cUQgghgKMSQwoBz3sAIvo/ATXWHtsnfMK2xIQDJIAAVlA4IK4AAACQBACdASoUAA4APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoHgd56oCA4aMdhJR4QGY9gA/qofayMU/lgReuEpKR39SxNWVbJzhOyp/GftzgE+djIyBXzel3U4ctaaAvjoePFJl/BFsnQznl55aHlNXI6A9phW9cnhsl1a49TBbJgIRgv7j0QKJOOqGZrI4rwu9XFJ9Cv7pFLOf4xjQ4FqpIjbWC61zymVn+kOKIlchLix4AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/4b14f/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","srcSet":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/f03b4/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 750w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/3cf39/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1080w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/4b14f/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1193w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6764459346186085}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADQAAQUxQSDoAAAABT2Akgtr0PYoGOBx6uRYR8akw7KCathXrK4cUQgghgKMSQwoBz3sAIvo/ATXWHtsnfMK2xIQDJIAAVlA4IK4AAACQBACdASoUAA4APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoHgd56oCA4aMdhJR4QGY9gA/qofayMU/lgReuEpKR39SxNWVbJzhOyp/GftzgE+djIyBXzel3U4ctaaAvjoePFJl/BFsnQznl55aHlNXI6A9phW9cnhsl1a49TBbJgIRgv7j0QKJOOqGZrI4rwu9XFJ9Cv7pFLOf4xjQ4FqpIjbWC61zymVn+kOKIlchLix4AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/8ce14/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","srcSet":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/07796/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 125w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/ad63b/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 250w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/8ce14/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 500w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/5593d/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":338}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/the-mythical-10x-engineer"}},{"id":"66a70456-5f2b-56b8-a568-56f2d6b54584","body":"import { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport Profile from \"./thumbnail.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<img src={Profile} align=\"right\" alt=\"profile-img\"  width=\"380\" height=\"500\" />\n\n<h2 id=\"collaboration\">Layer5 collaboration with OpenForce 2022</h2>\nGreat News!🎉🎉   \nOpenForce2022 by CodeFlow is here!
