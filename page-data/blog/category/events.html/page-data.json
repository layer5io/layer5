The story just gets better. This podcast goes deep into service meshes, load generators, circuit breaker, service mesh patterns in addition to a live demo of <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and more. Hosted by Henrik from Perfbytes and joined by Mark, <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\">Lee Calcote</Link> from Layer5 and Mrittika Ganguli from Intel. Tune in to find out more. Get answers to all community questions as a bonus.\n<h3>What is a service mesh?</h3>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nService mesh is one of the solutions that helps you to route traffic within your cluster so as to expose your services outside the cluster. It is a solution to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. You have different options like the service type load balancer or using ingress but service mesh makes sense because it will manage a lot of features around your service to service communication.\n\n</div>\n\nIn general, service meshes arose from the concept of proxies such as the NGINX proxy. Then Envoy was introduced by Lyft. Lyft had the architecture, and Google came along and created it. That gave us Istio, which is now part of CNCF. \n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"We were slugging it out in our labs trying to figure out how to do performance benchmarking with a service mesh. Instead of ten tools, if we had just one, it would be nice. Then we see Meshery come into the field\"\n  person=\"Mrittika\"\n/>\n\nService meshes, according to Lee, \"hit a real sweet spot personally\", having been focused on networking for most part of his career.\nHe believes that there are a couple of different ways to speak about the genesis of service meshes, with Linkerd being the first to coin the term.\nWe had Linkerd v1 written in scala and use jvm and then came Linkerd v2 which is something totally different at this point. It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed. There's a new one that's been softly announced in beta from called Cilium that is helping bring back some of the different architectures of how to run the proxies.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n\nThe way I prefer to think about a surface mesh is that it's all about resiliency.\nIf you were to take a three-tiered web or three-tiered app and you think about how you're breaking out those tiers with some amount of\nkind of vertical scaling,  you'd probably, end up putting at least a virtual IP address out in front of the whole web tier and then you've got an app tier and a database tier because you've got multiple instances of those things. Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\n\n</div>\n\nHenrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable. \nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\nHenrik recalled that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and when he first saw Meshery, his immediate thought was, \"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\"\n\n\nLets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n\n<h3>Meshery</h3>\nIf you were on a pager and were managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff. You might soil myself if you had to go make a change in that sea of yaml. That's in part what we're working towards. There's a capability within Meshery for solving this challenge. As a cloud native management plane, Meshery presides over top of 10 different types of service meshes and it also presides over kubernetes. You can run it outside of kubernetes or inside of kubernetes.\nMeshery has a number of components to its architecture. There is Meshery UI. It has a Mesheryctl, which is a CLI component. We have a number of service mesh adapters for each service mesh that Meshery supports.\n<h5>What is the need for different adapters?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nMeshery, as the multi-mesh manager, supports couple of different adapters. Adapters are used by Meshery to manage the numerous service meshes. Different service mesh adapters are written to expose the unique value of each service mesh. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each service mesh is not equally capable as the other. Some of them work in a similar way. Some of the service meshes have their own differentiated value, which is why there are individual adapters. Some of them work slightly differently depending on whether they're running as a managed service or not.\n\n</div>\n\n\nWe have a plug-in for Meshery it's called <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>, it is what you might consider a visual topology. It has a lot of use cases for observing in kind of a read-only mode. There's a second mode to this tool: The Designer Mode. It's a visual configurator of not only the specific settings within any of those service meshes that it supports like a circuit breaker and adjusting the sensor video\nbut also end up being a visual designer for your kubernetes deployments. When users drop in, they're able to go over and grab the specific capabilities of any of those service mesh adapters that are loaded for any of the versions of that mesh that they might want to design. The concept here is that they drag and drop these capabilities over and there's a bit of discoverability that's afforded through this ui rather than parsing through yaml, trying to understand what's going on.\n\n<img src={ConsulDemo} alt=\"Consul MeshMap Demo\" className=\"slides-right\"/>\n\nI like to pretend that I know a lot about service meshes, but when it comes to having to keep track of all of them, I don't know what the gateway tls sds config is, and so this type of inline help is quite useful to design your deployments. The deployments may or may not use a mesh; in fact, you can use this to create your Kubernetes configuration and deployment as well.  You can even save and recall those designs.\n\nTaking this example of consul, produced by hashicorp, is a little more of an\nintriguing deployment and a simple two-tier deck.  We announced the <Link to=\"/docker-extension-meshery\">Meshery Docker Extension</Link> recently. So if you're using docker desktop, Meshery will be a first class app that's available inside of market and part of what it does as it integrates with docker desktop is it will import docker compose apps convert them to kubernetes manifests or kubernetes apps and they'll let you deploy those formerly docker compose apps onto a mesh which is why I'm talking about a two-tiered service.\n\n<h5>Does MeshMap allow you to load the current configuration that is has been applied in the current cluster?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nCurrently, there are two modes: the one we were looking at before was the designer mode, and the one we'll be looking at now is the visualizer mode, which is probably a little more of an it's not entirely read-only to the extent that you could grab a pod and start an interactive session with the containers in that pod or you could you start a logging session. You could also initiate a performance test against  that particular service or that particular endpoint. \nMeshery supports three different types of load generators, which is a nighthawk, fortio and wrk2. \n\n</div>\n\n<h5>What are the capabilities of these three load generators? When you speak about service mesh testing or performance testing, what is actually the process behind the scene? What should users think about when they're starting a gig and need to configure and optimize the service mesh?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nLee expounds on that for our benefit. \nIt takes weeks to months that you've got to dedicate for performance engineers to go over and like pull together various tools and scripts around them to then get into a spreadsheet or into some database that you then generate results. \nThe genesis of Meshery part was to help people comprehend what a service mesh is, when to use one and which one to use?  As you go to explain these common questions, the real answer is a totally disappointing, which is, it just depends on what you're asking to do.\nPeople want to measure it in cold hard quantitative metrics but if you're asking to do 100 percent sampling then also consider the distributed tracing implementation you had somewhere else and the fact that you're getting it\nin a uniform way here. Maybe you're likely to consider the overhead that you would have over there. It's frustrating to be trying to explain stuff to folks and get them excited about the tech and and to give them a vague response. Instead we give them a tool that says \"Hey look here's a tool that will deploy any of the service meshes that you want to test out.\"\nThere's a reason why there's ten of them like and actually many more than that.\nThere's a lot of overlap between them but different tools for different purposes for different size orgs, so it would be inappropriate to say well you know here's the one. It's rather hey here's a tool that that lets you deploy any number of them quickly, answer your own question about performance, because we can pump out benchmarks of the various service meshes under various configurations, using different types of workloads but which may or may not match your environment and over time those reports are going to get stale and so rather he's a tool to make you empowered.\n\n</div>\n\n<h5>Do you actually generate traffic that will go through the sidecar proxy of the service and then reach out the actual service?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nThat load is generated on demand or on schedule against one or more endpoints, one or more of your services or something that is not even on your service. You can generate load not only against something running within your infrastructure but something external as well to do statistical analysis based on the configuration that you gave it and so yeah the answer is yes the traffic flows through the sidecar.\n\n</div>\n\n<h5>If I say I have never scripted or built any scenarios for fortio or nighthawk. Let's say I'm a loadrunner, a neoload, or a k6 user, and I want to accomplish the same thing with them. So what is the journey on those load generator? is it the same thing you have to build a workflow of requests that you want to send in that scenario?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nThat leads us to probably talk about one of our other projects which is called <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\"> Performance</Link> which is a specification. It's another one of the projects that we've donated to the CNCF. Service Mesh Performance is the spec while Meshery is an implementation of the spec. \nAt a high level, if those other load generators were to adhere to how we standardize and describe the test that you want to run and then hand off that configuration to generate the performance profiles that are created here  you're not gonna down download them but the descriptor is important.\nThis implements a standard for the industry on what is the actual\nservice mesh test and then standardize the format so then anyone can use the same format to design their script or whatever they want and then use it to test. \nSo when I build a script, and I don't know loadrunner today and I want to use neologo tomorrow, then I don't have to rewrite everything. Great!\n\n</div>\n\nMissed the podcast? No worries, we got you covered.

Cloud native architectures call for horizontally scalable, distributed systems design with microservices proliferated from Cloud to Edge. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network’s objective is to enable widespread and effective development, deployment, and operation of resilient and intelligent network systems in cloud native environments, keeping an eye on the needs of workloads, developers who design them, and operators who manage them.\n    Lee Calcote (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lcalcote\">@lcalcote</a>) is an innovative product and technology leader, passionate about empowering engineers and enabling organizations. As the founder and CEO of Layer5, he is at the forefront of the cloud native movement. Ken Owens (<a href =\"https://twitter.com/kenowens12\">@kenowens12</a>) is the Vice President, Cyber Cloud Security Engineering at FISERV. Owens is a technologist and an innovator with more than 20+ years of experience in a plethora of technologies and has been championing the cloud native movement for more than a decade now.\n    As an introduction to TAG Network, Owens  describes  the group’s  core objectives and reasons for its formation, summarized below:\n<ul>\n<li>Listening to ideas and collaborations</li>\n<li>Assisting and attracting projects</li>\n<li>Building communities and providing impartial stewardship</li>\n</ul>\n    Calcote and Owens are frequently asked a common question <em>“Is it important for the organization to be a part of CNCF to participate in the TAG Network group?”</em>. Owens emphasizes that anyone can participate, regardless of whether or not their company is a CNCF member organization. It does not require any payment and is an open-source effort in its spirit.\n<h3>CNCF TAG Network Projects and various stages they go through:</h3>\n<img src={Projects} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Tag Networks Projects\" />\n\n    One of the important goals of the TAG Network is to identify the unique projects that want to participate and shepherd their journey through CNCF project levels. Project-fit and the process of assessment for inclusion in the CNCF require your project to be on terms with the following essential traits:\n<ul>\n<li>Uniqueness</li>\n<li>Problem it solves</li>\n<li>Value it brings to the community</li> \n<li>Market demand</li>\n<li>Diversification </li>\n</ul>\n    Creating and stewarding any one of these projects is a significant undertaking. The  project's maintainers pitch the project and explicate how their project meets the above traits.\n    You start in a sandbox and work your way up to an incubation area once you've demonstrated a fundamental interest and understanding of the space, as well as some adoption. To graduate, the project must satisfy the required traits, be open-source, provide value and solve a problem effectively. We don't want to promote a CNCF project that is solely driven by one source. Diversification is crucial to the core of any CNCF project. Owens shared a subtle analogy, <em>\"a truly open source project is one in which contributors belong to the companies A+B+C...Z instead of just company A\"</em>\n<h4>Working Groups and papers, and how they work.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Data Plane API and Service Mesh WG are the two working groups stewarded by TAG Network.</li>\n<li>They utilize Kubecon to educate about the functioning of working groups.</li>\n<li>Whitepapers and publications are carried out by working group members. A Recent publication was published in the IEEE Bridge magazine, entitled <Link to=\"/resources/service-mesh-performance/analyzing-service-mesh-performance\">Analyzing Service Mesh Performance</Link>.</li>\n<li>Further goals include getting into the IEEE Communications Society and publishing an article entitled Techniques of Service Mesh Optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe majority of the more detailed activities occur in the CNCF Service Mesh Working Group - a subgroup of TAG Network. The deep-dive unveiled many individual initiatives, the majority of which have a common thread: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Meshery is the cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of workloads.\n\n    It's a Meshy world out there! As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. Calcote gives us a walkthrough of two Service Mesh Specifications:\n<ul>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI):</Link></b> SMI focuses on the interoperability of the various features of a service mesh.</li>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance (SMP):</Link></b> SMP tries to make it uniform and succinct the way you characterize the performance of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src={Smi} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{ marginLeft: \"10px\" }} alt=\"SMI\" />\n<img src={Smp} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{ marginLeft: \"10px\" }} alt=\"SMP\" />\n    Owens and Calcote also discuss <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link> and Service Mesh Catalog. These patterns promote the reuse of best practices, are service mesh agnostic, and also help in behavior analysis. A circuit breaker test is a good example.  If something goes wrong in your network be it a node failure, router failure, etc., then it helps you identify the point of failure as well as gets your network running quickly.\n<img\n    src={Catalog}\n    className=\"slides\"\n    alt=\"Service Mesh Catalog\"\n    style={{ display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\" }}\n/>\n\n\n    Talking about distributed systems, we come across the problem of distributed analysis. In this talk, the TAG Network co-chairs help us understand this problem and why we must worry about it.\n<ul>\n<li>Many performance characterizing tools are limited to single instance load generators. This limits the amount of traffic and the variety of behavioral analysis.</li>\n<li>Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles.</li>\n<li>How to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before deploying to production. </li>\n</ul>\n    This brings us to <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Together they help produce robust, distributed and scalable services. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.\n<img\n    src={Gnh}\n    className=\"slides\"\n    style={{ display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\" }}\n    alt=\"GetNighthawk\"\n />\n\n<strong>Calcote and Owens packed a great deal of information in this talk.
