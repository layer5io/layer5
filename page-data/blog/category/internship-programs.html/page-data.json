I started going through the \n[README](https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme), and it just felt like that is it. \nIt integrates with all kinds of technologies that I ever wanted to learn and explore. Then I jumped onto their [slack](http://slack.layer5.io/) and got even \nmore excited by the enthusiasm and energy of each community members welcoming me in the newcomers channel. I started attending all the community meetings and \nlearned about the project through the demos/updates from fellow contributors. Slowly and gradually, I started contributing too, then delivering updates in the \ncommunity calls, and consequently started climbing the contributor ladder.\n\nWhen I realised that I would be working on [Layer5 Cloud](https://cloud.layer5.io) and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> as an LFX intern at Layer5, then I couldn't control my excitement. \nThat excitement was to ship more impactful features for the Layer5 projects, work and engage more deeply with the engineering team at Layer5 and have an overall \nupliftment of my development skills.  Throughout my internship I worked on several features. Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding \n[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">performance tests</Link>, \nsupporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, persisting <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with \nLayer5 Cloud, migrating Layer5 Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Layer5 Cloud and exposing performance profiles \n(generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) \nthrough a public facing API.\n\nIn terms of the learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past three months overpowers the education I received in the last two years of college, \nif we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. \nI learned and applied the tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, and NextJS to Postgres, SQL, and GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I got introduced to the topics like \nperformance engineering, service meshes, networking, and several cloud-native tool. While at the same time, I met several experienced developers who are very involved in \nthe communities which revolve around these realms.\n\nOne of the major realizations I got through this internship was that it is okay to make mistakes. There were a few instances where I made mistakes. \nFor instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query which depressed the whole production instance of Layer5 Cloud, which means no one would be able \nto log into Meshery until that gets fixed. Or once I unknowingly used an incorrect default SSH port in a workflow that failed a GitHub action responsible for \npushing the latest Layer5 Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But that was okay, and no one got mad at me, but rather I have \nalways received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I dont repeat it because that is all that matters.\n\nI had a great time as an intern @ Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PRs with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also \nlearned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also learned \nthe true meaning of team spirit. All in all, that was one of the most exquisite experiences I have ever had and ofcourse, the best internship experience \n(considering it was my first internship ever!). \n\nI will be engaged in this community and will keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"LFX Experience at Layer5 - Pranav Singh","subtitle":"An exquisite experience","date":"June 8th, 2022","author":"Pranav Singh","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/41f72/lfx-pranav.webp 125w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/8be43/lfx-pranav.webp 250w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":484.00000000000006}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/lfx-experience-at-layer5-pranav-singh"}},{"id":"e571c9fa-1328-5acc-83ac-3c6d1a39b088","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport cblogo from \"./cblogo.webp\";\nimport smiLogo from \"./smi.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={cblogo} alt=\"community-bridge-logo\"/>\n\nMy journey into service meshes began on April 27, 2020 when I was selected to be a mentee under the banner of Community Bridge for the Summer of 2020. The Community Bridge Mentorship is a structured remote learning opportunity for aspiring open source software developers. The projects they host are mentored by experienced open source project developers and maintainers.\n\n<h4> Stumbling into Service Mesh Interface (SMI) </h4>\n\nI began working on SMI Conformance testing under the guidance of Lee Calcote, Founder of Layer5, in February 2020. Since then, my path into the world of service meshes has brought me an avalanche of opportunities and has helped me grow by leaps and bounds as a developer.\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a standard interface that encapsulates various common service mesh functionalities. It explains several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), their configuration variables, and their corresponding effect on the service mesh underneath in full detail. What makes SMI vital is that these CRDs are generic, and the specifications are implemented and actively followed up by various service meshes. Some of these service meshes have developed adapters that define SMI CRDs as a wrapper over the APIs they already provide, instead of adhering to the SMI spec internally. SMI specifications address essential features for the most common service mesh use cases:\n\n<img className=\"image-right\" src={smiLogo} alt=\"smi-logo\"/>\n\n- Traffic policy – To apply policies like identity and transport encryption across services\n- Traffic telemetry – To capture key metrics like error rate and latency between services\n- Traffic management – To shift traffic between different services\n\nHowever, at the moment, no service meshes adhere to the SMI specifications completely. Service meshes are rapidly developing and making active efforts to extend their feature set. Simultaneously, SMI has also been working towards adding more features to its specifications.\n\nConsequently, it becomes a necessity for continual validation of service mesh conformance with respect to SMI specifications and  the various versions of those specifications. The process of verifying conformance needs to be standardized and tooling made available.  Hence, our project efforts to create an SMI conformance tool.\n\n<h4> Meshery to the Rescue </h4>\n\nMeshery is the multi-service mesh management plane, offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. It is closely connected to the Kubernetes cluster and allows easy deployment of various service meshes and sample applications onto those meshes. Meshery enables operators to run performance tests on workloads, collect, store, and manage the test results.\n\n\nWe had found our solution. By leveraging the features provided in Meshery, we would be able to focus on the conformance validation and testing instead of sweating over the complexity in deployments. We can also use the performance management infrastructure to manage the conformance tests and their results. And so,  the tool will be developed as an integral part of Meshery to aid and abate SMI conformance woes.\nWe are now enhancing Meshery to automate the process of verifying conformance against a standard set of tests against a sample workload designed specifically for SMI conformance testing. By the time we’re through, this capability of Meshery will allow each project to validate its conformance to each version of the SMI specifications and will provide a detailed report.\n\n<h4> My Projects </h4>\n\nThe goals accomplished in my tenure at Layer5 are summarized as follows:\n\n1. **[Meshery Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility)** - Ported Meshery and its remote provider from using session based authentication to JWT based auth. This opened doors to:\n    - Usage of refresh tokens for longevity of sessions instead of asking user to re-login frequently.\n    - CLI based authentication (not done yet, but is on the roadmap)\n2. **[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub)** - WASM based envoy network packet filters in Rust-lang. Built a demo app demonstrating its potentials; we also built a  WASM filter which performs custom user specific rate limiting. This app was demo’ed in Dockercon 2020 under the header “Service Meshing with Docker Desktop and WebAssembly”.\n3. **[Implementing the Service Mesh Performance Specification](/projects/cloud-native-performance)** - Enhanced Meshery’s performance testing and profile management capabilities. Added support for customizing the requests made by the load generator, and added the capability of using performance test profiles in the tool.\n\nYou can find my code in the [**Learn Layer5 repository**](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/).\n\n<h4> Love for the Community </h4>\n\nI have been actively involved in the Layer5 community for a number of months now and am proud of the contributions I have made to various projects under the Layer5 banner. The Layer5 community represents an eclectic mix of geeky developers, out of the box thinkers, sassy writers and some of the most amazing people I have met so far in the open source community.  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment, and operational best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, and more. I am truly ecstatic to be a part of such an enthusiastic and welcoming community.<br/>\n\nAs you’ve made it to the end of my post, why not stick around and take a look at the amazing projects I just described? You might just find your dream project and if not, I can promise that you will at least end up becoming a part of one of the best open source communities out there.<br/>\nTo stay tuned with the progress of the project, please join us in the [Slack](http://slack.layer5.io) channel!\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CommunityBridge 2020: Teaching service meshes to be compliant","subtitle":"","date":"July 16th, 2020","author":"Kanishkar J","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/7513b/communitybridge.webp 750w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/317ed/communitybridge.webp 1080w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5233333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/92a0a/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/971ea/communitybridge.webp 125w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/88ea2/communitybridge.webp 250w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/92a0a/communitybridge.webp 500w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/2d60a/communitybridge.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":262}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/communitybridge-2020-teaching-service-meshes-to-be-compliant"}},{"id":"8e28ec79-117e-5c1c-a35f-e6716f1adde9","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport IshitaProfile from \"./ishita-kumar-profile.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={IshitaProfile} alt=\"Ishita Kumar Profile\"/>\n\nAs a graduate student at the Indiana University Bloomington, studying for my Masters in Computer Science, little did I consider that my thesis project would lead me on this amazing journey to becoming an open source contributor.\n\nMy adventure with Layer5 has been a highly informative and invigorating experience, from coming aboard as a Meshery user to becoming an open source contributor. My initial interest in Layer5 was sparked when, for a project in my Masters course, I was required to build a microservice architecture and develop a service layer on top of it.\nA basic Google search led me to a plethora of resources, which in turn led me to understand how different DevOps technologies could be compared. Comparison and selection of a cluster was my first step to deploying one on my VM cluster. Amidst the varied resources available to me, stumbling onto Layer5 and Meshery was a happy boon.\n\n## Why Meshery?\n\nFrom the beginning, Meshery proved to be an intuitive and easy-to-use application. Among other benefits, it could be implemented into my project with ease which was also a major contributing factor behind my choice of taking advantage of its features for my project thesis.\n\nThere are tons of resources online that compare different DevOps tools for your deployment, however, Meshery was the only project that actually offered a practical way of comparing your Kubernetes clusters. In just a few easy steps, I could download and deploy  Meshery into my VM instance and compare the performance of my microservice application running atop two different infrastructure configurations. It gathered various statistics on how they worked on my application.\n\nWhat really got my hooked though was Meshery's intuitive UI and the amazing open platform support, which made me strive to rise above and beyond my project goals, to truly understand and value the underlying idea.\n\n## Insights While Meshing Around\n\nWhile using Meshery to deploy both Istio and Linkerd, I came to the understanding that while Meshery uses common methods for interfacing with and managing cloud services, that Meshery is also capable of fully configuring all my infrastructure. This became apparent by how robust Meshery’s adapter for Istio is, which includes the ability to analyze and validate my deployment’s configuration against best practices. Each adapter includes a set of sample applications that makes it convenient to explore the functionality of different meshes, using the same application across them.\n\nThe behavior that was of keen interest to me, however, was that of my custom, microservices. When deploying my microservices application, Meshery helped me understand how different infrastructure was interacting with my software application.\n\nI learned that in addition to the easy integration of Meshery in my application, it also provides one of the best platforms out there to manage modern infrastructure configuration and gives you a fair assessment of your deployment, which can otherwise prove to be a daunting task.\n\nWhile presenting my findings to my class and professor, they were able to gauge the value that each piece of tech would bring into the microservice application.\n\n## Shout out to the Community\n\nThe Layer5 community has proved to be incredibly helpful in my journey. Communicating mainly through Slack channels, the community is vibrant and very welcoming. Any integration issues that arose for me were quickly and efficiently solved. <br />\nI am thankful that my experiences as a user, as well as a contributor, has allowed me to be a valued part of this wholesome group. Layer5 has truly made me understand the significance of an open source \"community\" and I’ll admit - I’m hooked. The number and variety of novel projects that are pushing the envelope of emerging technology within this community is enthralling. <br/>\nI’m here for the long-haul, so expect to hear from me again as I wrap my arms around these projects. If the suite of Layer5 projects interests you, please [join the community](http://slack.layer5.io)!  <br />\nThen, drop me a line as I work toward becoming a [MeshMate](https://layer5.io/community/meshmates).\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Meshy Journey","subtitle":"","date":"July 3rd, 2020","author":"Ishita Kumar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp 666w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5870870870870871}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/dc1cf/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/357be/ishita-kumar.webp 125w,\n/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/8d05a/ishita-kumar.webp 250w,\n/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/dc1cf/ishita-kumar.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":294}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/my-meshy-journey"}},{"id":"c95858c2-6e7f-5a8e-a41e-c069bc89b90b","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport issueImage from \"./issue.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nSeveral weeks ago, I wrote [a blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/11/15/introducing-comparative-spectrums-to-the-layer5-landscape/) about introducing \"comparative spectrum\" tools to [the Layer5 landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape)—a webpage which I have transformed multiple times, now!\n\nUp until now, the contents of each blog post I have written were centered upon a freshly-opened pull request. Shortly before writing my last post, I did open [one such pull request (layer5#238)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238). However, since my PR remains open, and since I am still working on the same issue my PR addresses, I have opted to instead push [a new commit](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/commits/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495) to the aformentioned (but, now, renamed) PR instead of creating a whole new one. This newest commit introduces a major step towards resolving the issue at hand, and will be the subject of this blog post!\n\n<img src={issueImage} alt=\"Issue\"/>\n\nThe issue at hand: [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211) - add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\n* * *\n\n_**Note:** this blog post will frequently reference [the update and documentation comment that I made](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644) to accompany my last commit to my PR. I consider this hefty comment to be an extension of this blog post, so I strongly recommend giving it a read!_\n\n* * *\n\nMy initial commit towards introducing comparative spectrum tooling did not represent a full solution. Thinking about what might constitute a full solution for the issue at hand, I came up with three criteria:\n\n## What was still needed:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nWithin [Issue #211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211), Layer5 lead developer Lee indicates [four slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6) upon which comparative spectrum graphics may be based upon. During my initial commit, I created graphics that emulated those found within the first three of those four slides, but I had yet to implement the graphic found in [the fourth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12): a table. I was also less-than-satisfied with the 'grid' design I had implemented in response to [slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p10).\n\n#### 2\\. A modular design\n\nThe designs I am implementing are meant to be used to present opinionated information. As I am not nearly knowledgeable to form opinionated comparisons between DevOps tools and related technologies, I have instead made my goal to make it as easy as possible for other Layer5 contributors to utilize the graphics (\"\\[comparative\\] spectrums\") that I am designing. Doing so would require encapsulating (templating) the spectrums I design (new and old), within their own HTML files, and providing a means to easily invoke (and customize) instances of those templates into the Landscape page.\n\n#### 3\\. Documentation\n\nBecause the templates I design are intended to be implemented and customized by other contributors, it is _especially_ critical that those contributors have access to complete and thorough documentation detailing the intended use of each templated design.\n\n* * *\n\n## What I delivered:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nAs documented in my [update comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644), I designed a table that very closely resembles that of Lee's slides. Implementing the table was interesting, as it ended up requiring [quite a few nested Liquid for-loops](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495/_includes/partials/spectrum/table.html#L23). Also as documented, I revamped the grid-based tooling and am quite pleased with the improvements made. The end result of these efforts is a complete set of comparative spectrums.\n\n#### 2, 3. A modular design and documentation\n\nThe bulk of the documentation I wrote details how to deal with the modular solution that I designed and implemented to enable comparative spectrums to be included into the Landscape page (through the use of Liquid `include` tags). The documentation speaks for itself; [check it out!](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644)\n\n## What's next?\n\nI would not have considered the documentation I delivered to be complete if I did not report on the issues still present in the work I delivered.

More specifically, my contributions concerned one specific page of that website: its [Service Mesh Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nShortly after making these contributions, I was graciously welcomed into the Layer5 community by its lead developer [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote?lang=en), who later directly approached me to assist him in furthering his vision for the Landscape page by implementing \"comparative spectrums\". Wishing to focus on my remaining two Hacktoberfest contributions at the time, I suggested surveying the interest of other potential contributors for this project. As such, an informative issue was opened:\n\n<img src={pr211} alt=\"PR 211\"/>\n\nIssue [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211): add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\nA month later, I fortunately found time enough to make some major progress into this issue.\n\n* * *\n\nThis issue is quite highly conceptual, much moreso than any other issue I have thus far worked on. I decided that the best way to approach this issue would be to focus on establishing a set of tools that could be used by more-knowledgeable contributors to later construct comparative spectrums—opinionated data visualizations. As such, my first step was to build a set of responsive graphical elements that resembled [those provided as examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6). These include:\n\n#### (1) _Sleek information cards:_\n\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><img src={card1} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    <td> or this </td>\n    <td><img src={card2} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slides 5 and 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (2) _Gradiented, labelable double-arrow banners:_\n\n<img src={arrow} alt=\"Arrow\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (3) _Graphically-augmented tables:_\n\n<img src={gtable} alt=\"Table\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 8](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12))_\n\n#### (4) _Spectrum-like graphical comparisons:_\n\n<img src={gcomp} alt=\"Comparison\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n* * *\n\n(1) Although there may exist libraries that may help construct such graphical elements, I did not want to introduce additional libraries to accomplish my work. Instead, I wanted to make good use of Layer5io's preexisting [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) library. Fortunately, Materialize strongly supports the design of card-like structures, allowing me to more easily [implement some](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-20fc098534d6aab31ad8e5c9db51bde0R10).\n\n(2) Unfortunately, it does not seem that Materialize supports the creation of graphical arrows, so I just ended up [styling my own](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R2).\n\n(3) These tables can be quite easily implemented and styled with or without the use of `<table>` tags. I anticipate these will be given a proper fleshing out after the other graphical elements are further developed.\n\n(4) These unique spectrum graphics present the most challenging, of all the comparison tools, to implement. Snaking spectrum bar aside, I needed to develop a _responsive_ solution that (a) allowed contributors to programmatically place image thumbnails at preset horizontal positions, while (b) ensuring those thumbnails placed at the same position do not overlap with one another (and instead align vertically atop each other).\n\nThis presented a problem to solve: I required a means to 'float' elements toward a horizontal line; to 'stack' thumbnails atop one another, without overlap, if they are given the same horizontal position. After researching quite deeply into potential solutions to this problem, I ended up stumbling across some CSS property-value pairings that I had never heard of before: [`display: grid`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [`grid-auto-flow: row dense`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid-auto-flow.asp). Miraculously, I discovered that these could actually function as [a basis for a solution](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R76).\n\n* * *\n\nAfter styling the graphical elements, I continued the website's trend of using [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid) tags (e.g. [`for`](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/iteration-tags#for)) and [YAML lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) to help modularize my solutions, which should aid future contributors in generalizing them.\n\n* * *\n\nI opened [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238) to share my work as well as invite collaboration:\n\n<img src={pr2112} alt=\"PR 211-2\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): description of tooling introduced\n\n<img src={image21} alt=\"Image\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): example images of tooling introduced\n\nThe pull request was quite well-recieved:\n\n<img src={comment} alt=\"Comment\"/>\n\n[Comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-554181763) by Layer5 team lead on pull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238)\n\nAs I mentioned in a recent Layer5 community meeting, I am very excited to continue working with Layer5; to refine and expand upon this set of new, visionary tooling for their landscape!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Comparative Spectrums to the Layer5 Landscape","subtitle":"","date":"November 15th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9805825242718447}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/33b75/landscape_green.webp 52w,\n/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/d7c02/landscape_green.webp 103w,\n/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"(min-width: 206px) 206px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":490.2912621359223}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/introducing-comparative-spectrums-to-the-layer5-landscape"}},{"id":"c8e6f627-3928-5937-8cef-5afff4fdcc96","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n(ICYMI: [I've made my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/)!)_\n\n[Hacktoberfest 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is now well underway, and I am happy to report that I have made my second contribution to my new favorite open source community, [**Layer5**](https://layer5.io/) ([on GitHub](https://github.com/layer5io))!\n\n_Before I continue on, I want to extend a huge thank-you to Layer5's lead developer, Lee Calcote, as well as the Layer5 community managers for welcoming me into the Layer5 Slack channel, allowing me to introduce myself in their weekly community meeting, and even giving my blog [an awesome shout out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/layer5/status/1180317604168306688?s=12)!_\n\n* * *\n\nThis week, I helped resolve the very first issue that I outlined in my [Planning for #Hacktoberfest 2019](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) post:\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-4.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-4.webp?w=1024)\n\nIssue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65): enhancements for the [Layer5 Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape)\n\nAt the time I found this issue, the second requested enhancement (concerning table row coloration) [was already handled](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commit/b313268cb578e762d1212c9910b522af2869b57b) by another contributor, leaving me with two tasks:\n\n1. Implementing the specified sorting functionalities (for the three tables on the [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape))\n2. Restyling the font color of site hyperlinks (an enhancement [requested later on](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65#issuecomment-483912458) in the issue)\n\n### The strange case of Jekyll\n\nFortunately, thanks to my previous work with Layer5's website, I was already all set up with an offline development environment. However, going into my first task, I knew very little about Jekyll except how to install it.\n\n_[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)... it's got to be like React or Angular, right? I mean, all I need to do is slap in [sort](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/sort/) and [reverse filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/reverse/) and toggle them onclick, right_...?\n\n_...Wait, what's a \"static site generator\"?_\n\n* * *\n\nAfter discovering what Jekyll and Liquid actually were, I determined that I would have to resort to DOM manipulation to fully accomplish my first task. However, I did succeed in accomplishing the default sorting behaviour by enhancing the Liquid tags being used by several tables.\n\nTo do so, I followed coding style on the issue's previous contributor by encapsulating my work within a new JavaScript file in the project's assets folder: a simple bubble sort function.\n\nI chose to implement the [simplest of sorting algorithms](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js#L13) in JavaScript (which I count as study for my _Data Structures and Algorithms_ midterm):\n\n\n```js\n// Excerpted from https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js\nlet bubbleSort = () => {\n  for (i = 0; i < rows.length-1; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j < rows.length-i-1; j++) {\n      if (shouldSwap(text(j), text(j+1))) {\n        rows[j].parentNode.insertBefore(rows[j+1], rows[j]);\n        didSort = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Painting over Pumpkin Bread\n\n[Encycolorpedia.com](https://encycolorpedia.com) lists the hex color code `#fdac40` as \"[Valspar Paint Pumpkin Bread](https://encycolorpedia.com/fdac40)\". Although Layer5.io's then-difficult-to-read hyperlinks were colored `#ffa_b_40`, I'd still like to think that the second task of my second Hacktoberfest contribution was festively-themed!\n\nIn [my last blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/), I mentioned that [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com) was worth further research. Well, after some poking around, I discovered that all of Layer5.io's pumpkin-colored hyperlink styling (both deliberate, and incidental) originated from its materialize.css asset.\n\nAlthough this asset has been [frequently modified](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commits/master/assets/css/materialize.css), I was still hesitant to globally alter the site's styling (in case a return to Pumpkin Bread was desired in the future), so I instead opted to [add a new inline style tag](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209/files#diff-48443fc170100677376b7ee11324494b) to override [a styling rule](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L5149) (on top of removing the 'orange-text' class from individual anchor elements).\n\n* * *\n\nAll of the changes I've made can be viewed through [my (merged) pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209):\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request [layer5io#209](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209): resolved the remainder of issue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)\n\n* * *\n\nI am very fortunate to be so well-supported by the open source communities I have worked with so far, both on-campus and abroad. With their support behind me, I feel equipped to start learning what I need to know to resolve the next two more-difficult issues that lie ahead of me!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: Heating up!","subtitle":null,"date":"October 12th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/90996/hacktoberfestw2.webp 750w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/f5ef2/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1080w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1e91f/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1366w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1918w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5291970802919708}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/eff4c/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/c7d54/hacktoberfestw2.webp 125w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/cd25a/hacktoberfestw2.webp 250w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/eff4c/hacktoberfestw2.webp 500w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/0feda/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":265}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/hacktoberfest-2019-heating-up"}},{"id":"172f6ae5-8002-5100-a4f7-cba43f99c1be","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIn [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/), I identified three GitHub issues to kick off my participation in Hacktoberfest 2019.

[![A styling issue with a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's Landscape page.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)\n\nA styling issue affected a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nOf the three GitHub issues I've scoped out, the resolution of this styling issue (i.e. tweaking CSS) represents the simplest of tasks that I have lined up—and an ideal candidate for a first-time Hacktoberfest contribution!\n\nAs far as I could tell, no open issues concerned the styling problem that I discovered. So, as instructed both Layer5's website (and encouraged its extremely-welcoming development team), I opened _my own issue_ - [Enhance landscape categories section wrapping (#191)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191).\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)\n\n### Identifying a solution\n\nTo address this issue, I came up with the idea of realigning the category list items horizontally, transforming the poorly-behaving columns of category 'cards' into rows in a responsive and easily-scalable vertical stack.\n\nImplementating this idea proved quite simple, requiring only [a few added CSS rules](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508), which I first accomplished by tinkering with the live webpage's styling (with the help of the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) browser extension):\n\n\n```css\n.card .card-content li {\n  float: right;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n.card .card-content {\n  border-right: unset;\n  padding: 0 0 5px 0;\n}\n.card .card-content:not(:last-child) {\n  border-bottom-width: 1px;\n  border-bottom-style: dashed;\n  border-bottom-color: var(--main-dark-grey);\n}\n```\n\nThe vertical stack is implemented by the rules in the first selector: list items are floated right and assigned a fixed width, which aligns them neatly. The dashed borders and padding used to separate category lists was also adjusted to accomodate the new design (pictured below):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)\n\nThe above image is one of the [two mockups of the redesign](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508) that I produced for the consideration of the project's developers. As luck would have it, Layer5 project lead [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote) provided [a lightning-quick response](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179), welcoming a pull request to it!\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)\n\n#### Future research area: Materialize CSS\n\nI discovered that the 'cards' comprising the category section are styled using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/). I considered using this framework in my solution, but ultimately decided to opt for a simple, intuitive solution. This framework appears interesting, and would definitely merits research were this a more-involved styling task.\n\n## Implementing the solution\n\nWhile using my browser's developer tools to tinker with styling, I discovered an inline `style` tag that serviced the categories section. I determined that this tag would present the best place to add the styling rules that I wrote (following the coding style of a prior contributor).\n\nFinding the location of this `style` tag (i.e. of the \"Service Mesh Landscape\" page) in the source code was a lot more trouble than I thought it would be. After paging through too many HTML documents, I gave in and used Visual Studio's global search functionality to locate it.\n\n## Testing the solution\n\nAlthough I knew that my styling worked well when loaded from a browser extension, before I could contribute code, I needed to ensure that the styling worked equally-well when loaded inline from an HTML document. Little did I know, at that time, what I would be getting myself into...\n\n#### Ruby, Gems and Jekyll? `rvm`, `bundle` and `make`?\n\nPicking through my ~/.bash\\_history file, here is the sequence of Bash shell commands that I issued (via WSL Ubuntu) in order to execute a local copy of the layer5 website (annotated for your convenience):\n```sh\n## Install dependency packages ##\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\n## Install specific version of Ruby via Ruby Version Manager ##\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rvm\nrvm install \"ruby-2.6.3\" # install specific version of Ruby specified in Layer5's Gemfile\n                         # (Yes, it must be that exact version.)\n\n## Configure RubyGems ##\necho 'export GEM\\_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n## Install Jekyll and dependencies ##\ngem install jekyll bundler\nbundle install           # install dependencies listed in Gemfile\n\n## Execute project! ##\nmake site                # references Layer5's Makefile\n                         # alias for \"bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload\"\n```\n#### Stray thoughts on documentation\n\nReflecting back on the process, a question has stuck with me: how much should projects hold the hands of novice contributors? Setting up the means to run `make site` is not included within Layer5's [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). As such, for the most novice of contributors, like myself (who have never even heard of `make` before), setting up the prerequisite development environment presented a lengthy and piecemeal (albeit ultimately valuable) learning experience.\n\nHow much documentation is too little? Too much? How high should the bar be set for contribution? I suppose it is up to the project's community to decide upon the answers to these questions themselves (and write documentation, accordingly).\n\n## Creating a pull request\n\nAfter successfully testing and fixing the styling on my local fork, I created [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request – [Restyle landscape categories (#192)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192)\n\n...and it got merged! First Hacktoberfest contribution, completed!\n\n## Up next!\n\nI ended [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) by stating that I have yet to gain any experience with makefiles. Well, thanks to my work on Layer5, that is no longer true: I have since used a makefile (to launch a Jekyll executable)! This experience will undoubtedly save me some time with resolving [the Comcast issue I found](https://github.com/Comcast/RestfulHttpsProxy/issues/5)! However, the next Hacktoberfest issue I resolve will be [_the first one I blogged about_](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65).\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: documenting my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution","subtitle":null,"date":"October 2nd, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/25655/hacktoberfest.webp 750w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/d8caf/hacktoberfest.webp 1080w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/bbff9/hacktoberfest.webp 1366w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp 1894w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4736008447729672}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/6c533/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/8874d/hacktoberfest.webp 125w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/1db53/hacktoberfest.webp 250w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/6c533/hacktoberfest.webp 500w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/8e0b0/hacktoberfest.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":237}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution"}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Internship Programs"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1485533831","4047814605","408154852","4152005505"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/blog/category/internship-programs"}
