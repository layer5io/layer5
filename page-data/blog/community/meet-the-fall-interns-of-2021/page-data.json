Like how most people formulate what and how they will do in the uni, I also came from normalcy. In Singapore, students are aiming to get the best mark in every possible lesson in college as our grades hold a very high importance in the culture. Going back and forth between classes, planning a startup with my peers, volunteering in community clubs, I had a spectacular two years in uni.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"However, during the last summer break, I started asking myself questions. How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you\\u2019re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad. Frankly, the experience wasn\\u2019t as good as I expected. Trying to pinch my way in a Google Summer of Code project, I am overwhelmed by numerous people trying to do the same.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I thought open source would be like this all the time and it failed me. But then, I took my second chance and joined Layer5. First two weeks, I tried to familiarize myself with the project and joined in the community calls. I remember sharing my screen the first time in the community call, and it was thrilling, my hands can't stop shaking. I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don't mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty. My thoughts on open source were wrong and I realize that it's just a little badness from the overall goodness. Just like Yin Yang.

They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software. However, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn't do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community. Whenever I was assigned something, I tried to get my teeth into it as deep as I could before reaching out for help. This helped me learn a lot in a healthy way.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"There was so much happening around and I wanted to be a part of it all. So I started attending all the meetings and was able to put my finger into many pies. I soon became better at expressing my thoughts and pretty soon, I developed an interest in CI/CD practices. Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming. I learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications. However, this short span often leads to unjust outcomes.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Thus, I believe paying back for what you give to the project is a philosophy in the best faith of everyone in the long term. I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to. During the course of my internship, I'll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Meshery cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in \\\"on premise environments\\\". I'll also be collaborating with Ashish Tiwari on integrating a workflow engine with Meshery introducing best practices to be followed by management software.

I went through many programs but most of them were closed at that time, except, Meshery in LFX. I thought, this is the only choice I have, let's do it, I had nothing to lose. I applied for that program and as a prerequisite, I had to engage with the community. I looked at the community calendar and I saw that there was a newcomer's call that day and I attended it.

But the encouragement and support I got from the community for that was so wonderful .

After 1 year of getting a taste of everything from data structures, web development, databases and everything in between that a CS undergraduate comes across; I thought to call myself a Backend dev. But I still was dissatisfied and finding something interesting when I came across the concept of containerization which looked magic to me.

He explained to me what Meshery is and I was immediately drawn in because Meshery is a good vantage point to the entire CNCF ecosystem. Believe me, while working on meshery at one point or another you will run into almost all major projects under CNCF. Like for any other beginner, it was all too overwhelming but exciting at the same time. Man it's such a rush when you realize that you don't know so much stuff because then there is an open window for absorbing all that stuff. I started going through docs, blogs and CNCF talks(shit that rhymed). I still binge CNCF talks. There is a plethora of good talks for you, if you are a beginner.

Then one day I accidentally got into a WASM filter meeting(believe me,joined accidentally), got asked to add one feature and I said - \\\"yes\\\". And this is how it starts for most people. You get out of your comfort zone and say \\\"yes\\\", start learning new stuff, make mistakes, get corrected and the cycle continues. Fast forward two months, I was offered an internship.From what I have learnt as a person who started late is that you only need two things- \\\"Curiosity\\\" to ask questions out of your comfort zone and \\\"Resilience\\\" to absorb answers when they are thrown at you.
