It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed.

If you were to take a three-tiered web or three-tiered app and you think about how you're breaking out those tiers with some amount of kind of vertical scaling,  you'd probably, end up putting at least a virtual IP address out in front of the whole web tier and then you've got an app tier and a database tier because you've got multiple instances of those things. Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Henrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable.\\nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\\nHenrik\\xA0recalled\\xA0that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view\\xA0of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and\\xA0when he\\xA0first saw Meshery, his immediate\\xA0thought was, \\\"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\\\"\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Lets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: \", mdx(Link, {\n    to: \"/service-mesh-management/meshery\",\n    mdxType: \"Link\"\n  }, \"Meshery\"), \".\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Meshery\"), \"If you were on a pager and were\\xA0managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and\\xA0things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff. You might soil myself if you had to go make a change in that sea of yaml. That's in part what we're working towards. There's a capability within Meshery for solving this challenge.

It has a lot of use cases for observing in kind of a read-only mode. There's a second mode to this tool: The Designer Mode.

When users drop in, they're able to go over and grab the specific capabilities of any of those service mesh adapters that are loaded for any of the versions of that mesh that they might want to design.
