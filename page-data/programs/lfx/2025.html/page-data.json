Each tutorial will include step-by-step guides, live demonstrations, and interactive labs using the Playground allowing learners to apply their knowledge directly without the hassle of any configuration.These tutorials will be reviewed by various project maintainers and then published in guides/tutorials.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Expected Outcome:\", mdx(\"ul\", {\n    parentName: \"li\"\n  }, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"10+ new solution architectures (designs) published in Meshery Catalog\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Each design is ideally adjoined with an interactive tutorial (using Meshery Playground), guiding users through infrastructure.\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Tutorials should vary in complexity, catering to beginners and advanced learners.\"))), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Recommended Skills: written English, Markdown, Kubernetes, DevOps, and hands-on experience with cloud-native tools\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Mentor(s): \", mdx(Link, {\n    to: \"/community/members/sangram-rath\",\n    mdxType: \"Link\"\n  }, \"Sangram Rath\"), \", \", mdx(Link, {\n    to: \"/community/members/lee-calcote\",\n    mdxType: \"Link\"\n  }, \"Lee Calcote\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"Issue: \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"li\",\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/14796\"\n  }, \"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues/14796\")), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ul\"\n  }, \"LFX URL: \", mdx(\"a\", {\n    parentName: \"li\",\n    \"href\": \"https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/b1fcdcd9-0066-4a9a-a879-7d5624b02727\"\n  }, \"https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/b1fcdcd9-0066-4a9a-a879-7d5624b02727\"))), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Additional information\"), mdx(\"br\", null), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Previous experience with technical writers or documentation\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our mentors have managed teams of technical writers working on documenting enterprise-grade software at large technology companies (Cisco, Seagate, SolarWinds).
