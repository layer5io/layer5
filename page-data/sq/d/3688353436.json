Passionate Backend Developer with an interest in microservices and cloud-native ecosystems. Constantly learning new things based on interest & curiosity and trying to give back as much in open-source. Other than that, I love solving algorithm problems. A side note about me would be that, once upon a time, I fell in love with mathematics and physics, which still is an ongoing affair.","image_path":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/ca16a/ashish-tiwari.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/7c3cf/ashish-tiwari.jpg 50w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/f6796/ashish-tiwari.jpg 100w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/ca16a/ashish-tiwari.jpg 200w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/874b2/ashish-tiwari.jpg 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/e0956/ashish-tiwari.webp 50w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/f8c18/ashish-tiwari.webp 100w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/7864b/ashish-tiwari.webp 200w,\n/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/98de7/ashish-tiwari.webp 400w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 200px) 200px, 100vw"}]},"width":200,"height":448}},"extension":"jpg","publicURL":"/static/e4fc011db941ab74743a122a12d90054/ashish-tiwari.jpg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/community/members/ashish-tiwari"}},{"id":"9733b2af-3eb2-5fa1-8b70-8951c0473680","frontmatter":{"name":"Ayush Khandelwal","github":"Ayush-Khandelwal-007","twitter":null,"status":"Active","meshmate":null,"linkedin":"ayush-khandelwal-741a88194","location":"Haryana, India","badges":["landscape"],"bio":"Hey there, I am a pre final year student at Indian Institute of Information Technology Allahabad ,India.
