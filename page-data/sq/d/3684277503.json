To relieve microservices headaches, several remedies are prescribed; one notable example is the use of client libraries. In microservices environments, language and framework-specific client libraries, whether pre-existing or generated, are utilized to address distributed systems challenges. Many teams first explore their path to a service mesh in these situations. The sheer volume of services that must be managed on an individual, distributed basis (rather than centrally as with monoliths) and the challenges of ensuring their reliability, observability, and security cannot be met with outmoded paradigms, necessitating the need to reincarnate prior thinking and approaches.

As a result, different service meshes are created with slightly different use cases in mind, resulting in differences in service mesh architecture and deployment models. Service meshes, which are driven by Cloud, Hybrid, On-Prem, and Edge, can enable each of these.
