If you're using Gemini CLI and finding yourself repeatedly approving the same directory prompts, this guide will help you configure trusted directories and reclaim your valuable development time.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\nThe Gemini CLI is Google's powerful command-line interface for interacting with Gemini AI models directly from your terminal. Whether you're building <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">cloud native applications</Link>, automating infrastructure tasks, or leveraging AI for code generation, the Gemini CLI can significantly enhance your productivity—but only if it's properly configured.\n\n## The Trust Prompt Challenge\n\nWhen you first run Gemini CLI in a new directory, you'll encounter trust dialogs that ask for permission to access files in that location. While this security feature protects your sensitive data, it can become a productivity bottleneck when working across multiple projects or frequently switching between directories.\n\n**The problem:** Every time you navigate to a new folder, you're interrupted by permission requests. For platform engineers and DevOps practitioners managing multiple repositories, microservices, or infrastructure-as-code projects, these interruptions add up quickly.\n\n**The solution:** Configure trusted directories once, and work uninterrupted across all your projects.\n\n## Three Ways to Configure Trusted Directories\n\nGemini CLI offers three flexible approaches to managing trusted directories, each suited to different workflows and preferences. Let's explore each method in detail.\n\n### 1. Interactive Prompts: The Quick Start Method\n\nThe most straightforward way to configure trust settings is through the interactive prompts that appear when you first use Gemini CLI in a new directory.\n\n#### How It Works\n\nWhen running Gemini CLI in an untrusted folder, you'll see a dialog with two primary options:\n\n**Trust Folder**: This option trusts only the current directory. Choose this when:\n- You're working in a single, isolated project\n- The directory contains sensitive information and you want granular control\n- You want to test Gemini CLI functionality in a specific location\n\n**Trust Parent Folder**: This option trusts the current folder and all its subdirectories. This is ideal when:\n- You're managing a monorepo with multiple projects\n- Your workspace contains related microservices\n- You want to streamline trust management across a project hierarchy\n\n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"Trusting parent folders intelligently reduces configuration overhead—one decision covers an entire project tree, letting you focus on building rather than managing permissions.\"\n  person=\"Platform Engineering Best Practice\"\n  title=\"Layer5 Community\"\n/>\n\n#### Modifying Trust Settings\n\nAlready working in a directory but want to change its trust level? No problem. Simply run:\n\n```bash\n/permissions\n```\n\nThis command brings up the interactive dialog from within your current directory, allowing you to adjust trust settings on the fly without leaving your workflow.\n\n### 2. Command-Line Multi-Directory Support\n\nFor engineers who prefer command-line efficiency or need to work across multiple unrelated directories simultaneously, Gemini CLI provides powerful command-line options for directory management.\n\n#### Starting a Session with Multiple Directories\n\nTo give Gemini CLI access to multiple directories from the start, use the `--include-directories` flag:\n\n```bash\ngemini --include-directories path/to/dir1,path/to/dir2,path/to/dir3\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- Paths can be **absolute** (e.g., `/home/user/projects/api`) or **relative** (e.g., `../frontend`)\n- Separate multiple paths with commas (no spaces)\n- This is particularly useful for cross-project workflows\n\n**Example use case:** A platform engineer working on a <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> deployment might need access to:\n- The main application repository\n- A shared Kubernetes manifests directory\n- Infrastructure-as-code configurations\n- Documentation repository\n\n```bash\ngemini --include-directories ~/projects/meshery-app,~/k8s/manifests,~/terraform/prod,~/docs/api\n```\n\n#### Adding Directories During an Active Session\n\nAlready in a Gemini CLI session and need to add another directory? Use the `/directory add` command:\n\n```bash\n/directory add <path>\n```\n\nYou can even add multiple directories at once by separating them with commas:\n\n```bash\n/directory add ~/new-project,~/shared-utils,~/config\n```\n\nThe alias `/dir` works identically for convenience:\n\n```bash\n/dir add ~/another-project\n```\n\n#### Viewing Active Directories\n\nTo see all directories currently accessible in your session:\n\n```bash\n/directory show\n```\n\nOr using the shorter alias:\n\n```bash\n/dir show\n```\n\nThis command displays a complete list of all trusted directories for the current session, helping you verify your configuration and understand the scope of file access.\n\n<div class=\"tip\">\n  <h3>💡 Pro Tip for DevOps Teams</h3>\n  <p>When working with <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/kanvas\">infrastructure design tools like Kanvas</Link>, organize your Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, and configuration files in a parent directory. Trust that parent folder once, and Gemini CLI will have seamless access to your entire infrastructure-as-code setup.</p>\n</div>\n\n### 3. Manual Configuration: The Power User Approach\n\nFor advanced users, automation enthusiasts, or those managing multiple machines, manually editing the trusted folders configuration file provides the ultimate control and reproducibility.\n\n#### Understanding the Configuration File\n\nTrusted folder rules are stored in a JSON file located at:\n\n```bash\n~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json\n```\n\nThis file resides in your home directory's `.gemini` folder and persists across CLI sessions.\n\n#### File Structure and Format\n\nThe `trustedFolders.json` file uses a straightforward JSON structure. Here's an example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"trustedFolders\": [\n    \"/home/username/projects/meshery\",\n    \"/home/username/kubernetes/clusters\",\n    \"/home/username/terraform/infrastructure\",\n    \"/opt/shared/configs\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Editing the Configuration File\n\nYou can edit this file directly using any text editor:\n\n```bash\nnano ~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json\n```\n\nOr with your preferred editor:\n\n```bash\nvim ~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json\ncode ~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json  # VS Code\n```\n\n#### Adding and Removing Paths\n\n**To add a new trusted directory:**\n1. Open the file in your editor\n2. Add the full path to the `trustedFolders` array\n3. Ensure proper JSON formatting (commas between entries, quotes around paths)\n4. Save the file\n\n**To remove a trusted directory:**\n1. Open the file\n2. Delete the line containing the path (and any trailing comma if it's the last entry)\n3. Save the file\n\n**Example workflow:**\n\n```bash\n# Backup your current configuration\ncp ~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json ~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json.backup\n\n# Edit the configuration\nnano ~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json\n\n# Verify JSON syntax (optional but recommended)\npython3 -m json.tool \"$HOME/.gemini/trustedFolders.json\" > /dev/null\n```\n\n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"Manual configuration enables version control and automation—commit your trustedFolders.json to your dotfiles repository and deploy consistent Gemini CLI settings across all your development machines.\"\n  person=\"DevOps Automation Strategy\"\n  title=\"Infrastructure as Code\"\n/>\n\n#### Applying Changes\n\nAfter editing the file, changes take effect when you:\n- Restart your current Gemini CLI session\n- Start a new Gemini CLI session\n\n**Important:** Changes to `trustedFolders.json` do **not** apply to already-running CLI sessions. Simply exit and restart the CLI to pick up your modifications.\n\n## Best Practices for Trusted Directories\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nWhile configuring trusted directories improves workflow efficiency, it's essential to maintain security best practices:\n\n1. **Be selective**: Only trust directories you actively use with Gemini CLI\n2. **Avoid overly broad permissions**: Trusting your entire home directory (`~`) exposes all files—use specific project directories instead\n3. **Regular audits**: Periodically review `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` and remove directories for completed or archived projects\n4. **Sensitive data**: Keep directories containing secrets, credentials, or PII (Personally Identifiable Information) untrusted unless absolutely necessary\n\n### Organizational Strategies\n\n**For Solo Developers:**\n- Trust parent folders for active projects\n- Use specific folder trust for exploratory or temporary work\n- Maintain a clean project directory structure to minimize trust scope\n\n**For Teams and Organizations:**\n- Standardize project directory layouts across the team\n- Document trusted directory policies in team onboarding materials\n- Consider using absolute paths in shared documentation for consistency\n- Leverage version-controlled dotfiles to distribute configuration\n\n**For Multi-Environment Workflows:**\n- Separate development, staging, and production directories\n- Apply stricter trust policies to production-related directories\n- Use environment-specific parent folders (e.g., `~/dev/`, `~/staging/`, `~/prod/`)\n\n## Integration with Cloud Native Workflows\n\nGemini CLI's trusted directories feature becomes even more powerful when integrated into cloud native development workflows. Here are practical examples:\n\n### Kubernetes and Container Development\n\nWhen working with <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Kubernetes orchestration</Link>, trust your entire K8s workspace:\n\n```bash\n# Trust your Kubernetes project root\n/permissions  # Select \"Trust parent folder\" for ~/projects/k8s-apps/\n\n# Or via command line\ngemini --include-directories ~/projects/k8s-apps,~/helm-charts,~/.kube/configs\n```\n\nThis configuration allows Gemini CLI to assist with:\n- Generating and validating YAML manifests\n- Troubleshooting deployment configurations\n- Analyzing pod logs and resource definitions\n- Creating Helm chart templates\n\n### Infrastructure as Code\n\nFor infrastructure automation with tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or Ansible:\n\n```bash\ngemini --include-directories ~/infrastructure/terraform,~/infrastructure/ansible-playbooks,~/infrastructure/scripts\n```\n\nBenefits include:\n- AI-assisted infrastructure code generation\n- Configuration validation and best practice suggestions\n- Documentation generation from IaC definitions\n- Troubleshooting infrastructure drift\n\n### Multi-Repository Projects\n\nModern cloud native applications often span multiple repositories. Configure Gemini CLI to work seamlessly across your architecture:\n\n```bash\n# Add all microservice repositories\n/dir add ~/services/api-gateway\n/dir add ~/services/auth-service\n/dir add ~/services/data-processing\n/dir add ~/services/notification-service\n/dir add ~/shared/common-libraries\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Permission Prompts Still Appearing\n\n**Problem:** You've configured trusted directories, but prompts still appear.\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Verify the exact path in `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json` matches your working directory\n2. Check for typos in paths (case-sensitive on Unix-like systems)\n3. Ensure you've restarted the Gemini CLI session after configuration changes\n4. Confirm you're working in a subdirectory of a trusted parent folder\n\n### JSON Syntax Errors\n\n**Problem:** Configuration changes aren't working, or Gemini CLI reports errors.\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Validate JSON syntax: `python3 -c \"import json; json.load(open('$HOME/.gemini/trustedFolders.json'))\"`\n2. Check for missing commas between array entries\n3. Ensure all paths are enclosed in double quotes\n4. Verify the closing bracket and brace are present\n\n### Symbolic Links and Mount Points\n\n**Problem:** Trusted directories aren't recognized when accessed via symbolic links.\n\n**Solutions:**\n1. Add both the real path and symlink path to trusted folders\n2. Use absolute paths to avoid resolution issues\n3. Check with `realpath <directory>` to find the canonical path\n\n## Maximizing Productivity\n\nWith trusted directories properly configured, you can fully leverage Gemini CLI's capabilities without interruption:\n\n- **Code generation**: Generate boilerplate, utility functions, or entire components\n- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive docs from code comments and structure\n- **Debugging**: Get AI-powered assistance analyzing logs and stack traces\n- **Refactoring**: Safely modernize codebases with intelligent suggestions\n- **Learning**: Explore unfamiliar codebases with AI-guided explanations\n\n<CTA_FullWidth \n  image={CTAImg}\n  heading=\"Design, Deploy, and Manage Cloud Native Infrastructure\"\n  alt=\"Layer5 - Cloud Native Management Platform\"\n  content=\"Explore Layer5's suite of tools including Meshery for Kubernetes management and Kanvas for visual infrastructure design.

Sticky notes, diagrams, infinite canvases—it's a designer's playground. But what happens when engineers need more than just pretty diagrams? What happens when those boxes and arrows need to actually **do something**?\n\nThat's where <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/kanvas\">Kanvas</Link> comes in.\n\nKanvas is what you get when you take the collaborative visual thinking of Miro and infuse it with the power of infrastructure-as-code, Kubernetes orchestration, and GitOps workflows. It's not just a whiteboard—it's a **complete engineering platform** for cloud-native infrastructure.\n\n## The Miro Experience (And Its Limits)\n\nLet's be fair: Miro is excellent at what it does. Teams use it to:\n- Brainstorm ideas with virtual sticky notes\n- Map out user journeys and customer experiences\n- Create wireframes and mockups\n- Run design thinking workshops\n- Collaborate asynchronously across time zones\n\nFor product designers, UX researchers, and agile teams, Miro is invaluable. The problem emerges when you try to move from **design to deployment**.\n\nPicture this: Your team has just spent two hours mapping out your microservices architecture in Miro. Beautiful diagram. Everyone's aligned. Great meeting. \n\nNow what?\n\nSomeone has to translate that diagram into YAML. Someone has to configure the ingress controllers. Someone has to set up the service mesh. Someone has to ensure the production deployment actually matches what's on the whiteboard.\n\n**The diagram and reality immediately diverge.**\n\n## The Infrastructure Gap\n\nThis gap between design and reality is what we call the **infrastructure gap**. Traditional diagramming tools create a one-way street: you design, then you implement separately. There's no connection between the visual representation and the actual infrastructure.\n\nThis leads to:\n- **Drift**: Your diagrams become outdated the moment infrastructure changes\n- **Manual Translation**: Engineers spend hours converting boxes and arrows into YAML manifests\n- **No Single Source of Truth**: Is the diagram right? Is the code right? Who knows?\n- **Limited Collaboration**: DevOps engineers can't \"play\" in the same visual space as the rest of the team because the tool doesn't speak their language\n\n## Enter Kanvas: Where Design Meets Deployment\n\nKanvas is fundamentally different. It's built on the principle of **Infrastructure as Design**—the idea that your visual representation and your actual infrastructure should be the same thing.\n\nWhen you drag a Kubernetes Deployment onto the Kanvas canvas, you're not drawing a picture of a deployment. You're **creating an actual Kubernetes deployment manifest**. When you connect two services, you're not sketching a relationship—you're **defining network policies and service meshes**.\n\n### What Makes Kanvas an Engineer's Tool\n\n#### 1. **Live Infrastructure Integration**\n\nKanvas operates in two modes:\n- **Designer Mode**: Create and design infrastructure patterns, applications, and deployments\n- **Operator Mode**: Visualize and manage your live, running infrastructure in real-time\n\nIn Operator mode, Kanvas connects directly to your Kubernetes clusters. You can see what's actually running, what's healthy, what's failing—all visually. No more `kubectl get pods` in 47 terminal windows.\n\n#### 2. **Import Existing Infrastructure**\n\nAlready have Kubernetes manifests? Helm charts? Docker Compose files? Kustomize configurations?\n\nImport them directly into Kanvas. The platform automatically converts them into visual components on the canvas, giving you instant visual insight into what you've already built. This is crucial for teams inheriting complex infrastructure or working with legacy systems.\n\n#### 3. **GitOps-Native Workflow**\n\nKanvas integrates seamlessly with GitOps workflows. Every change you make in the visual designer can be tracked, versioned, and managed through Git. Your infrastructure-as-design becomes infrastructure-as-code automatically.\n\nThis means:\n- Full audit trail of who changed what and when\n- Ability to roll back to previous infrastructure states\n- Collaboration through pull requests and code reviews\n- Consistency with your existing CI/CD pipelines\n\n#### 4. **Multi-Cluster, Multi-Cloud Management**\n\nBuilt on top of <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, Kanvas supports managing infrastructure across:\n- Multiple Kubernetes clusters\n- Different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)\n- Various service meshes (Istio, Linkerd, Consul, etc.)\n- Hundreds of cloud-native technologies\n\nYou can design once and deploy everywhere, or visualize your entire distributed infrastructure in a single pane of glass.\n\n#### 5. **Component Library with Real Infrastructure**\n\nWhere Miro gives you shapes and connector lines, Kanvas gives you **actual infrastructure components**:\n- Kubernetes Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Secrets\n- Istio VirtualServices and DestinationRules\n- Prometheus monitoring configurations\n- Database operators\n- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)\n- And thousands more from the ecosystem\n\nEach component comes with its full configuration exposed, not just a pretty icon.\n\n#### 6. **Collaboration That Scales**\n\nLike Miro, Kanvas supports multi-user collaboration. But unlike Miro, when multiple engineers are working together in Kanvas, they're not just moving sticky notes around—they're **co-authoring production infrastructure**.\n\nChanges are collaborative, but also controlled. You can share designs, publish them to the <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/catalog\">Kanvas Catalog</Link> for others to clone, and standardize deployment patterns across your organization.\n\n## Real-World Use Cases\n\n### Scenario 1: Onboarding New Team Members\n\n**With Miro:** \"Here's a diagram of our infrastructure. Good luck figuring out what's actually deployed.\"\n\n**With Kanvas:** Import your production Kubernetes manifests, visualize them on the canvas, and let new engineers explore the actual infrastructure visually. They can see relationships, configurations, and dependencies—all mapped to real resources.\n\n### Scenario 2: Designing a New Microservice\n\n**With Miro:** Sketch the architecture, export a PNG, hand it off to DevOps to implement.\n\n**With Kanvas:** Design the service architecture visually, configure the Kubernetes resources, define the service mesh policies, set up observability, and deploy—all from the same canvas.\n\n### Scenario 3: Troubleshooting Production Issues\n\n**With Miro:** Diagrams are useless. Back to the terminal.\n\n**With Kanvas:** Switch to Operator mode, see the live state of your infrastructure, identify failing components visually, and drill down into logs and metrics—without leaving the visual context.\n\n### Scenario 4: Standardizing Deployment Patterns\n\n**With Miro:** Copy-paste diagrams and hope teams implement them correctly.\n\n**With Kanvas:** Create a design pattern, publish it to the Catalog, and teams can clone and deploy it exactly as designed. Consistency guaranteed.\n\n## The Best of Both Worlds\n\nHere's the thing: **Kanvas doesn't replace the brainstorming aspect of Miro**. You can still sketch, annotate, and collaborate visually. The difference is that when you're ready to move from idea to implementation, Kanvas goes with you.\n\nYou can start with high-level architecture diagrams and progressively add detail, configuration, and deployment logic—all in the same tool. The barrier between \"design time\" and \"runtime\" dissolves.\n\n## Who Should Use Kanvas?\n\nKanvas is ideal for:\n- **Platform Engineers** building internal developer platforms\n- **DevOps and SRE Teams** managing complex infrastructure\n- **Cloud Architects** designing multi-cloud strategies\n- **Infrastructure Teams** migrating to Kubernetes\n- **Anyone** tired of YAML hell\n\nIf you're working with cloud-native infrastructure and you've wished for a better way to visualize, design, and operate it—Kanvas is your tool.\n\n## Beyond the Whiteboard: Infrastructure That Works\n\nMiro is fantastic for what it does. But when you need to design infrastructure that actually runs, deploys, scales, and operates—you need more than a whiteboard.\n\nYou need Kanvas.\n\n**Infrastructure as Design.** Not infrastructure as an afterthought.\n\nReady to see the difference? <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/kanvas\">Try Kanvas today</Link> and experience what it's like to work with a tool built for engineers, by engineers.\n\n---\n\n*Want to learn more?

You’ve pushed a change to your ConfigMap, but your application isn't seeing the new values. What's going on?\n\nThe answer depends entirely on **how your application consumes the ConfigMap**. There isn't a \"type\" of ConfigMap object itself, but rather two distinct *methods of consumption* by a Pod, and each has drastically different behavior regarding updates.\n\nTo tell what \"kind\" you have, you need to look at your Pod or Deployment's YAML definition.\n\n## How to Check Your Pod's ConfigMap Consumption\n\nYou can find out how a Pod is using a ConfigMap by inspecting its YAML definition. 🧐  Run this command to get the running YAML for a specific pod:\n\n```bash\nkubectl get pod <your-pod-name> -o yaml\n```\n\nNow, look for two key sections in the `spec.containers` list:\n\n1.  **Environment Variables:** Look for `env` or `envFrom`.\n2.  **Mounted Volumes:** Look for `volumeMounts` and the corresponding `volumes` section at the Pod spec level.\n\nLet's break down what each one means for reloading.\n\n## 1. Consumed as Environment Variables\n\nThis is when your Pod's YAML injects ConfigMap data directly as environment variables for the container.\n\n### How to Identify It\n\nIn your Pod spec, you'll see blocks like this:\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: my-app-container\n    image: my-app\n    env: # <-- Look here\n      - name: MY_CONFIG_KEY\n        valueFrom: # <-- Or here\n          configMapKeyRef:\n            name: my-special-config\n            key: some.config.key\n    envFrom: # <-- Or here\n      - configMapRef:\n          name: my-special-config\n# ...\n```\n\nIf you see `env` or `envFrom` pointing to a `configMapKeyRef` or `configMapRef`, your application is consuming the ConfigMap as environment variables.\n\n### Reload Behavior: 🛑 No Hot-Reload\n\nThis is the most critical difference: **Changes to a ConfigMap are NOT reflected in running Pods that use them as environment variables.**\n\nEnvironment variables are set by the container runtime *only when the container is created*. They are immutable for the life of that running process.\n\n**How to Apply Changes:** To make the application see the new ConfigMap values, you **must restart the Pod**. The simplest way to do this for a `Deployment` is with a rolling restart:\n\n```bash\nkubectl rollout restart deployment <your-deployment-name>\n```\n\nWhen the new Pods are created, they will read the *updated* ConfigMap data and set the new environment variables.\n\n\n## 2. Consumed as a Mounted Volume\n\nThis method mounts your ConfigMap as one or more files inside your Pod's filesystem. Your application is programmed to read its configuration from these files (e.g., `/app/config/settings.properties`).\n\n### How to Identify It\n\nYou'll see two corresponding sections in your Pod spec:\n\n1.  `spec.containers.volumeMounts`: This tells the container where to mount the volume.\n2.  `spec.volumes`: This defines the volume itself and links it to the ConfigMap.\n\n\n```yaml\n# ...\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: my-app-container\n    image: my-app\n    volumeMounts: # <-- Look here\n    - name: config-volume\n      mountPath: /etc/config\n  volumes: # <-- And here\n  - name: config-volume\n    configMap:\n      name: my-special-config\n# ...\n```\n\nIf you see this `volumes` and `volumeMounts` pairing, your application is consuming the ConfigMap as files.\n\n### Reload Behavior: ✅ Automatic... With a Catch\n\nThis method **does support hot-reloading**, but with two important caveats:\n\n1.  **There is a delay.** When you update the ConfigMap object, the `kubelet` on the node is responsible for updating the mounted files. This is not instantaneous. It relies on a periodic sync cycle, and the total delay can be **60 to 90 seconds (or even longer)** before the files at `mountPath` are actually updated.\n\n2.  **Your application must support it.** Kubernetes *only* updates the files on disk. It does **not** send a signal (like `SIGHUP`) to the process or restart the container. Your application must be built to:\n\n      * Watch the configuration files for changes (using a library like `fsnotify`).\n      * Periodically re-read the configuration files on its own timer.\n\nIf your application only reads its config files on startup, it will behave just like the environment variable method: **it will not see the changes until it is restarted.**\n\n\n## ConfigMap Reload Behavior Summary\n\nHere’s a simple table to remember the differences:\n\n| Consumption Method | How to Identify in Pod YAML | Are Changes Updated in Running Pod? | How Are Changes Seen? |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Environment Variables** | `spec.containers.env` `spec.containers.envFrom` | **No** ❌ | Pod must be **restarted**. |\n| **Mounted Volume** | `spec.containers.volumeMounts` `spec.volumes` | **Yes** ✅ (with delay) | Kubelet updates files. **Application must be coded** to reload the updated file. |\n\n### What If I Need Automatic Restarts?\n\nIf you are using the volume mount method but your application doesn't support live reloading, you can use a \"reloader\" tool. A popular open-source controller like [**Stakater's Reloader**](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) can watch for ConfigMap changes and automatically trigger a rolling restart of any Deployment that uses it. This gives you the best of both worlds: configuration in files and automatic updates for apps that can't reload on their own.\n\n<br />\n<hr />\n<br />\n\n## Skip the CLI. Power up with Kanvas\n\nAlternatively, you can skip the YAML editing and make these changes visually. That is, if you're managing your Kubernetes cluster using Kanvas. Let's break down how to use it to manage your resources, like a `ConfigMap`. \n\n## 🤔 What is Kanvas Designer?\n\n[Layer5's Kanvas](https://layer5.io/kanvas) is a powerful tool for designing, deploying, and managing your Kubernetes and Cloud infrastructure and workloads from a visual interface. Instead of writing hundreds of lines of YAML by hand, you build a **Design**. This design is a visual representation of your components (`Deployment`, `Service`, `ConfigMap`, etc.) and their relationships.\n\n## 🎨 How to Update a ConfigMap in Kanvas Designer\n\nUpdating a `ConfigMap` through the Designer follows this \"design-first\" workflow. You don't just \"edit\" the live resource in the cluster; you **update your design** and then **(re-)deploy it**.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1.  **Open Kanvas Designer:** Log in to your Kanvas UI and navigate to Designer mode (the default mode).\n\n2.  **Load Your Design:** Open the design file that contains the `ConfigMap` you want to edit. If you don't have a design yet, you can import your existing `ConfigMap` from your cluster directly onto the canvas.\n\n3.  **Find the ConfigMap Component:** On the visual canvas, find the block representing your `ConfigMap`. It will have the Kubernetes icon and the \"ConfigMap\" kind.\n\n4.  **Edit the Configuration:** Click on the component. A configuration panel will slide out, often with a 'Configure' tab or an editor icon. This will show you the key/value pairs for that *specific* `ConfigMap` resource.\n\n5.  **Deploy the Design:** Changes are automatically saved in your design as you make them. Use the **Deploy** button to send your entire design to your target Kubernetes or Cloud environment. Kanvas will calculate the difference (a \"diff\") and apply the updated `ConfigMap` manifest to your cluster. This action is the equivalent of running `kubectl` server-side apply using your design.\n\n\n## 🛑 The Most Important Part: Reload Behavior\n\nThis is critical: **Using Kanvas Designer to update a ConfigMap does NOT change how your application reloads it.**\n\nDeploying from Kanvas is just a friendly, visual way to run `kubectl apply`. The rules we discussed in our previous post about ConfigMap behavior still apply completely:\n\n  * **If your Pod consumes the ConfigMap as Environment Variables:** Your running Pods **will not** see the change. You must still restart them (e.g., `kubectl rollout restart deployment ...`).\n  * **If your Pod consumes the ConfigMap as a Mounted Volume:** The files inside the Pod **will** be updated (after the kubelet sync delay), but your application *still* needs to be smart enough to re-read that file from disk.\n\nKanvas Designer simplifies the *applying* of the change and helps you visually manage your application's state, but it doesn't change the fundamental Kubernetes behavior of *how* that change is consumed by your workloads.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How can you tell what kind of Kubernetes Configmap you have?","date":"Nov 3rd, 2025","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/image.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/87706/image.png","srcSet":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/0dee1/image.png 750w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/8beaa/image.png 1080w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/87706/image.png 1280w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/a66aa/image.webp 750w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/65dd5/image.webp 1080w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/71d4d/image.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/image.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAALCAIAAADwazoUAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAACqklEQVR42gGfAmD9APzQBffNCPbJC+S8GaKZNFlzTC5YWw89WBw9XWl8lWeAp32Polh0ill7lF6Em1aDmk2Al0d9lUZ8lEd8kgDduiDPsyq5qTmZnE9yi2RNeHZCc4U9a4XJ0dTp8f+Nr/Tr8v/T1tdsi6BtkqhgjKJRhZxIfpZGfpZFfpcAmpxUiZZgaop6UoSUW42iaJiviK3Bp73J09TVysvNqK+8vr7Av8XKk66+g6a5bpuxWY+pS4ahRIGgQYCiAFqFhlWEkk2FqFWQwHqp0a3K4ODr8d7g4dDR0t3d3eHi4dLW2cPQ2LbN2Ze7zXmrw1+cukyRtUCKtDuHtQA6eKNBfq5SjcF0pdeoyOni7fj7/P3g4+Pj5+bl6OfW4uT////u9fjH3+mgy9x8uNNep8xHm8k5k8oyj8sAMnCqQHy1XpPHjLTextrx9Pf8////5e7txeDd9vLz+fv7+Pv75PL1weLrmc/hc77aVK/YPaTZLpzdJpfhADFnnUN1qWaRvZe11c7c7fb6/f/9/snh367o4f////b6+ejw8s3k6arX4IPJ2mC92EOz2y2p4h+h6hmd8QAwWYJCaY5khKSSqL/G0d3x9Pb////T4N/T5eP////r8PHR3uCuzdGIwspkvMhFt8wss9Qard8Qpu0LovkAK0ZdO1RrV22BfY6dq7S92Nve/P398PDw7evr////3uLjr77BhqqvYqarQqmwKK+5FbLCCrDMBKreAqb1ACMyNy8+RkNTXV9td36Ij56lqdDU1eLo59PV1trb3K6ytXqHjFd9gTuFhyOWlRGnowWzqgK0qAKxrwCtzAAdIhomLis0P0NGUlhUX2ZVYGVTYGVebXFPXWJEVlpYXGJET1UwVVgfbGwPiIEEoZECspQQuIQ5uGx6ulHgG5cIXzLUqQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/87706/image.png","srcSet":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/0dee1/image.png 750w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/8beaa/image.png 1080w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/87706/image.png 1280w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/a66aa/image.webp 750w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/65dd5/image.webp 1080w,\n/static/88427231d61b05cc39b0208166c642ea/71d4d/image.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/how-can-you-tell-what-kind-of-kubernetes-configmap-you-have"}},{"id":"754ab117-0e63-5293-baa0-2009a3b8e50c","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport ReadmeAgents from \"./readme-agents.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nAI coding assistants are everywhere. They live in our terminals, they're built into our IDEs, and they've fundamentally changed how we write software. From Codex and Copilot to Gemini and Claude, developers now have a powerful new collaborator.\n\nBut, there's a problem. To be effective, these AI agents need context. They need to understand your project's architecture, coding standards, and specific rules. This guidance lives in configuration files, but every agent speaks a different language.\n\nYou might have a `CLAUDE.md` for Claude, a `.cursor/rules/` directory for Cursor, and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for Copilot, and a `JULES.md` for Google Jules. This fragmentation creates a digital Tower of Babel in your repository. When you switch tools or collaborate with a team using different agents, you're stuck translating the same core instructions into multiple formats.\n\nWhat if there was a universal translator? A single, standardized file to provide context to *any* AI coding agent?\n\nThat’s the idea behind **AGENTS.md**: an open standard for guiding AI coding agents.\n\n### What We'll Cover\n\n* **What is AGENTS.md?** The \"README for AI.\"  \n* **Why Do We Need It?** Taming the chaos of configuration files.  \n* **What Goes Inside?** A practical guide to crafting your own AGENTS.md.  \n* **Making It Work Today:** Bridging AGENTS.md with your current tools.  \n* **The Future is Unified:** What's next for AI-native development.\n\n### What is AGENTS.md?\n\nThink of it this way: README.md is the front door for human developers. It's the first place you look to understand a project's purpose, setup, and contribution guidelines.\n\n<img src={ReadmeAgents}  width=\"50%\" />\n\n**AGENTS.md is the front door for AI agents.** It’s a single, standardized markdown file in the root of your project where AI assistants can get all the context they need to become a high-performing teammate.\n\nThis simple idea is already gaining traction. With support from tools like Codex, Cursor, and Gemini CLI, AGENTS.md has been adopted by over 40,000 open-source projects.\n\n### Why AGENTS.md? The Case for a Universal Standard\n\nDevelopers are already feeling the pain of config fragmentation. On GitHub, users of tools like Claude Code and Cline have opened issues asking for a unified standard, specifically pointing to AGENTS.md.\n\nHere’s the problem without a standard:\n\n* **Tool Lock-in:** Switching to a new, better AI agent means rewriting your project's context from scratch in a new format.  \n* **Team Friction:** When your team members use different agents, your repository gets cluttered with redundant config files (.cursor/, claude.md, gemini.md), all containing slight variations of the same information.  \n* **Maintenance Nightmare:** Every time a rule changes—like updating your deployment command or linting standard—you have to update it in multiple places, hoping you don't miss one.\n\nAGENTS.md solves this by creating a single source of truth.\n\nInstead of a tangled mess of agent-specific files, you have one clean, universal file that works across all tools, which can come with its own drawbacks.\n\n### Why you might want to use multiple AI code assistant configuration files\n\nUsing multiple configuration files for an AI code assistant can offer a few benefits, most noteably is that of allowing for specialization, consistency, and tighter control in more complex projects. \n\n#### Improved project-specific customization\n\n- Tailored behavior: A configuration file can be set up for a specific project or microservice to guide the AI with project-specific settings. This ensures the AI understands the unique context, coding style, and framework of that codebase, providing more accurate and relevant suggestions.\n- Contextual awareness: For large codebases, AI assistants perform better when the code is organized into modular files. This allows the AI to process each file's context more effectively without being overloaded, leading to faster and more accurate suggestions.\n- Optimized performance: You can create lightweight configurations for smaller tasks or projects that don't require the AI to have a deep understanding of the entire codebase. This can reduce processing time and resource consumption. \n\n#### Enhanced flexibility and control\n\n- Switching models: By having multiple configurations, you can easily switch between different AI models, like Claude, GitHub Copilot, or a self-hosted model, to determine which is best for a specific task. This prevents vendor lock-in and allows you to always use the most effective tool.\n- Experimentation: Developers can experiment with different prompts, settings, and AI models by creating separate, isolated configuration files. This allows for testing and fine-tuning without disrupting the main project workflow. \n\n#### Streamlined team collaboration\n\n- Consistent guidance: A team can share a standard configuration file to ensure all members receive the same AI guidance. This helps enforce consistent coding practices, security rules, and tool usage across the entire development workflow.\n- Centralized management: Centralizing API keys and other secrets within managed configurations allows for secure collaboration. Teams can roll out pre-approved AI models and workflows while retaining oversight of their data.\n- Reduced inconsistency: A standard configuration file prevents inconsistent AI outputs that can arise when different team members use different settings or prompts, which is a major headache for Python projects and others\n\n### What's the difference between AI code assistant configuration files?\n\nTo improve the AI's relevance and prevent security issues, developers can explicitly control which parts of a codebase the AI should focus on or ignore.\n- `.aiignore`: Similar to a `.gitignore` file, this file tells the AI which files and folders to exclude from its analysis. This is critical for security, as it prevents the AI from being exposed to sensitive information.\n- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: This file contains custom instructions specifically for GitHub Copilot, guiding its behavior and code generation according to project standards or user preferences.\n- `AGENTS.md`: These files are associated with the concept of \"agents\" in AI coding, particularly with tools like GitHub Copilot's coding agent. They can define behaviors and instructions for these agents, potentially at a more granular level than the general copilot-instructions.md. AGENTS.md suggests a collection of agent definitions.\n- `CLAUDE.md`: This file serves a similar purpose to copilot-instructions.md but is specifically designed for the Claude AI model, allowing users to provide custom instructions for its interactions and code generation.\n- `.cursorrules`, `.windsurfrules`, `.clinerules`: These files, and their directory counterparts, contain configuration or rule sets for specific AI coding tools.\n\n\nREADME.md: This is a standard Markdown file used in most software projects to provide an overview, instructions, and other essential information about the project. While not directly tied to AI assistant configuration, it can implicitly guide AI tools by providing context about the codebase.\n\nThe key distinction is between files designed to configure and instruct specific AI coding assistants (e.g., Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf) and general project documentation (README.md) that provides human-readable information about the project. The AI configuration files differ based on the particular AI tool they target and the specific instructions or rules they convey to that tool.\n\n\n### What Goes Inside an AGENTS.md File?\n\nAGENTS.md consolidates the essential knowledge required to contribute to your project effectively. It's a living document that captures your team's conventions, architectural decisions, and operational knowledge.\n\nHere’s a practical example of what a robust AGENTS.md might look like:\n\n```markdown\n# AGENTS.md: Project Constitution for AI Assistants\n\n## 1. Project Overview & Core Purpose  \n- **Purpose:** This is a customer support ticketing system built with a React frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend.  \n- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL.  \n- **Key Goal:** Provide a fast, reliable, and user-friendly interface for support agents to manage customer issues.\n\n## 2. Architecture & Design Patterns  \n- **Database:** We use PostgreSQL for its reliability and ACID compliance. All business logic involving payments or user accounts must be transactional.  \n- **Caching:** Redis is used for session storage and caching non-critical data. Never cache user-private data.  \n- **State Management (Frontend):** Use React Query for server state and Zustand for global UI state. Avoid prop-drilling.  \n- **API Design:** We follow RESTful principles. All API error responses must include a \\`requestId\\` for easier debugging.\n\n## 3. Code Standards & Conventions  \n- **Formatting:** We use Prettier with the settings in \\`.prettierrc\\`. All code must be formatted on commit.  \n- **Linting:** ESLint is configured with rules in \\`.eslintrc.js\\`. Pay close attention to rules against using \\`any\\`.  \n- **Naming:**  \n    - Components: \\`PascalCase\\` (e.g., \\`TicketList.tsx\\`)  \n    - API endpoints: \\`kebab-case\\` (e.g., \\`/api/user-tickets\\`)  \n    - Functions: \\`camelCase\\` (e.g., \\`fetchUserData\\`)  \n- **Testing:** Use Jest and React Testing Library. All new components must have at least 80% test coverage for critical paths.\n\n## 4. Build, Test, & Deploy Pipeline  \n- **Local Setup:** Run \\`npm install\\` and then \\`npm run dev\\`.  \n- **Running Tests:** \\`npm test\\`  \n- **Build Command:** \\`npm run build\\`  \n- **Deployment:** Pushes to the \\`main\\` branch trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to Vercel.\n\n## 5. Common Pitfalls & API Nuances  \n- **Stripe API:** All POST requests are idempotent. It's safe to retry them.  \n- **SendGrid API:** This API has strict rate limits. All email-sending tasks should be pushed to our Redis queue.  \n- **Authentication:** If you see auth errors locally, it's likely because the Redis server died. Restart it with \\`redis-server\\`.\n\n## 6. Git & PR Workflow  \n- **Branch Naming:** \\`feature/ticket-123-add-search-bar\\`  \n- **Commit Messages:** Follow the Conventional Commits specification. (e.g., \\`feat: add user profile page\\`)  \n- **Pull Requests:** Must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging. Link the associated ticket in the PR description.\n```\n\n*Start small, and let it grow.* Your AGENTS.md doesn't need to be perfect on day one. Begin with the most critical information and expand it over time. Each time a developer (or an agent) learns something new about the project, add it to the file.\n\n### Bridging AGENTS.md with Existing Tools\n\nWhile many modern agents support AGENTS.md out of the box, some older tools still look for their own native config files. For those, you can use two simple bridging strategies to get them to read your central AGENTS.md file.\n\n#### Method 1: Symbolic Linking\n\nA symbolic link (symlink) is a pointer to another file. You can create symlinks that trick agents into reading AGENTS.md while looking for their native file.\n\nOpen your terminal in the project root and run these commands for the tools you use:\n\n<pre><code className=\"language-markdown\">\n# For Claude Code  \nln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md\n\n# For Cursor  \nmkdir -p .cursor/rules  \nln -s ../../AGENTS.md .cursor/rules/rules.mdc\n\n# For GitHub Copilot  \nmkdir -p .github  \nln -s ../AGENTS.md .github/copilot-instructions.md\n</code></pre>\n\nYour tools continue to work as expected, but now they all draw their context from a single source.\n\n#### Method 2: Using Imports\n\nSome agents support importing one markdown file into another. For example, in Claude Code's CLAUDE.md file, you can simply add a line to import your universal file:\n\n```markdown\n# In ./CLAUDE.md\n\n@AGENTS.md\n\n# You can add Claude-specific instructions below if needed\n```\n\nThis approach keeps your setup clean and ensures AGENTS.md remains the primary source of truth.\n\n#### What's the difference between agents.md and prompt.md?\n\n`AGENTS.md` and `.prompt.md` files serve different purposes in guiding an AI coding assistant. AGENTS.md provides general, project-level context, while .prompt.md files define reusable, task-specific instructions. A `.prompt.md` file defines a reusable, task-specific prompt that can be executed directly by an AI assistant. \nPurpose: Automate common, repeatable development tasks. A `.prompt.md`:\n\n- Encapsulates complex tasks: Lets you define and reuse complex, multi-step instructions for specific jobs.\n- Task specialization: Creates a specialized prompt for common tasks, such as generating a test case or scaffolding a component.\n- Chat integration: Some AI assistants, like GitHub Copilot in VS Code, allow developers to run prompt files directly from the chat interface using a slash command.\n\n**Key differences summarized**\n\n|| Aspect \t|| AGENTS.md\t|| .prompt.md ||\n| Scope\t| Project-wide | Task-specific |\n| Purpose\t| Defines general rules and project context for any task\t| Automates specific, repeatable tasks |\n| Trigger\t| Automatically referenced by the AI for every interaction\t| Manually invoked by the user, often via a chat command |\n| Content\t| High-level instructions, conventions, and setup details\t| Detailed instructions and examples for a single, focused task |\n| Analogy\t| A handbook for the AI\t| A macro or recipe for the AI |\n\n\n### What's Next: The Future of AI Collaboration\n\n`AGENTS.md` is more than just a configuration file; it's a step toward a future where AI and human developers collaborate seamlessly.\n\nImagine a world where any AI agent can clone a repository and instantly understand its context, conventions, and goals. Onboarding a new AI assistant becomes as simple as pointing it to a URL. Open-source projects can accept high-quality contributions from autonomous agents because the rules of engagement are clearly defined.\n\nThis is the future that a common standard like `AGENTS.md` enables. For now, we can use simple bridges like symlinks to make it work. But as the ecosystem evolves, expect more and more tools to adopt AGENTS.md as the default.\n\nOne file to guide them all. One file to align them. One file to bring them all and in the codebase bind them.\n\n</BlogWrapper>     \n","frontmatter":{"title":"AGENTS.md: One File to Guide Them All","date":"Oct 10th, 2025","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/readme-agents.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRt4AAABXRUJQVlA4INIAAACQBQCdASoUABQAPtFepE6oJSMiKAqpABoJZAC7IL/gxgtwliiZFtY75vb8EhnuduxtT67WAAD+0523iSp2vhGudQcqSwlMVooqbXEMhAJ2Pxy9FvRTatzsWBvdn64OyxP5Do0y6Qlv8VivPIA8F48MnVTg6HECex7bSYtBDkI+i1NKw/c+urmKsqgbPPCvPmf5JKqxXb7NnCWNIExtN+9yQ/sU8KFUBB8NTgj0z1bZeXmu89979AcVTae5s+P8gd/V2VpAwMlp4KANrnia0aQAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/67ded/readme-agents.webp","srcSet":"/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/4f03f/readme-agents.webp 750w,\n/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/67ded/readme-agents.webp 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/readme-agents.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRt4AAABXRUJQVlA4INIAAACQBQCdASoUABQAPtFepE6oJSMiKAqpABoJZAC7IL/gxgtwliiZFtY75vb8EhnuduxtT67WAAD+0523iSp2vhGudQcqSwlMVooqbXEMhAJ2Pxy9FvRTatzsWBvdn64OyxP5Do0y6Qlv8VivPIA8F48MnVTg6HECex7bSYtBDkI+i1NKw/c+urmKsqgbPPCvPmf5JKqxXb7NnCWNIExtN+9yQ/sU8KFUBB8NTgj0z1bZeXmu89979AcVTae5s+P8gd/V2VpAwMlp4KANrnia0aQAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/67ded/readme-agents.webp","srcSet":"/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/4f03f/readme-agents.webp 750w,\n/static/76c19b76901449806f78915cf47038aa/67ded/readme-agents.webp 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/ai/agentsmd-one-file-to-guide-them-all"}},{"id":"588e5316-f060-57a9-822e-236580bf73d7","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport img from \"./aabid-sofi-meshery-maintainer.jpg\";\nimport { MeetTheMaintainer } from \"../../MeetTheMaintainer.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport ForkLift from \"../../../../assets/images/app/hero/forklift.svg\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<MeetTheMaintainer>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n      Continuing in our Meet the Maintainer series, we have{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/aabid-sofi\">Aabid Sofi</Link>. Aabid is a\n    maintainer of <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery UI</Link>.\n    In this interview, we get to know Aabid a little better and learn about his\n    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Aabid, thank you for taking the time to join me today. While many people, both within and beyond the Layer5 community, have witnessed the impact of your contributions, they may not know the story behind who you are and how you became a maintainer. Could you share your journey with us? How did you discover the Layer5 community, and what inspired you to stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      My journey with Layer5 began about two years ago, during a transitional phase in my career as I was moving away from regular consulting work and exploring open source more seriously. Meshery immediately caught my eye—it had a wealth of open issues that aligned well with my skillset at the time. What truly sealed the deal, though, was the community. Everyone was incredibly welcoming and supportive, especially in the areas where I had less experience. That combination of technical opportunity and community warmth made it easy to stick around and get involved deeply.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      You’re a <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery UI</Link> maintainer. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      Frontend engineering has always been a space that excites me. While some people like to strictly divide frontend and backend work, I view engineering as the art of abstraction—building clients that interface with systems behind the scenes. I approach UI development with the same principles I’d apply anywhere else in engineering: scalability, robustness, and maintainability. Sure, JavaScript has its quirks (like any language), but that’s just part of the fun. Being a UI maintainer gives me the chance to ensure that the user-facing side of Meshery reflects solid engineering values.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      Yes, I’ve contributed to several open source projects, though none as deeply or meaningfully as I have with Layer5. This community holds a special place in my heart. It gave me a platform to grow, to sharpen my skills, and—importantly—to have my work recognized and valued. The level of engagement and collaboration here is unlike anything I’ve experienced elsewhere.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n     There are more projects here than I can count on my fingers! I’ve been actively contributing to Meshery, Meshkit, Meshery Extensions, and Sistent, among others. Each project brings unique challenges and learning opportunities, and I enjoy bouncing between them based on where help is most needed.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery UI demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      One of the coolest demos I’ve seen—and personally enjoyed showcasing—is Meshery’s capability to intelligently infer and visualize relationships between various infrastructure components. There’s always a moment of awe when users see connections and dependencies automatically materialize on the screen—it feels like magic, and it’s an incredibly powerful way to understand your system’s topology.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n  What is your favorite feature or aspect of UI in this project, and why?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      My favorite aspect of the project has been the UI—especially the collaborative and visual design features we’ve built into it. I’ve always admired tools like Google Docs and Figma for how they enable real-time collaboration and intuitive design workflows. Being part of a project that offers similar capabilities for infrastructure management is an opportunity I wouldn’t trade for anything.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      One principle I try to follow—and would recommend to others—is to not fear making mistakes or admitting when you don’t know something. Acknowledging knowledge gaps is actually a strength—it helps you grow faster. After all, you can’t fix what you don’t realize is broken. Be curious, be humble, and you’ll find your footing.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Where do you see opportunities for contributors to actively engage and contribute to UI within the Meshery and Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n    Meshery is rapidly evolving—it’s currently the 9th fastest-growing project under the CNCF umbrella. There are countless ways to get involved. Start by joining the community and introducing yourself along with your skills and interests. Community managers are great at helping contributors find the right fit.\n  At the moment, areas like Meshery’s CLI, Meshery Server, and even digital marketing are actively seeking contributions. While most of Layer5’s 100+ repositories are open, two—Kanvas and Cloud—are currently closed-source but are being actively developed by community contributors. These projects are highly collaborative, with 15+ active contributors meeting daily and nearly 100 total contributors to date.\n  The team working on these projects meets every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday at 9:00 AM Central / 7:30 PM IST via meet.layer5.io/team. Anyone with interest, a collaborative spirit, and consistent participation is warmly welcomed—even into the closed-source efforts.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Let's get to know you a bit better with some quick questions:  What's the emoji you use most often? Do you prefer movies or books? Would you consider yourself a morning person or a night owl? Over the past year, what's a project or accomplishment you're particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>😀\n      Looking at my emoji history, 🙏 and 😀 are definitely the most used—and honestly, that says a lot about this community. It’s warm, collaborative, and full of gratitude.\n    As for me, I’d say I lean toward being a night owl, and while I do enjoy both books and movies, it depends on the mood. One project I’m particularly proud of is the real-time collaboration functionality we’ve added to the UI—bringing ideas like those in Figma or Docs to infrastructure tooling has been incredibly satisfying.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Meshery UI contributors or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n      My advice is simple: pick an area that genuinely interests you—there are plenty to choose from here. You don’t need to know everything right away. Start with small, manageable issues and use them as a learning opportunity. Over time, your understanding will deepen, and so will your impact. Consistency and curiosity go a long way.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Himani:</span>\n      In other words, staying curious and consistently contributing, even in small ways at first, can build the foundation for becoming a strong Meshery UI contributor or even a maintainer over time.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aabid:</span>\n  Exactly, Himani. It’s all about building momentum. Every small contribution—whether it’s fixing a bug, improving docs, or reviewing a PR—adds up and helps you grow into the role. What matters most is the willingness to learn, adapt, and collaborate with others in the community.

Many people inside and outside of the\n    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not\n    know the backstory as to who Ian is and how you arrived at your maintainer\n    role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What inspired you\n    to stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      My journey into Layer5 began with a desire to contribute to an open source project during Hacktoberfest 2024.  I was looking for a welcoming community that was working on meaningful problems - somewhere I could operate at the intersection of what I already knew and where I wanted to grow. That's when I found Meshery and Layer5. After joining a newcomers meeting, I immediately felt it was the right fit as a place I could explore deeper cloud native topics, a new programming language like golang and contribute to the UI. What inspired me to stay was the emphasis on collaboration and developer growth. Before I knew it, I was actively contributing to Meshery and eventually invited to become a maintainer.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery UI</Link> maintainer. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      After being a contributor for some time, I looked to the maintainers as leaders that were champions of culture to guide and lift others up to contribute and grow their technical skills and leadership. I hope to be able to continue with this emphasis of helping others grow and develop.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      I have not contributed to any other open source projects. Meshery was my first open source experience!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n     I am currently focused on Meshery UI client and the supporting backend and ecosystems.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      The coolest demos I have seen always pertain to Meshery Kanvas. The interactive and intuitive UI are really cool to watch.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your favorite feature or aspect of UI in this project, and why?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      The best feature of the project is the community and being able to explore technical areas with guidance of seasoned contributors.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      My hot tip is to just start and develop a habit to keep showing up.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Where do you see opportunities for contributors to get involved within\n    Meshery and Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n     There are alot of good first issues in the UI repo. We are currently trying to mature our testing efforts around Meshery UI client with playwright. This space is a great space to learn the product and improve the user flows while increasing test coverage.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Let's get to know you a bit better with some quick questions:  What's the emoji you use most often? Do you prefer movies or books? Would you consider yourself a morning person or a night owl? Over the past year, what's a project or accomplishment you're particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>😀\n      My favorite emoji is 😀. I prefer books - the more technical the better 😀. I'm a morning person with a cup of coffee.\n    Over the past year, I feel most accomplished by trying to give back as much as I've gained. This includes efforts through code contributions, mentoring, or sharing what I've learned along the way. Being part of this community has shown me the value of collaboration, and I've made it a point to support new contributors, answer questions, and help others contribute. It's incredibly rewarding to see someone you helped gain confidence and start making meaningful contributions of their own.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Ian:</span>\n      Try to build a habit of learning, contributing and helping others.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Ian.

{ BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nOver the course of [this series](/blog/category/docker), we've embarked on a deep technical dive into Docker Model Runner, moving beyond surface-level descriptions to uncover the engineering principles and practical implications of this innovative toolkit. From its foundational architecture to its integration with the broader developer ecosystem, Model Runner presents a compelling vision for the future of local AI development. In this concluding post, we'll synthesize the key engineering takeaways and explore the promising horizons as Docker Model Runner matures.\n\n## **Key Engineering Takeaways: A Recap**\n\nOur journey has illuminated several critical aspects that define Docker Model Runner's value proposition for engineers:\n\n1. **OCI for Robust Model Management:** Model Runner's strategic adoption of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard for packaging and distributing AI models is transformative. It brings DevOps-like rigor to model lifecycle management, enabling versioning, provenance, and the use of existing container registries and CI/CD pipelines for AI models.  \n2. **Performance via Host-Native Execution:** The decision to run inference engines (like llama.cpp) as host-native processes, with direct GPU access (especially Metal API on Apple Silicon), prioritizes local performance. This minimizes latency and provides a responsive experience crucial for iterative development.  \n3. **OpenAI-Compatible API for Seamless Integration:** By offering an API compatible with OpenAI's standards, Model Runner drastically lowers the barrier to entry. Engineers can leverage existing SDKs, tools like LangChain and LlamaIndex, and familiar coding patterns with minimal friction.  \n4. **Docker Compose for Orchestrated AI Stacks:** The introduction of the provider service type in Docker Compose allows AI models to be declared and managed as integral components of multi-service applications, simplifying the orchestration of complex local AI development environments.  \n5. **Ecosystem Synergy (e.g., Spring AI):** Integrations with frameworks like Spring AI demonstrate Model Runner's ability to seamlessly fit into established development ecosystems, enabling Java developers, for instance, to easily incorporate local LLMs.  \n6. **Advanced Local Workflows & Fine-Grained Control:** Model Runner empowers engineers to execute sophisticated, multi-stage AI pipelines locally.

API Stability and Maturation:  \n   A crucial step will be the stabilization of its APIs. As noted during its Beta, APIs were subject to change. A stable API will provide the confidence developers need to build more robust and long-lasting integrations.  \n2. **Expanded Platform and Hardware Support:**  \n   * **Windows GPU Acceleration:** The full realization of performant GPU acceleration on Windows (especially for NVIDIA GPUs) will be a significant milestone, broadening its accessibility to a large segment of the developer community.  \n   * **Linux Enhancements:** While a Docker Engine plugin exists, further enhancements for Linux environments, potentially with more streamlined management features akin to Docker Desktop, will be important for server-side local development or specialized Linux-based AI workstations.  \n3. Comprehensive Custom Model Management:  \n   The ability for users to easily package, docker model push their own custom or fine-tuned models to any OCI-compliant registry, and then docker model pull and run them seamlessly is paramount. This will unlock Model Runner's full potential for organizations with bespoke AI needs, moving beyond curated public models.  \n4. Deeper Ecosystem Integrations:  \n   Expect continued and deeper integrations with:  \n   * **MLOps Tools:** Tighter connections with MLOps platforms for experiment tracking, model monitoring (even locally), and smoother transitions from local development to production deployment pipelines.  \n   * **IDEs:** More direct integrations within popular Integrated Development Environments for an even more fluid \"inner loop\" experience.  \n   * **More Inference Engines:** While llama.cpp is a strong start, the potential for a pluggable engine architecture could see Model Runner supporting a wider array of inference backends optimized for different model types or hardware.  \n5. Enhanced Observability and Debugging:  \n   As local AI workflows become more complex, improved tools for observing model behavior, debugging inference issues, and monitoring resource consumption locally will become increasingly valuable.\n\n## **The Enduring Impact: Local AI as a Standard Engineering Practice**\n\nDocker Model Runner is more than just a feature; it represents a significant step towards making local AI development a standard, accessible, and efficient engineering practice. By integrating AI model execution directly into the familiar and powerful Docker ecosystem, it lowers barriers, fosters innovation, and empowers developers to build the next generation of AI-powered applications with greater speed, control, and confidence.  \nThe journey from Beta to a fully mature product will undoubtedly bring further refinements and capabilities. However, the foundational principles and architectural choices already evident in Docker Model Runner signal a bright future for local-first AI development, driven by the needs and workflows of engineers.  \n\n*This blog post series has been based on information available about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature.

Now, we turn to a specific, yet highly impactful, synergy: how Docker Model Runner empowers **Java developers using the Spring AI framework** to seamlessly incorporate local Large Language Models (LLMs) into their applications.  \nFor Java engineers vested in the Spring ecosystem, Spring AI offers a familiar and powerful abstraction layer for interacting with various AI models. Docker Model Runner's compatibility provides a straightforward path to leverage these local models without stepping outside the conventional Spring development paradigm.\n\n## **Spring AI: Simplifying AI for Java Applications**\n\nBefore diving into the integration, it's worth briefly understanding Spring AI's mission. Spring AI aims to apply core Spring principles—such as autoconfiguration, dependency injection, and portable service abstractions—to the domain of artificial intelligence. It provides Java developers with:\n\n* **Consistent APIs:** A unified API for interacting with different AI models (both local and remote), reducing the need to learn multiple vendor-specific SDKs.  \n* **Abstraction Layers:** Components like ChatClient, EmbeddingClient, and ImageClient abstract away the underlying model provider.  \n* **Integration with Spring Boot:** Easy setup and configuration within Spring Boot applications.\n\n## **Docker Model Runner as a Local \"Ollama\" for Spring AI**\n\nSpring AI supports various AI model providers, including commercial cloud services (like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI) and self-hosted solutions (like Ollama). From Spring AI's perspective, Docker Model Runner, with its OpenAI-compatible API, effectively acts like a local, easily manageable Ollama-style endpoint.  \nWhen Docker Model Runner is active and serving a model (e.g., Llama 3, Gemma) with its API endpoint accessible (typically http://localhost:12434 or http://model-runner.docker.internal if accessed from another container), Spring AI can be configured to point to it.  \nHere's how a Java engineer benefits:\n\n1. **Simplified Configuration in Spring Boot**\n  \n   Spring AI's autoconfiguration can often detect and set up the necessary beans to interact with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. For Docker Model Runner, this typically involves setting a few properties in your application.properties or application.yml file:  \n   \n   ```java\n   \\# For Spring AI 0.8.x (or similar versions)  \n   spring.ai.openai.chat.base-url=http://localhost:12434/engines/v1 \n   \\# Or your specific DMR endpoint  \n   spring.ai.openai.chat.options.model=ai/llama3.2:1B-Q8\\_0 \n   \\# The model you want to use  \n   use  \n   spring.ai.openai.api-key=YOUR\\_DUMMY\\_API\\_KEY\\_OR\\_EMPTY\n   \\# Potentially disable API key if DMR doesn't require it strictly for local \n   ```\n\n   _(Note: The exact property names and structure might vary slightly based on the Spring AI version and whether you're configuring a generic OpenAI client or a more specific Ollama-like client type if Spring AI introduces more direct DMR support.)_  \n\n2. **Leveraging Spring AI's ChatClient and EmbeddingClient**\n\n   Once configured, developers can inject and use Spring AI's standard clients without needing to know that the underlying provider is Docker Model Runner. \n\n```java \n   import org.springframework.ai.chat.ChatClient;  \n   import org.springframework.ai.chat.prompt.Prompt;  \n   import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;  \n   import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;\n\n   @Service  \n   public class MyAiService {\n\n       private final ChatClient chatClient;\n\n       @Autowired  \n       public MyAiService(ChatClient chatClient) {  \n           this.chatClient \\= chatClient;  \n       }\n\n       public String getJokeAbout(String topic) {  \n           Prompt prompt \\= new Prompt(\"Tell me a short joke about \" \\+ topic);  \n           return chatClient.call(prompt).getResult().getOutput().getContent();  \n       }  \n   }\n```\n\n   This code remains the same whether Spring AI is talking to OpenAI's cloud API, a self-hosted Ollama instance, or Docker Model Runner serving a local model. This portability is a huge win.  \n\n3. **Seamless Local Development and Testing**\n   Engineers can develop and test AI-driven features entirely locally using their preferred Java tools and the Spring framework. Docker Model Runner handles the model serving, and Spring AI provides the clean Java interface. This speeds up iteration cycles and reduces reliance on potentially costly cloud APIs during development.  \n\n4. **Consistency with Production (Potentially)**  \n   While Docker Model Runner is primarily for local development, the abstraction provided by Spring AI means that switching to a production-grade, potentially cloud-hosted model provider for deployment can be achieved mainly through configuration changes, without altering the core application logic.\n\n## **The Bigger Picture: Local AI in Enterprise Java**\n\nThe integration with Spring AI is significant because it brings the ease of local LLM experimentation directly into the robust, enterprise-focused Java and Spring ecosystem. It allows Java teams to:\n\n* **Prototype AI features rapidly.**  \n* **Upskill on AI concepts using familiar tools.**  \n* **Conduct local, private testing of AI interactions with business data.**  \n* **Integrate AI into existing Spring Boot applications with minimal friction.**\n\nDocker's collaboration with Spring AI (as noted in some announcements) underscores a shared vision of making AI more accessible and developer-friendly across different programming environments. By ensuring Docker Model Runner presents an API that Spring AI can readily consume, both platforms contribute to lowering the barrier to entry for sophisticated AI development.  \nFor Java engineers, this means Docker Model Runner isn't just another tool; it's a key enabler for leveraging the power of local LLMs within the comfort and productivity of the Spring framework.\n\n## **Next, we'll delve into some practical, task-specific configurations and advanced use cases you can explore with Docker Model Runner, moving beyond basic chat completions.**\n\n*This blog post is based on information about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature. Features, commands, and APIs are subject to change. Configuration details for Spring AI may vary based on specific versions.*\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Spring AI: Streamlining Local LLM Integration for Java Developers","date":"May 14th, 2025","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/hero-image.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/366fe/hero-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/9b503/hero-image.jpg 750w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/321ef/hero-image.jpg 1080w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/84dcd/hero-image.jpg 1366w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/366fe/hero-image.jpg 1408w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/5f850/hero-image.webp 750w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/2c010/hero-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/5126b/hero-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/83fb1/hero-image.webp 1408w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5454545454545455}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/hero-image.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/366fe/hero-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/9b503/hero-image.jpg 750w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/321ef/hero-image.jpg 1080w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/84dcd/hero-image.jpg 1366w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/366fe/hero-image.jpg 1408w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/5f850/hero-image.webp 750w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/2c010/hero-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/5126b/hero-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/7a5be1548e7efed21a2ef4929e78a5ab/83fb1/hero-image.webp 1408w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5454545454545455}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/docker/spring-ai-streamlining-local-llm-integration-for-java-developers"}},{"id":"e9a58b6f-459e-5026-bb39-eb2ce65f1ab5","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nSo far in our [series on Docker Model Runner](/blog/category/docker), we've dissected its OCI-based model management, its performance-optimized execution architecture, and its OpenAI-compatible API. Now, we explore a feature that truly elevates its utility for engineers building complex systems: **deep integration with Docker Compose via a novel provider service type.**  \n\nFor engineers, Docker Compose is the go-to tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The introduction of the provider service type specifically for Model Runner bridges the gap between local AI model execution and the broader application stack, allowing you to define and manage AI models as integral components of your local development environment declaratively.\n\n## **Beyond CLI: Models as First-Class Services in Compose**\n\nWhile docker model run is handy for quick tests, real-world applications often involve multiple interacting services—a web frontend, a backend API, a database, and now, an AI model. Docker Model Runner's Compose integration allows you to define the AI model itself as a service within your `docker-compose.yml` file.  \n\nThe key innovation here is the provider attribute within a service definition. Here's a conceptual example based on Docker's documentation:\n\n```yaml\nservices:  \n  model\\_provider\\_service: \\# You can name this service as you like  \n    provider:  \n      type: model        \\# Specifies this is a model provider  \n      image: ai/llama3.2:1B-Q8\\_0 \\# The OCI image for the model  \n    \\# No 'build' or 'image' directives here in the traditional sense for the provider\n\n  my\\_app\\_service:  \n    build: ./app  \n    ports:  \n      \\- \"8080:80\"  \n    depends\\_on:  \n      \\- model\\_provider\\_service \\# Ensures model is ready before the app starts  \n    environment:  \n      \\# Environment variables will be injected here (see below)  \n      MODEL\\_NAME: ${MODEL\\_PROVIDER\\_SERVICE\\_MODEL}  \n      MODEL\\_URL: ${MODEL\\_PROVIDER\\_SERVICE\\_URL}\n```\n\nIn this setup:\n\n* model\\_provider\\_service doesn't run a traditional container in the same way my\\_app\\_service does. Instead, it instructs Docker Compose to leverage Docker Model Runner.  \n* Docker Model Runner, when processing this provider service, will ensure the specified image (the AI model) is pulled and made available via its host-native inference engine.\n\n## **Automatic Model Provisioning and Service Discovery**\n\nThis Compose integration brings significant benefits for engineers:\n\n1. **Declarative Model Dependencies:**  \n   * You declare your AI model dependency directly in your docker-compose.yml. Docker Model Runner handles the provisioning (pulling and preparing the model if needed) when you run docker compose up.  \n   * This is a stark improvement over manual docker model run commands or custom scripts to manage model lifecycle alongside your application stack.  \n2. **Automated Service Discovery via Environment Variables:**  \n   * This is a crucial feature for seamless integration. When my\\_app\\_service starts (after model\\_provider\\_service is ready), Docker Compose automatically injects environment variables into my\\_app\\_service.  \n   * These variables typically follow the pattern: PROVIDER\\_SERVICE\\_NAME\\_MODEL and PROVIDER\\_SERVICE\\_NAME\\_URL.  \n     * MODEL\\_PROVIDER\\_SERVICE\\_MODEL: Contains the name/tag of the model being served (e.g., ai/llama3.2:1B-Q8\\_0).  \n     * MODEL\\_PROVIDER\\_SERVICE\\_URL: Provides the URL your application should use to access the Model Runner's API endpoint for this model. This would often point to the internal DNS http://model-runner.docker.internal or a host-accessible TCP port if configured.  \n   * Your application code can then dynamically use these environment variables to configure its AI client, making the connection to the local model effortless and portable.  \n3. **Simplified depends\\_on for Startup Order:**  \n   * Using depends\\_on ensures that your application services only start after Model Runner has signaled that the model provider is ready. This prevents your application from trying to connect to a model that isn't yet available.\n\n## **Engineering Benefits for Complex AI Applications**\n\nThis declarative, integrated approach offers tangible advantages:\n\n* **Reproducible AI Development Environments:** Your entire local stack, including the specific AI model version, is defined in code (docker-compose.yml), making it easy to share, version control, and ensure consistency across development team members.  \n* **Simplified Onboarding:** New developers can get a complex AI-powered application stack running locally with a single docker compose up command.  \n* **Streamlined Local Testing of AI Features:** Test end-to-end flows involving your application logic and AI model interactions in a fully integrated local environment that mirrors how services would interact.  \n* **Foundation for Local MLOps Loops:** While focused on local development, this pattern lays a conceptual foundation for how AI models can be treated as manageable dependencies within larger application architectures, aligning with MLOps principles.\n\nBy treating AI models as discoverable services managed by Compose, Docker Model Runner significantly lowers the barrier to building and iterating on sophisticated multi-service applications that leverage local AI capabilities. This moves beyond simply running a model in isolation to truly integrating AI into your development workflow.  \nNext up, we'll explore how Docker Model Runner specifically caters to Java developers through its integration with frameworks like Spring AI, further simplifying the adoption of local AI.  \n\n*This blog post is based on information about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature.

Now, we peel back another layer to examine a critical aspect for any engineer working with Large Language Models (LLMs): **performance**. How does Docker Model Runner achieve the responsiveness needed for an efficient local development loop? The answers lie in its architectural choices, particularly its embrace of host-native execution and direct GPU access.  \n\nFor engineers, \"local\" often implies a trade-off: convenience versus raw power. Docker Model Runner attempts to bridge this gap, and understanding its performance model is key to leveraging it effectively.\n\n## **The Architectural Pivot: Why docker model run Isn't docker container run**\n\nOne of the most crucial, and perhaps initially counter-intuitive, aspects of Docker Model Runner is how it executes AI models. Seasoned Docker users might expect docker model run some-model to spin up an isolated Docker container housing the model and its inference engine. However, Model Runner takes a more direct path to prioritize local performance.  \n\nAs detailed in multiple technical breakdowns and official documentation, when you execute `docker model run`:\n\n* **No Traditional Container for Inference:** The command doesn't launch a standard Docker container for the core inference task.  \n* **Host-Native Inference Server:** Instead, it interacts with an inference server (initially built on the efficient llama.cpp engine) that runs as a **native process directly on your host machine**. This server is managed as part of Docker Desktop or the Model Runner plugin.\n\nThis is a deliberate engineering decision. Docker's own statements reveal that this approach was chosen to \"significantly improve performance by eliminating containerization overhead for resource-intensive AI workloads\" and to avoid the \"performance limitations of running models inside virtual machines.\" While Docker's traditional strength lies in containerization for isolation and portability, for the demanding task of LLM inference locally, the raw performance gains from direct host execution were deemed paramount.\n\n## **Unlocking Hardware: Direct GPU Acceleration**\n\nA major bottleneck for LLM performance is often GPU access. Docker Model Runner addresses this head-on:\n\n1. **Optimized for Apple Silicon (Metal API):**  \n   * For developers on macOS with Apple Silicon (M-series chips), Model Runner's host-native inference engine is designed to **directly access Apple's Metal API**. This provides a highly optimized path to the GPU, bypassing virtualization layers that can throttle performance. This direct access can offer a noticeable speed advantage compared to running models within a container that has to go through more layers to reach the GPU.  \n2. **Windows GPU Support on the Roadmap:**  \n   * Recognizing the diverse hardware landscape, Docker has explicitly included support for GPU acceleration on Windows platforms (primarily targeting NVIDIA GPUs) in its development plans. This is a critical feature for broadening Model Runner's appeal and utility.\n\nThis strategy of direct hardware access, especially for GPUs, is a pragmatic choice. It acknowledges that for the \"inner loop\" of local AI development—where rapid iteration and experimentation are key—minimizing inference latency is crucial.\n\n## **Intelligent Resource Management: Efficiency Under the Hood**\n\nBeyond raw execution speed, Docker Model Runner incorporates features for efficient resource utilization:\n\n* **On-Demand Model Loading:** Models are not kept in memory at all times. When you make a request to a specific model (e.g., via an API call from your application or a docker model run command), Model Runner loads it into memory \"on-demand,\" provided the model files have already been pulled locally. This means you don't necessarily have to issue a docker model run before your application can start interacting with a model.  \n* **Memory Caching with Inactivity Timeout:** Once loaded, a model remains in memory to serve subsequent requests quickly. However, to conserve system resources, models are automatically unloaded if they remain inactive for a predefined period. This inactivity timeout is **currently set to 5 minutes**. This is a practical detail that impacts how long a model stays \"warm\" and ready for immediate use during an interactive development session.\n\nThis combination of on-demand loading and inactivity-based unloading helps balance responsiveness with efficient use of your local machine's memory.\n\n## **The Engineering Trade-Off: Performance vs. Isolation**\n\nThe decision to run the inference engine as a host-native process is a clear trade-off: Docker is prioritizing local inference speed and direct hardware access over the complete process isolation typically provided by containers *for the inference step itself*. While the applications *using* the model can still be containerized and benefit from Docker's isolation, the model execution core operates closer to the metal.  \nThis architectural choice highlights Docker's commitment to making the local AI development experience as smooth and fast as possible, even if it means deviating slightly from its traditional container-centric execution model for this specific, performance-sensitive component.  \nUnderstanding this performance architecture—host-native execution, direct GPU access, and smart resource management—allows engineers to better anticipate Model Runner's behavior, optimize their local AI workflows, and appreciate the engineering decisions aimed at making local LLM development more practical and efficient.  \n\nIn our next post, we'll explore the API architecture of Docker Model Runner, focusing on its OpenAI compatibility and the various ways you can connect your applications to the local inference engine.  \n\n*This blog post is based on information about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature.

How do your applications actually *talk* to the models running locally via Model Runner? The answer lies in a thoughtfully designed API layer, with OpenAI compatibility at its core, and flexible connection methods to suit diverse development scenarios.  \n\nFor engineers, a well-defined and accessible API is paramount. It dictates the ease of integration, the reusability of existing code, and the overall developer experience when building AI-powered applications.\n\n## **The Heart of the Engine: llama.cpp and a Pluggable Future**\n\nIn its initial Beta release, Docker Model Runner's inference capabilities are powered by an integrated engine built on llama.cpp. This open-source project is renowned for its efficient execution of LLMs across various hardware, making it a solid foundation for local inference.  \n\nWhen you interact with Model Runner, you're essentially communicating with this llama.cpp-based server, which runs as a native host process. The API paths often reflect this underlying engine, for example, with endpoints structured under /engines/llama.cpp/v1/... or a more generalized `/engines/v1/...`.  \nWhile llama.cpp provides a robust initial backbone, the API path structure (e.g., `/engines/...`) hints at a potentially pluggable architecture. This is a common design pattern that could allow Docker to integrate other inference engines or model serving technologies in the future. This foresight means Model Runner could evolve to support a wider array of model types, quantization methods, or hardware acceleration frameworks without requiring a fundamental redesign of its API interaction model.\n\n## **The \"Superpower\": OpenAI-Compatible API**\n\nPerhaps the most strategically significant aspect of Model Runner's API is its **OpenAI compatibility**. This is a game-changer for several reasons:\n\n1. **Leverage Existing SDKs and Tools:** Engineers can use their existing OpenAI SDKs (Python, Node.js, etc.) and a vast ecosystem of compatible tools like LangChain or LlamaIndex with minimal, if any, code changes. This dramatically lowers the barrier to adoption.  \n2. **Simplified Migration:** If you've been developing against OpenAI's cloud APIs, transitioning to local models with Model Runner can often be as simple as changing the baseURL in your client configuration. This seamless switch accelerates local development and testing.  \n3. **Reduced Learning Curve:** There's no need to learn a new, proprietary API. The familiar OpenAI request/response structures for tasks like chat completions (`/chat/completions`) or embeddings (`/embeddings`) remain consistent. \n\nThis adherence to a de facto industry standard API is a deliberate choice by Docker to maximize interoperability and ease of integration, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than wrestling with new API paradigms.\n\n## **Connecting Your Applications: A Multi-Pronged Approach**\n\nDocker Model Runner offers several ways for your applications and tools to connect to the local inference engine, providing flexibility for different development setups:\n\n1. **Internal DNS for Containerized Applications (model-runner.docker.internal):**  \n   * **How it works:** For applications running as Docker containers themselves (e.g., a backend API service), Model Runner provides a stable internal DNS name: http://model-runner.docker.internal.  \n   * **Benefit for Engineers:** This is incredibly convenient. Your containerized service can simply target this DNS name to reach the Model Runner API, without needing to know the host's IP address or worry about dynamic port mappings. It simplifies network configuration within your Docker environment.  \n   * **Endpoint Example:** http://model-runner.docker.internal/engines/v1/chat/completions  \n2. **Host TCP Port for Direct Access:**  \n   * **How it works:** You can configure Model Runner to listen on a specific TCP port on your host machine. This is typically done via a Docker Desktop setting or a command like docker desktop enable model-runner \\--tcp \\<port\\> (e.g., port 12434).  \n   * **Benefit for Engineers:** This allows applications running directly on your host (outside of Docker containers)—such as IDEs, local scripts, or standalone Java applications using Spring AI—to connect to the Model Runner.  \n   * **Endpoint Example:** http://localhost:12434/engines/v1/chat/completions  \n3. **Docker Socket (Advanced/CLI Use):**  \n   * **How it works:** For direct interactions via the Docker API or for certain CLI scripting scenarios, the Docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock on Linux/macOS) can be used. API calls through the socket might have a specific path prefix (e.g., `/exp/vDD4.40/...` as seen in early versions).  \n   * **Benefit for Engineers:** This offers a lower-level interface, useful for automation scripts or tools that integrate deeply with the Docker daemon.\n\nThis multi-faceted approach to connectivity ensures that whether your application is containerized, running natively on the host, or interacting via CLI tools, there's a clear and supported path to communicate with the local AI models managed by Docker Model Runner.  \n\nUnderstanding these API mechanics and connection options is crucial for effectively integrating Docker Model Runner into your development workflows. It allows you to choose the most appropriate method for your specific application architecture and leverage the power of local AI models with ease.  \nIn our next post, we'll explore how Docker Model Runner integrates with Docker Compose, enabling the orchestration of complex, multi-service AI applications locally.  \n\n*This blog post is based on information about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature.

Now, let's delve into one of its foundational—and perhaps most strategically significant—aspects: its deep reliance on the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standard for managing AI models.\n\nIf you've wrestled with AI models, you know the \"messy landscape\" of model distribution. Models often arrive as loose files, tucked behind proprietary download tools, or lacking clear versioning. This fragmentation makes standardization, reproducibility, and integration into automated workflows a real headache for engineers. Docker Model Runner aims to bring order to this chaos by treating AI models as OCI artifacts, and this decision has profound implications for how you, as an engineer, can manage the entire lifecycle of your AI models.\n\n## **OCI: More Than Just docker model pull**\n\nYou might see docker model pull `ai/llama3.2:1B-Q8_0` and think it's just a convenient way to download models. But packaging models as OCI artifacts is a strategic move by Docker that goes far deeper. It aligns AI model management with the mature, robust ecosystem already built around OCI for container images.  \n\nEssentially, Docker is working to make AI models **first-class citizens within the Docker ecosystem**. This means the same trusted registries and workflows you use for your application containers can now, in principle, be applied to your AI models. Imagine the possibilities:\n\n* **Unified Workflows:** Manage, version, and distribute your AI models using the same tools and processes you already use for your containerized applications. No more separate, bespoke systems for model management.  \n* **Leveraging Existing Infrastructure:** Your existing private container registries (like Docker Hub, Artifactory, Harbor, etc.) can become repositories for your AI models. This allows you to apply the same security scanning, access control policies, and auditing mechanisms you trust for your containers directly to your AI assets.\n\n## **Engineering Benefits: What OCI Brings to Your AI Model Lifecycle**\n\nAdopting OCI for models isn't just about tidiness; it brings tangible engineering benefits:\n\n1. **Robust Versioning & Provenance:**  \n   * **How you benefit:** OCI's tagging system (e.g., :1B-Q8\\_0, :latest, :v2.1-finetuned) provides robust version control for your models. This is critical for reproducibility in experiments and ensuring stability in deployments. You can track exactly which model version was used for a particular result or release.  \n   * **Immutability:** Like container images, OCI artifacts can be treated as immutable. Once a version is tagged and pushed, it remains consistent, preventing accidental modifications and ensuring that when you pull my-model:v1.0, you always get the same bits.  \n2. **Streamlined CI/CD for ML Models:**  \n   * **How you benefit:** This is a big one. Your existing CI/CD pipelines, likely already geared to handle OCI artifacts for application builds and deployments, can be extended to manage your AI models.  \n   * **Think about it:**  \n     * Automated testing and validation of new model versions.  \n     * Triggering model deployments based on updates in your model training repositories.  \n     * Integrating model security scanning into your pipeline.  \n   * This moves you closer to comprehensive MLOps automation by leveraging familiar tools and processes.  \n3. **Enhanced Governance and Security:**  \n   * **How you benefit:** By storing models in your existing OCI-compliant registries, you can apply consistent governance. Use the same tools for vulnerability scanning on your models as you do for your container images. Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to determine who can pull or push specific models or versions.\n\n## **The Future is Custom: Pushing Your Own Models**\n\nWhile Docker Model Runner currently provides access to curated models from Docker Hub (often under the ai/ namespace or from partners like Hugging Face via hf.co/), the real power of OCI will unlock when you can easily manage your *own* custom models.  \n\nThe inclusion of commands like docker model push and docker model tag in the CLI strongly signals this future direction. Imagine:\n\n* Training or fine-tuning a model for your specific needs.  \n* Packaging it as an OCI artifact.  \n* Pushing it to your private or public OCI registry.  \n* Seamlessly pulling and running it with docker model pull your-namespace/your-custom-model:v1 and docker model run ....\n\nThis capability will be transformative, allowing you to integrate bespoke AI directly into your standardized Docker workflows, free from vendor lock-in for model storage and distribution.\n\n## **A More Cohesive AI Development World**\n\nBy embracing OCI, Docker Model Runner isn't just offering a new command; it's paving the way for a more unified and manageable AI development landscape. As an engineer, this means you can apply familiar, battle-tested DevOps principles and tools to your AI models, reducing complexity and accelerating your path from experimentation to production. This strategic choice for an open standard also offers a degree of future-proofing. As the AI ecosystem evolves, models packaged as OCI artifacts will likely be manageable by an ever-expanding array of tools and platforms that support this widely adopted standard.  \n\nIn our next post, we'll shift gears and look under the hood at Docker Model Runner's performance architecture, particularly its use of host-native execution and GPU acceleration.  \n\n*This blog post is based on information about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature.

Escalating API costs, data privacy concerns when handling sensitive information, network latency impacting iteration speed, and the desire for finer-grained control over execution environments have all highlighted the need for robust local solutions. Docker Model Runner is Docker's response to these engineering challenges, aiming to significantly streamline how we develop and test AI models locally.  \n\nThis post, the first in a series, will dissect Docker Model Runner from an engineering perspective. We'll explore its core technical value propositions and how you can leverage this new toolkit to enhance your AI development workflows.\n\n## **The Engineering Case for Local AI Development**\n\nFor engineers, the \"local-first\" approach to AI isn't just a trend; it's a pragmatic choice offering tangible benefits:\n\n* **Reduced Iteration Costs:** Experimenting with prompts, parameters, and model variations can lead to substantial API expenses. Local execution eliminates these costs during the crucial development and debugging phases.  \n* **Enhanced Data Privacy & Security:** Working with proprietary or sensitive datasets locally mitigates the risks associated with transmitting data to external services, a critical consideration for many enterprise applications.  \n* **Accelerated Development Cycles:** Eliminating network latency allows for near-instantaneous feedback, dramatically speeding up iterative tasks like prompt engineering, parameter tuning, and debugging model behavior.  \n* **Granular Environmental Control:** Local execution provides engineers with complete control over the model's runtime environment, dependencies, and specific configurations, facilitating reproducible experiments and precise debugging.\n\n## **Docker Model Runner: Key Technical Capabilities for Engineers**\n\nDocker Model Runner aims to integrate local AI model execution seamlessly into the familiar Docker ecosystem. Here are some of its core technical aspects beneficial for engineers:\n\n1. Simplified Local Inference Setup:  \n   While the \"Docker\" name might imply traditional containerization for the model itself, Model Runner takes a different architectural path for performance. It facilitates running models like ai/llama3.2:1B-Q8\\_0 or hf.co/bartowski/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-GGUF via commands such as docker model pull and docker model run. The key is that the inference itself often runs as a host-native process (initially leveraging llama.cpp), interacting with Docker Desktop or a Model Runner plugin. This design choice, which we'll explore in detail later, prioritizes direct hardware access.  \n2. Performance through Host-Native Execution & GPU Access:  \n   To tackle the performance demands of LLMs, Model Runner enables the inference engine to directly access host resources. For macOS users with Apple Silicon, this means direct Metal API utilization for GPU acceleration. Windows GPU support is also on the roadmap. This approach aims to minimize the overhead often associated with virtualized GPU access in containerized environments, offering a potential speed advantage for local development.  \n3. OpenAPI-Compatible API for Seamless Integration:  \n   One of the most significant engineering benefits is the provision of an OpenAI-compatible API. This allows you to reuse existing codebases, SDKs (like LangChain or LlamaIndex), and tools with minimal, if any, modification. For many, transitioning to a local model might be as simple as changing an API endpoint URL, drastically reducing the integration effort and learning curve.  \n4. Standardized Model Management with OCI Artifacts:  \n   Docker Model Runner treats AI models as Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifacts. This is a strategic move towards standardizing model distribution, versioning, and management, aligning it with the mature ecosystem already in place for container images. This opens the door to leveraging existing container registries and CI/CD pipelines for models, a crucial step towards robust MLOps practices. We'll dedicate our next post to a deep dive into this OCI integration.\n\n## **Beyond Single Invocations: The Potential for Local AI Pipelines**\n\nWhile running individual models is a core function, the architecture of Docker Model Runner also supports the local orchestration of more complex, multi-stage AI workflows. As detailed in examples like the Gemma 3 Comment Processing System, engineers can design and debug entire pipelines—involving synthetic data generation, categorization, embedding generation, feature extraction, and response generation—all on their local machines. This capability for end-to-end local development of AI-driven features is invaluable.\n\n## **Engineering the Future of Local AI**\n\nDocker Model Runner, even in its Beta phase (introduced with Docker Desktop 4.40, with APIs still evolving), presents a compelling toolkit for engineers looking to overcome the traditional challenges of local AI development. It offers a pathway to faster iteration, greater control, enhanced privacy, and reduced costs.  \nIn our next post, we will delve into the technical specifics of how Docker Model Runner's use of **OCI artifacts is set to revolutionize AI model management**, bringing DevOps principles to your MLOps workflows.  \n*This blog post is based on information about Docker Model Runner, a Beta feature. Features, commands, and APIs are subject to change.*\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Docker Model Runner","date":"Mar 27th, 2025","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/hero-image.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/366fe/hero-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/9b503/hero-image.jpg 750w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/321ef/hero-image.jpg 1080w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/84dcd/hero-image.jpg 1366w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/366fe/hero-image.jpg 1408w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/5f850/hero-image.webp 750w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/2c010/hero-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/5126b/hero-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/83fb1/hero-image.webp 1408w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5454545454545455}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/hero-image.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/366fe/hero-image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/9b503/hero-image.jpg 750w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/321ef/hero-image.jpg 1080w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/84dcd/hero-image.jpg 1366w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/366fe/hero-image.jpg 1408w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/5f850/hero-image.webp 750w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/2c010/hero-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/5126b/hero-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/dfd3200061f7dd06b9c2ae3283e13437/83fb1/hero-image.webp 1408w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5454545454545455}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/docker/docker-model-runner"}},{"id":"502a14e9-7bd6-5e45-867b-bd9c5f1455d7","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n**Tired of typing long Git commands?**\n\nGit is an incredibly powerful tool, but its command-line interface can sometimes feel cumbersome.

I started\n    with some smaller, more routine issues but quickly moved on to bigger\n    challenges and started getting recognized. One time, during a meeting, Lee\n    said something that stuck with me, it’s become one of my go-to quotes. He\n    was like, \"You don't start working like a maintainer after becoming one, you\n    act like a maintainer and do the work before you're promoted.\" That really\n    clicked for me. So I started thinking like a maintainer, doing the stuff\n    that isn’t always glamorous but really matters. Eventually, I took on more\n    responsibilities, and before I knew it, I became a maintainer.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      You’re a <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      Honestly, being a maintainer is about taking responsibility for a big part\n    of the project with taking care of small things too at the same time, and I\n    really enjoy that. One of my favourite things about it is that it lets me\n    think more broadly about what we’re doing. As a contributor, you often focus\n    on the details, but as a maintainer, you get to step back and see the bigger\n    picture, which is super rewarding.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      I’ve contributed to other open source projects, but I didn’t really get a\n    chance to get involved deeply. I think it’s mostly because a lot of those\n    projects don’t have an active community, which makes it tough to get\n    involved. However, when I joined Layer5, everything changed. I quickly\n    figured out how to start contributing, and the community managers were super\n    helpful and always around to give a hand. You just don’t see that kind of\n    support in a lot of other open source projects.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      Absolutely, Layer5 has a number of active open source projects, and I’ve\n    contributed to quite a few of them. But my main focus has been on Meshkit,\n    Sistent, Meshery Extensions, and, of course, Meshery itself.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      Haha good one, this year I got a chance to represent Meshery at KubeCon\n    which was really an amazing experience for me. I gave a demo of Kanvas and\n    during representation and during that I was collaborating with another user\n    which really showed Meshery’s capability.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n  What is your favorite feature in Meshery UI?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      <Link to=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</Link> is an extensible platform and I like this feature of it, it gives Meshery a whole new powerful capability to interact with various\n    technologies in the ecosystem and use it as an extension. My favourite one\n    is Kanvas, though.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      I definitely encourage you to join the meetings. They’re a great way to\n    connect with the maintainers in real time. Text chats just don’t do it\n    justice when it comes to letting them really get to know you. Video calls\n    are way better for that and give you a chance to show yourself to the\n    project leaders and maintainers.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      Where do you see opportunities for contributors to get involved within\n    Meshery and Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      Meshery is growing very fast, it is the 9th fastest growing project under\n    CNCF. There are many opportunities open for you to contribute. Start\n    with joining community, introducing yourself and sharing your skill. This\n    will help community managers to put you in right direction based on your\n    skills. All areas are consistently in need of help, including best at this\n    time to contribute like Meshery's CLI client, Meshery Server and digital\n    marketing.\n    <br/>\n    Out of a 100+ repos that the Layer5 community stewards, two are currently closed: Kanvas and Cloud. Both of these projects were created and are actively being developed by open source contributors, though. There are ~15 open source contributors who working on it now, who meet daily. New contributors in the community routinely express interest and are invited to participate, and are extremely well supported as they do. In other words, the source is currently closed (subject to change), but any community member here that shows interest, demonstrates competence and consistency of participation is readily invited to join in.\n    <br/>\n    The core team working on these two projects meets Mon, Tue, Wed, Fri at 9:00am Central / 7:30pm IST on <Link to = \"https://meet.layer5.io/team\">meet.layer5.io/team</Link>. You are most encouraged and welcome to partake.\n    <br/>\n    Between the two projects, ~100 different contributors have helped create these two project to date. \n    <Link to =\"https://layer5.io/community/handbook/repository-overview\"> This</Link> list of repositories and the expandable note on the page offers some additional context as well.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person\n    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re\n    particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      I’d definitely recommend reading 'Six Easy Pieces' by Richard Feynman. It’s\n    a fantastic book, especially if you’re a science lover like me, haha.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n      Good question, I’d say think about the long-term. People are more likely to\n    invest in you if they see you’re committed for the long term. If you seem\n    like you’re just looking for a quick win, it sends a message to the\n    maintainers that they might not want to put too much into you. And of course\n    try to make high-quality contributions; it doesn't matter if it’s small or\n    big.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Hargun:</span>\n      In other words, whether your contribution is big or small, it sounds like\n    aiming for high-quality contributions that add value to the projects is key.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Yash:</span>\n  You summarized it perfectly, yes I agree with you Hargun.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Yash.

Aisuko is a\n    maintainer of the{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\"> Meshery Adapters</Link>{\" \"}\n    project. In this interview, we get to know Aisuko a little better and learn\n    about his journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5\n    community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Aisuko, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of\n    the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may\n    not know the backstory as to who Aisuko is and how you arrived at your\n    maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What\n    made you stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      Thanks for having me here. Actually, Aisuko is my code name. My real name is Bowen Li. I love both of \n    I used to work for RancherLabs for a while, and I worked to maintain the official Helm (a third-party management tool for Kubernetes manifests) charts repo. These experiences helped me contribute to creating and maintaining Meshery Helm charts.\n    <br />\n    I like open source software, and I love contributing to the community.\n    The more you contribute, the more permission you get to help the\n    community grow and improve.\n    <br />\n    The Layer5 community is a true open source community. Everyone here can find\n    a comfortable role. I have been here since 2019 (a long time ago). I’ve seen\n    new members join and some leave. It's great to see people work together without\n    any other conditions. This is one of the ways I have fun.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      You’ve been consistently contributing to a large number of Layer5 projects\n    (Meshery adapters, mesheryctl, SMI, SMP). Layer5 has a large collection of\n    active projects. Which one are you currently focusing on? <i>Psst.</i> Also,\n    which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      Actually, the Meshery project in 2021-2022 has changed a lot. More skilled and\n    talented contributors joined the community. They are so professional and\n    active, and their hard work has made Meshery more powerful than before. For\n    instance, projects like `meshkit` and `meshsync` have grown significantly.\n    It’s great to have such a strong team working together.\n    <br />\n    Right now, I am primarily focusing on the `meshery-operator` project and\n    `meshery-linkerd`, along with fixing bugs across all the projects. I always\n    aim to make all the projects more controllable and maintain high code quality.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source projects? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I was active in the Rancher community and the Helm charts project, where I owned\n    three charts. I’m also still a maintainer of the GNU Hurd. Recently, I’ve been\n    working on contributions to Kubernetes community projects as well.\n    <br />\n    Compared to the Layer5 community, the Kubernetes community is much larger. \n    Many members are not very active, so it can be difficult to get feedback \n    on PRs and issues from inactive members.\n    <br />\n    The GNU Hurd project is unique, so there’s no need to compare it with others.\n    In the Layer5 community, we have a warm welcome for new contributors, and most\n    projects have active reviewers who provide feedback quickly.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n  Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically, though?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I have worked with many middle- and small-sized companies that wanted to migrate\n    to the cloud. It’s easy to move to Kubernetes, but it’s hard to ensure everything\n    runs smoothly. You have limited visibility into what’s happening in the cluster,\n    and service mesh solves that problem by showing real-time traffic.\n    <br />\n    Service mesh provides direct insights into traffic flows, which is its most useful feature.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Haha. Leading on from that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope\n    to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I once talked to Lee, the founder of Layer5. Due to time zone differences, we don’t\n    get many chances to discuss things directly. But I believe we don’t need to create\n    a new service mesh.\n    <br />\n    What we should do is provide third-party performance tools for existing service\n    mesh projects. We should give the choice back to the users, letting them pick the\n    service mesh that best suits their needs.\n    <br />\n    We should contribute to SMI and CNCF projects, helping to define performance standards\n    for the cloud-native industry. That’s why I’m keen on joining these communities.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Interesting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I believe we can offer a CNCF-standard performance tool for all service mesh\n    applications. We can collaborate with service mesh maintainers to define these\n    standards, which would be beneficial for end-users. It’s similar to what we did\n    with SMI.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n  What are today's challenges when working with service meshes?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      Even though service mesh has many features, it's still not always stable in production.\n    I remember that even Istio (v1.1x) couldn’t be upgraded to newer versions easily.\n    <br />\n    Additionally, we don’t often get test results from real production environments.\n    Right now, the focus is on multi-cluster service mesh capabilities, which brings\n    new challenges.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      I’ve worked with service mesh applications like Linkerd2, Istio, and OSM in development environments. OSM is my preference because it’s modular and has a simpler architecture compared to others.\n    <br />\n    From my experience, I believe that not all environments need all the features of a service mesh. Some middle or small companies may only need visibility into traffic flows without complex features like mTLS.\n    <br />\n    So, we should focus on simple architecture and features. For example, integrating traffic visualization with Ingress, so users don’t need to create new custom resources to track traffic.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Ah, while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up.\n    Cloud Native and especially the field of service meshes is evolving\n    exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging.\n    Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      People are always interested in new technology, but we are limited by time. I believe\n    that continuing to contribute to the CNCF open source community is the best way\n    to stay updated.\n    <br />\n    Articles and news may include the author’s personal opinions, and we don't always know\n    if they have strong relationships with the community. We should maintain critical thinking\n    and focus on solving real-world problems. The best way to learn is through hands-on experience.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      It’s an honor to be a maintainer of the Meshery community. The membership\n    is a reward for contributing to the community. Being a maintainer has made me\n    more enthusiastic about contributing to open source projects. It has also given\n    me confidence to contribute to other projects.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Anita:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aisuko:</span>\n      The Layer5 and Meshery communities are always welcoming to everyone.\n    New features are great, but there’s more to contributing than just code.\n    For example, writing unit tests and code comments is just as important as\n    adding new features.\n    <br />\n    One of our goals is to provide an opportunity for everyone who wants to contribute\n    to open source projects, so we need to maintain a high level of code quality.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Aisuko.

Maintainer series, we have{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/hussaina-begum\">Hussaina Begum</Link>, Staff Engineer at VMware. Hussaina\n    is a maintainer of{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery CLI</Link>. In\n    this interview, we get to know Hussaina a little better and learn about her\n    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Hussaina, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of\n    the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may\n    not know the backstory as to who Hussaina is and how you arrived at your\n    maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What\n    made you stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      I wanted to contribute to open source for a long time and finally made up\n    my mind to get into the world of open source during Hacktoberfest 2020.\n    Meshery was one of the projects I contributed to and it had a well defined\n    structure and meetings for everyone - Newcomers call, Developers call,\n    Websites (Frontend development) call, CI/CD call and Community call, etc.\n    Also, the MeshMate program where the existing Meshery maintainers help the\n    newest members to get started. Meshery project aligned with my networking\n    background and my goal towards backend development using golang. Last but\n    not the least, lighthearted jokes from Lee during the development call.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a Meshery Maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does\n    being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Lots of learning. Though I started out small in Meshery with a\n    documentation PR, Meshery community had so much knowledge to share. With\n    their support, I could start on `mesheryctl` UX improvements. I have seen many bright engineers implementing great features in Meshery. I draw inspiration from them and try to pay it forward by helping new members of the community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n    <i>Psst.</i> Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      I have contributed to mesheryctl, meshkit and meshery.io projects so far,\n    It's hard to pick one.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      The <a href=\"https://playground.meshery.io\">Meshery Playground</a> is an awesome system and a something of a hidden gem in cloud native ecosystem. I also remember the `mesheryctl perf` CLI demo I have done on the Meshery office hours from one of the Kubecon events and am proud of this. Kudos to all the contributors of `mesheryctl` command development and refactors.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What do you anticipate will be Meshery’s biggest announcement this year?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n  Meshery project moving to Incubating status! 🙂\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your favorite Meshery CLI command?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n  mesheryctl system start\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Use Slack effectively and leverage discuss forum, talk to MeshMates and\n    maintainers, they are all ears to the issues you face while starting out.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery\n    and the Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Work on the long pending `system config` CLI improvements and contribute to\n    other Meshery projects.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Interesting. Do expand on that: What do you think Meshery could offer in\n    addition to what it already does?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n  Labs designed in a way that they work with local resources.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person\n    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re\n    particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      eyes emoji. My preference is a book compared to a movie. I am a Night Owl\n    w.r.t. work, however, I use my early mornings for my fitness goals. I have\n    not been active lately, however removing dependency on CLIs in `mesheryctl\n    system config` would be something I would consider a good milestone item for\n    me.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the\n    developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      I like listening to kubernetes podcasts and I follow the internal slack\n    channels for upstream activities at VMware. Also, attending the local KCD\n    events helped me understand the latest developments across various k8s\n    projects. Being a program committee member has given me good understanding\n    of developments across a specific technology area, let it be security and\n    identity area or the world of service meshes.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Hussaina:</span>\n      Show up and attend the meetings which align with your expertise and areas\n    you would like to learn or contribute to. Make use of the Meshmates and\n    Meshery slack and discuss forums are pretty active and everyone is eager to\n    help.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Hussaina.

Maintainer series, we have{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/aadhitya-amarendiran\">Aadhitya Amarendiran</Link>. Aadhitya\n    is a maintainer of the{\" \"}\n    <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\"> Meshery CLI</Link> project. In\n    this interview, we get to know Aadhitya a little better and learn about his\n    journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Aadhitya, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Aadhitya is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      It was around the year 2020 when I was a sophomore and explored many things in the field of open source. I got to know about Meshery via the LFX program and tried applying for it, though I was a newcomer at that time. Later, I learned more about Layer5, started attending the community call, and met the community. The community members helped me a lot wherever I got stuck as a newcomer, which made me learn new things and involve myself in the project, which later helped me grow. Oh, of course, great learning sessions from Lee during development and community calls.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a Meshery Maintainer and have been for some long time now. What does\n    being a Meshery maintainer mean to you?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Three things come into my mind: Learning lots of new things, Challenging yourself to your limits and being a helpful navigator for contributors. During my time as a newcomer, I started out with a simple readme fix PR in the Meshery project, which I thought would cause less impact. But the maintainers accepted my PR though it’s a very small one. That instilled a feeling in me that I should give back to the community by helping newcomers and contributors whenever they are stuck in work.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Not a lot, but I worked on quite a few open source projects. Layer5 is one of the best places to start if you are new to open source. By being involved in the community, you will feel and understand the spirit of open source.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> have a number of active, open\n    source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them.\n    Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      I currently work on Meshery, as it piqued my interest during my initial days. I also work on the Meshery-SMP GitHub action project as well.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n     I’ve seen a lot of demos but the coolest one for me is the Meshery Docker extension where you can start and use Meshery right from DockerHub!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What is your favorite Meshery CLI Command?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n  Oof! That’s a tricky one. But my favorite one is definitely <code>mesheryctl perf</code>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  What is your hot tip for working with Meshery that others may not know?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      If you’re starting out with Meshery, make sure to use the Meshery Playground if you want to get hands-on for the first time without the need to deploy Meshery in your system. After you get the basics right, install Meshery and log in to your deployed instance. You’ll see that your designs, performance test results and configurations remain intact in your instance as if they are present exactly the same in the Playground. There’s no need to start from scratch. Just continue where you left off!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Where do you see opportunities for contributors to get involved within Meshery and Layer5 community?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n  Considering the fact that Meshery is now a part of CNCF (especially the fact that we are aiming for the Incubation status as well!), I feel that Meshery has a wide range of scope for contributors to be involved in. Whether you’re an expert or a newbie, Meshery has lots of subdomains to contribute. Documentation, Frontend, Backend, Adapters… the list goes on.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person\n    or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re\n    particularly proud of?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n     Most used emoji: 😎. I’m a morning person usually and sleep early, but sometimes I’m a night owl when it comes to intense work. I’d prefer movies compared to books as for some they clearly adapt from books. I’ve worked on refactoring the <code>mesheryctl pattern</code> command to <code>mesheryctl design</code> without losing the core features present. This took me a bit of time as I had to balance my current work as well which caused a bit of inactivity. But I managed to complete it, and I’m proud of doing such great work!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors\n    or potentially maintainers?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Make your presence stand out from the crowd even if you are a beginner, and learn as much as you can. Seek MeshMates and maintainers if you get stuck in something. Ask questions during meets or in Slack, and get feedback on your PRs, doesn’t matter if it’s big or small. Incorporate feedback and improvise. Remember, communication is the key, and be active!\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      In other words, whether your contribution is big or small, it sounds like aiming for high-quality contributions that add value to the projects is key.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Aadhitya:</span>\n      Yes, you got it right! Even the smallest contribution which creates a good impact in a project becomes a great factor in Open source. All that matters is perseverance, challenging yourself to limits and learning. Do these things right and you’ll find yourself growing in the community.\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\">\n  <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like\n    Aadhitya. Be like Aadhitya.

The primary objectives include identifying bottlenecks, measuring performance, and gaining insights into how the system operates under extreme conditions.\n\nLoad tests empower developers to:\n\n- Understand the scalability of the application\n- Identify and rectify bottlenecks\n- Ensure reliability and robustness of the application\n- Predict system behavior under varying conditions\n\n## [Meshery](https://meshery.io/) Load Generator\n\nLet's delve into Meshery, a multi-Cloud Native management plane founded by [Layer5](https://layer5.io/)—a community dedicated to open-source initiatives in network management and observability. Meshery aids developers in assessing the performance of their Cloud Native applications.\n\n Meshery boasts a comprehensive set of features, including:\n\n- Performance testing\n- Cloud Native Lifecycle Management\n- Configuration management\n\nSupporting various load generators like HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2, [Nighthawk](https://layer5.io/projects/nighthawk) and its built-in load generator, Meshery facilitates the creation of synthetic HTTP load and enables benchmarking the performance of Cloud Native applications.\nDevelopers can choose their preferred load generator for tests and benefit from the capability to run tests, providing a more comprehensive performance analysis.\n\nWith Meshery, developers can:\n\n- Manage the lifecycle of various [Cloud Native](https://play.meshery.io/) applications.\n- Conduct performance tests and compare results between across different [Cloud Native](https://play.meshery.io/) environments.\n- Apply custom or pre-defined configurations to enhance [Cloud Native](https://play.meshery.io/) functionality.\n\n\n# Load Balancing  \n\nLoad balancing is a critical technique that enhances the responsiveness, reliability, and scalability of applications by efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. In this guide, we'll explore various load balancing techniques and algorithms, shedding light on their roles, benefits, and challenges in the context of Kubernetes networking.\n\n## Introduction: The Crucial Role of Load Balancing\n\nLoad balancing plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance of internet applications by efficiently managing network traffic. Imagine a grocery store with multiple checkout lines—one open and the others closed. Load balancing is akin to opening all checkout lines,thereby reducing wait times, and improving overall efficiency.\n<br/>\n\n <figure className=\"imgWithCaption fig-right\">\n    <img src={Layer5} />\n    <figcaption>\n    Layer5\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n### How Load Balancing Works:\n\nLoad balancing involves three main components:\n\n1. **Load Balancer:** Positioned between users and application servers, it monitors incoming traffic and redirects it to the most suitable server. It can be hardware-based or software-based, with the latter running on existing infrastructure.\n\n2. **Application Servers:** These servers host applications, receiving traffic from the load balancer and serving requested content to users.\n\n3. **Users:** End-users access applications through the internet or intranet.\n\nWhen a user initiates a request, the load balancer evaluates factors such as server capacity, usage rate, and response time to determine the optimal server. This process enhances efficiency and reduces user wait times.\n\n## Benefits of Load Balancers: Performance, Reliability, and Scalability\n\n > **Improved Performance:** By distributing workloads evenly, response time and system latency are reduced.\n  \n > **Increased Reliability:** Fault tolerance is enhanced by detecting and removing failed or unhealthy servers,redirecting traffic to functional servers. \n\n >  **Enhanced Scalability:** The system's capacity can be horizontally scaled by adding more servers without impacting existing ones.\n\n > **Reduced Costs:** Efficient resource utilization avoids underutilization or overprovisioning of servers.\n\n## Load Balancing with [Meshery](https://meshery.io/)\n    \nMeshery  serves as a platform for managing various Cloud Native applications . While it doesn't directly perform load balancing directly, Meshery allows users to configure and observe load balancing within their chosen Cloud Native Adaptors. Through a unified dashboard, users can customize load balancing settings, monitor relevant metrics, and leverage observability tools to gain insights into the performance and health of load balancing features. Meshery's focus is on providing a consistent and user-friendly interface for Cloud Native Lifecycle Management, including load balancing configuration.\n\n**Adapters**\n\n  - [Istio](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/istio)\n  - [Linkerd](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/linkerd)\n  - [Consul](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul)\n  -\t[Network Service Mesh](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/nsm)\n\n\n## Types of Load Balancers in Kubernetes: Service, Ingress, and External\n\n1. **Service Load Balancing:** This basic Kubernetes tactic routes all requests to a service and directs them to matching pods. It's suitable for cluster-internal traffic but lacks advanced features like SSL termination.\n\n2. **Ingress Load Balancing:** Handling external traffic, it routes requests based on rules defined in an ingress resource. It offers more flexibility and functionality, including SSL termination and authentication.\n\n3. **External Load Balancing:** Involving external load balancers from cloud providers (AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer), it provides layer-4 or layer-7 load balancing and high availability. However, it adds complexity and additional costs.\n\n## Challenges of Load Balancing\n\nDespite its advantages, load balancing comes with challenges such as the need for careful configuration to address specific application requirements and potential complexities in managing dynamic workloads.\n\n\n## Load Balance Algorithms: Static and Dynamic\n <br/>\n\n##### Static Load Balancing Algorithms:\n\n1. **Round Robin:** Distributes requests sequentially across servers.\n  \n2. **Hash:** Distributes requests based on a key, such as client IP address or request URL.\n  \n3. **Random:** Distributes requests randomly.\n\n##### Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms:\n\n1. **Least Connections:** Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.\n\n2. **Least Response Time:** Considers active connections and average response time to determine the optimal server.\n\n3. **Least Bandwidth:** Routes requests to the server with the least traffic.\n\n## Choosing the Right Load Balancer: Tips and Considerations\n\nConsider factors like application needs, performance requirements, and scalability when selecting a load balancer—whether hardware, software, or a combination.\n<br/>\n\n## Conclusion: Empowering Applications with Optimal Load Balancing\n\nLoad balancing is a powerful technique that significantly impacts the performance, reliability, and scalability of applications. Whether distributing workloads based on static or dynamic algorithms, choosing the right load balancing strategy is crucial for delivering an exceptional user experience and optimizing resources.

As the speaker delved into the advantages of contributing to open-source projects, she highlighted the <a href=\"https://www.eddiehub.org/\">EddieHub</a> Open Source community as an inclusive and welcoming environment. And Eddie, the founder, standing out as one of the most enthusiastic and supportive open-source leaders (a big shout out to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/elliekingequal-it/\">Ellie King! </a>), igniting my interest.\nIntrigued, I delved into the community (even before the webinar ended), joined their Discord, and found the <a href=\"https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/BioDrop\">BioDrop</a> (formerly LinkFree) project, a shining example of a community-driven project, characterized by its meticulous organization and comprehensive documentation. I was pleasantly surprised by Eddie's active involvement and encouragement to get started no matter the level of contribution (yes I read the conversation history -- \"reading the room\").\nAs my understanding of the open-source community deepened and my proficiency in Python programming and understanding of DevOps grew, I felt compelled to explore opportunities where my newly acquired skills could be put to meaningful use and provide avenues for continuous improvement. This pursuit ultimately led me to encounter Meshery, nestled within the CNCF ecosystem.\nWith Meshery, I didn't just find another open source project; I found a community, a platform for learning and growth, and the perfect avenue for channelling my newfound skills and passions into meaningful contributions. And so, my journey with Meshery under the Layer5 organization began, marking the dawn of an exciting chapter in my open-source journey.\n### How to Get Started with Meshery - Making your first contributions:\nBefore we dive deeper, allow me to introduce Meshery.

With Docker as the most popular container engine and image format, but not the only runtime or format, the need for a standardized format to store and distribute container images became apparent and is why the <a href=\"https://opencontainers.org\">Open Container Initiative</a> (OCI) image format comes into play.\nThe OCI was established as a community-driven initiative to create open standards for container formats and runtimes. Its goal is to promote interoperability and ensure that containers can be used across different platforms and runtime environments. One of the key components of the OCI initiative is the OCI image format, which has been widely adopted by container registries.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\nWhy have container registries have embraced the OCI format? How does Meshery, a popular internal developer platform, leverage this format for pushing and pulling design patterns? By understanding the benefits of OCI format for container registries and Meshery's support for it, we can gain valuable insights into the advantages of using this standardized format.\n</div>\n\n## Why Container Registries Use OCI Format\n\nContainer registries play a crucial role in the container ecosystem, serving as repositories for storing and distributing container images. These images are the building blocks of containerized applications, containing everything needed to run an application, from the code to the dependencies and configurations. In recent years, container registries have widely adopted the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format as the standard for packaging and distributing container images.\n\n### Benefits of OCI Format\n\nThe adoption of OCI format by container registries offers several compelling benefits. Firstly, the OCI format provides a standardized and vendor-neutral way to package and distribute container images. This standardization ensures that images created using one container runtime can be run using a different runtime without any compatibility issues. This portability not only enhances interoperability but also encourages collaboration and innovation within the container ecosystem.\n\nSecondly, the OCI format promotes transparency and openness. It allows developers and users to inspect and understand the contents of a container image easily. By providing a clear structure for storing metadata and file system layers, the OCI format enables greater visibility into the image's composition, making it easier to identify potential security vulnerabilities or licensing issues.\n\n### Interoperability with Different Container Runtimes\n\nAnother key reason why container registries prefer the OCI format is its compatibility with various container runtimes. Since container runtimes are responsible for executing the container images, it is crucial to have a format that can work seamlessly across different runtime environments. The OCI format achieves this by defining a set of specifications that are implemented by various container runtimes like Docker, containerd, and CRI-O. This compatibility ensures that container images stored in OCI format can be executed on different runtimes, giving developers the flexibility to choose the runtime that best suits their needs.\n\n### Security and Trustworthiness\n\nSecurity is a top concern for container registries, and the OCI format offers robust security features. By adhering to the OCI format, container registries can leverage the security mechanisms provided by OCI specifications. These mechanisms include content-addressable storage, which ensures that the integrity of the image is maintained throughout its lifecycle, and digital signatures, which enable image verification and establish trust between the registry and the consumers. The use of the OCI format adds an additional layer of trustworthiness to container images, assuring users that the images have not been tampered with and come from a trusted source.\n\n## How Meshery Design Patterns Utilize OCI Format\n\n### Introduction to Meshery\n\nMeshery, an open-source service mesh management plane, has rapidly gained popularity among developers and operators for its ability to simplify and streamline the deployment, management, and observability of service meshes. One of the key features that sets Meshery apart is its utilization of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format for pushing and pulling design patterns.\n\n### Advantages of Pushing and Pulling Design Patterns in OCI Format\n\nUsing the OCI format for design patterns offers several advantages for Meshery users. Firstly, it ensures that design patterns can be easily shared and reused across different container runtimes, regardless of the specific implementation details. This interoperability simplifies the process of deploying applications on various platforms, eliminating the need for time-consuming modifications and customizations.\n\nSecondly, the OCI format enhances security and trustworthiness by providing a standardized and verifiable way to package and distribute design patterns. By utilizing cryptographic signing, developers can ensure the integrity and authenticity of the design patterns they push and pull from container registries.

{ BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nEarly last month, I got the news that I had been accepted as a UI Visual Design Intern at Layer5. Five months ago, I was a new contributor with zero knowledge of cloud native technologies roaming through their Github looking to make my first contribution. In this article, I’ll share my journey contributing to Layer5 as a designer. I’ll also share insights I hope new contributors find useful as they navigate their open source journey.\n\n### Discovery\nI first learned about Layer5 through the LFX Mentorship. I stumbled upon a tweet by [Anita Ihuman](/community/members/anita-ihuman) announcing that [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery) was accepting mentees for a design-related project. I had always been looking to make design contributions to open source projects but it was hard finding one. So, this was a great opportunity for me.\n\n### My First Contribution\nInterestingly, my first contribution to Layer5 had nothing to do with design. It was a writing task. They needed a blog that highlighted [the importance of GitHub stars](https://layer5.io/blog/community/on-the-importance-of-github-stars) to a project. The purpose of the blog was to boost the project’s visibility by encouraging more people to [give Meshery a star](https://github.com/meshery/meshery) on GitHub. Since I had some experience writing, I volunteered to write the blog. It was a bit more tasking than I had anticipated but with the help of the community, I was able to work through it.\n \n### Making Design Contributions\nI noticed there were a bunch of open issues to design badges for users and contributors. I requested to work on one of the badges and got assigned. I didn’t initially have edit access to the community Figma file so I struggled to get assets like the logo and font to create the design. I eventually found them in the local branch of Layer5 that I had cloned earlier on my PC. Turned out that all the resources I needed to complete that task were available to me; I just needed to know where to look.\n\nThat was my first design contribution. Since then I’ve designed more badges and contributed in many other ways besides design. For instance, I worked on documentation and helped with marketing and community management.\n\n### How I've Benefited\nHere’s a non-exhaustive summary of how contributing to Layer5 has benefited me:\n1. **Autonomy** - I’ve learned to own my process and see tasks from start to finish. When I volunteered to write that first blog, I thought I’d do just the writing part and someone else would get it up on the website. I didn’t realize that I would have to clone a repository, learn to use Git CMD, make commits, learn Markdown, and raise a pull request. These were all foreign to me and I was doing them for the first time. It was a great learning opportunity and I’m grateful for it.\n1. **Presentation** - We hold weekly meetings where contributors share what they’re working on and receive feedback. Presenting at these meetings has taught me to not just show my work, but to talk about it. I’m not a great orator so this was challenging for me at first but I’ve noticed that I’m getting more confident with each presentation I make. I’m gradually learning how to clearly articulate my thought process and have a valid justification for any route I choose to take to complete a task.\n1. **Design** - Making design contributions has helped improve the quality of my work. Sometimes, I’d nail a design on my first try. Other times, I may have to iterate several times before I get it right. The important thing is that I end up producing high-quality work. I’ve also learned to detach myself from my work, be objective, and gracefully accept constructive criticism.\n1. **Collaboration** - For the first time, I get to work together with developers and other designers. Thanks to Layer5.  I’m also learning to use communication and collaboration tools like Slack, GitHub, and ClickUp.\n\n### How You Can Contribute to Layer5\nMy experience clearly shows that you don’t necessarily need to know anything about coding or cloud native technologies to contribute to Layer5 projects. Are you a designer, technical writer, community manager, or digital marketer? There are several ways to contribute. You can\n- Work on improving the [documentation](https://docs.layer5.io),\n- Design new website pages or improve the UX of existing ones,\n- Warmly welcome newcomers to the community and offer support,\n- Give constructive feedback during the weekly meetings,\n- Talk about Layer5 and invite your friends to use and [star Meshery](https://github.com/meshery),\n- Write articles for our blog.\n\nThe list is endless. My advice is that you do not box yourself. Don’t feel that because you’re a designer, your contributions will be strictly design-related. If you want to make impactful contributions, pay attention to the needs of the community/project and help where you can.\n\nFor more guidance on contributing to Layer5, check out our [newcomer’s guide](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers).\n\n\n\\-- <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/victoria-nduka\">Victoria Nduka</Link>\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Contributing to Layer5: A Designer’s Journey","date":"Jan 7th, 2024","author":"Victoria Nduka","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/header-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAACgAAQUxQSBYAAAABF3D//4iIgkAQwsk8s9qBiP5nDsUAVlA4IHoAAADwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFWo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdAB0/ee7rnQZi638AAMstRxrtKSi7+7S8JymTGvCtcLKNLKKdplSAdauCkhgY2PJvuIh+bfYNM4XGU5sRiiIgEvM/Bf+BElPT/5qN9OgU8CEbdEgkn6py6rYfVa4AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/a66aa/header-image.webp 750w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/65dd5/header-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5632}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/header-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrYAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAACgAAQUxQSBYAAAABF3D//4iIgkAQwsk8s9qBiP5nDsUAVlA4IHoAAADwAwCdASoUAAsAPtFWo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdAB0/ee7rnQZi638AAMstRxrtKSi7+7S8JymTGvCtcLKNLKKdplSAdauCkhgY2PJvuIh+bfYNM4XGU5sRiiIgEvM/Bf+BElPT/5qN9OgU8CEbdEgkn6py6rYfVa4AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/a66aa/header-image.webp 750w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/65dd5/header-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/2148c3bf69bad32eb40e7aec06c3a9c2/76b72/header-image.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5632}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/contributing-to-layer5-a-designers-journey"}},{"id":"adc38a61-abc3-5bb4-8fae-413de18161ac","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nAs the final Kubernetes release of 2023, Kubernetes 1.29 is a <a href=\"https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/\">new release</a> of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release.\n<div className=\"intro\">\n      As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Cloud Native Performance</Link>. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kubernetes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you.\n</div>\n\nWhile there are a number of enhancements tracked in this release (72), you need to be aware that a number of these are code freezes or deprecations in 1.29. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, and important deprecations, so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. \n\nLet's breakdown new K8s features between networking and security categories.\n\n## Networking in Kubernetes 1.29\n\n### [Gateway API reaches 1.0](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io) [Stable] \n\nThe Gateway API has reached v1.0 in between Kubernetes 1.28 and 1.29. The Gateway API is the eventual successor to the Ingress API and significantly augments the Service API. The Kubernetes Service API is one of the oldest and most used APIs in Kubernetes. The Service API, in fact, was present in the very first public commit of Kubernetes in 2014, and almost everyone who deploys workloads in Kubernetes ends up using Services. Nearly ten years later in 2024, While Service API offers a kitchen sink full of functionality, it’s nearly ten year old design is limiting what can be done in Kubernetes networking.\n\nThe Gateway API takes a fresh approach in offering expressive, extensible, and role-oriented interfaces. Gateway API is expressive and extensible in that it offers core support for advanced traffic management (like traffic weighting, header-based matching) that is only possible through customizations in Ingress API. Gateway API is role-oriented in that it defines three main roles: infrastructure provider, cluster operator, and application developer, who need to work together to use and configure Kubernetes service networking. \n\n\n### [Sidecar Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753) [Beta]\n\nThe new sidecar feature enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support. The lack of native support has caused some usage friction, which this enhancement aims to resolve.\n\nThe new feature adds a new restartPolicy field to init containers that is available when the SidecarContainers feature gate is enabled. The field is optional and, if set, the only valid value is Always. Setting this field changes the behavior of init containers as follows: The container restarts if it exits. Any subsequent init container starts immediately after the startupProbe has successfully completed instead of waiting for the restartable init container to exit. The resource usage calculation changes for the pod as restartable init container resources are now added to the sum of the resource requests by the main containers. Pod termination continues to only depend on the main containers. An init container with a restartPolicy of Always (named a sidecar) won’t prevent the pod from terminating after the main containers exit.\n\nBeginning in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers (init containers with an Always restart policy), the kubelet will delay sending the TERM signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated. The sidecar containers will be terminated in the reverse order they are defined in the Pod spec. This ensures that sidecar containers continue serving the other containers in the Pod until they are no longer needed.\n\nThe behavior of this beta capability in 1.29 is that sidecar containers that have a `PreStop` hook will be notified when the Pod has begun terminating by executing the `PreStop` hook. Once the last primary container terminates, the last started sidecar container is notified by sending a `SIGTERM` signal. The next sidecar (in reverse order) is notified by sending a `SIGTERM` signal after the previous sidecar container terminates. This continues until all sidecar containers have terminated, or the Pod’s termination grace period expires. In the latter case, all remaining containers are notified by a `SIGTERM`, followed by a fixed grace period of 2 seconds and finally terminated. The Pod will be terminated after that.\n\nNote that slow termination of a main container will also delay the termination of the sidecar containers. If the grace period expires before the termination process is complete, the Pod may enter emergency termination. In this case, all remaining containers in the Pod will be terminated simultaneously with a short grace period.\n\nSimilarly, if the Pod has a `preStop` hook that exceeds the termination grace period, emergency termination may occur. In general, if you have used `preStop` hooks to control the termination order without sidecar containers, you can now remove them and allow the kubelet to manage sidecar termination automatically.\n\n### [Transition SPDY to WebSockets](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4006-transition-spdy-to-websockets) [Alpha]\n\nThis change aims to deprecate SPDY in favor of WebSockets for Kubernetes API server communications. WebSockets provide a more modern and scalable protocol that can improve the overall reliability and maintainability of Kubernetes communications. This can enhance security by making sure that the communication protocols used by Kubernetes are robust and well-supported.\n\nThese general enhancements contribute to a more secure and efficient Kubernetes environment. By improving Kubernetes’ underlying reliability, performance, and operational control, the above features lay the groundwork for a more secure infrastructure platform capable of hosting sensitive and critical workloads.\n\n## Security in Kubernetes 1.29\n\n### [Ensure Secret Pulled Images](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2535-ensure-secret-pulled-images) [Alpha]\n\nContainer images often contain sensitive components, making the security of image pull operations critical. The new alpha feature makes sure that images are always pulled using Kubernetes secrets of the Pod using them. This is important when Kubelet pulls an image for one Pod and another Pod is pointing to the same image. Up until now, the second Pod’s image request did not need authentication since it still used the first one’s credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access. By securing the image pull process, this enhancement prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with container images, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of workloads.\n\n### [SignedSigning Release Artifacts](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031) [Beta]\n\nEvery Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n### [Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799) [Beta]\n\n`BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.\n\n### [Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2799-reduction-of-secret-based-service-account-token) [Beta]\n\nIn addition to “Bound Service Account Token Improvements” enhancement and narrowing the scope of service account tokens, this improvement seeks to reduce the reliance on long-lived secret-based service account tokens. By limiting the use of these tokens, the potential attack surface is significantly diminished. \n\nThis move aligns with the broader industry trend of short-lived, just-in-time credentials that minimize the chances of token leakage leading to unauthorized access.\n\n### [Structured Authentication Configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3221-structured-authorization-configuration) [Alpha]\n\nSimilar to the authorization counterpart, Kubernetes 1.29 provides another alpha feature for structured configuration for authentication mechanisms. This enhancement offers users a more maintainable and secure approach to managing authentication, allowing administrators to implement complex authentication schemes more efficiently and with less room for error.\n\nWith the new enhancement, it is now possible to configure multiple OIDC providers, clients, and validation rules:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1alpha1\nkind: AuthenticationConfiguration\njwt:\n- issuer:\n  claimValidationRules:\n  ...\n  - expression: 'claims.exp - claims.nbf <= 86400'\n    message: total token lifetime must not exceed 24 hours\n  claimMappings:\n    username:\n      expression: 'claims.username + \":external-user\"'\n    groups:\n      expression: 'claims.roles.split(\",\")'\n       …\n  userValidationRules:\n  - expression: \"!user.username.startsWith('system:')\"\n    message: username cannot used reserved system: prefix\n  - expression: \"user.groups.all(group, !group.startsWith('system:'))\"\n    message: groups cannot used reserved system: prefix\n```\n\n## Last Kubernetes release of 2023\n\nKubernetes is an ever-evolving platform. For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endeavour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal. Dign into more details about deprecation, removals, and the latest changes in the 1.29 [release notes](https://relnotes.k8s.io/).\n\nOn behalf of the Layer5 community and all of the CNCF projects that its contributors steward, thank you to everyone who participated in this Kubernetes release, and congratulations! \n\nAs an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. \n\n## What's ahead for Kubernetes in 2024?\n\n### AI/MLOps\n\nGenerative AI came into the world with a big splash this year and helmsman, Kubernetes, is here helping navigate the AI waters. While some people suggest that the CNCF and Kubernetes ecosystem is in catch up mode in context of GenAI, they perhaps, forget that OpenAI is running a 7,500 node Kubernetes cluster in the development and hosting of GPT-3, CLIP, DALL·E, and research on other models. Where I think that Kubernetes and the CNCF can improve is in embracing and enabling AI/ML as a forerunner of our workload use cases. The CNCF has a massive developer ecosystem that will that can be enabled with MLOps and new model training projects like Kubeflow with its Kartib and KFServing sub-projects.\n\n### Looking past YAML\n\nDZone’s annual trend report on Kubernetes in the Enterprise has 55% of respondents identifying \"Maintaining YAML files” as one of the more significant, ongoing pain-points in their experience with Kubernetes. In 2024, I’m looking forward to CNCF projects like Meshery addressing this pain-point with [a visual designer for Kubernetes](/cloud-native-management/meshmap) resource and workflow configuration. The inability for some developers to either be capable of or have time to comprehend the intricacies of their virtualized applications by staring at endless lines of YAML is poised to significantly improve in 2024. \n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kubernetes 1.29 Highlights, Features, and Deprecations","date":"Dec 13th, 2023","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/kubernetes-new.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRowBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADwAAQUxQSIUAAAABgJpt27Lsxrov4NolEqE538EGZF3Bq9sEPoA1GjR2sOby/59/zwoRMQGQDM7uIw8UqyIblmXZv3lITpM9sPLbqFSZVZ6SWBH6It2NcBQFWOK/BUCewsYAzEhNACfSDsCeNDH6ndYz5cuyZ4Q/BJZlK0COdNUDaFHyAKBbfiU/Y4ZhmLgOAFZQOCDgAAAAcAUAnQEqFAAQAD7RVKNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCWwAsRtd6q4sAI8D2bIvNVvcVSZVMe7y5rvUAAD+1O1N+i568I+jjvex6S/RDVp+numDA7ovdqcUfNb8t7kk4/V5tU25zIiKFORSqU70tZLf9xmyH3hJh4vgFKeKrquj0fsFOsVq5Hn3kNDALJfeXRpHRD5t76jpyAaXHjulVIwln2v5wKtC0x5+0pzU2nQ6fo/vWo1BjacDMf7RxLgdF40ulzIG4zldtqdxhJrTZG+Q8ihOJoH+dP+Tv9snTP/8Fhff7nJk+AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/7826a/kubernetes-new.webp","srcSet":"/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/d331c/kubernetes-new.webp 750w,\n/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/8b4a5/kubernetes-new.webp 1080w,\n/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/7826a/kubernetes-new.webp 1334w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.8193403298350824}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/kubernetes-new-dark.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/7826a/kubernetes-new-dark.webp","srcSet":"/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/d331c/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 750w,\n/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/8b4a5/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 1080w,\n/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/7826a/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 1334w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.8193403298350824}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations"}},{"id":"bacbe561-602a-576b-a9ad-3e6a82e85954","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport mesheryLogo from \"../../../../assets/images/meshery/icon-only/meshery-logo-light.svg\";\nimport hacktoberfestEvent from \"./layer5-event-hacktoberfest2023.png\";\nimport cloudNativeHacktoberfest from \"./hacktoberfest-2023-with-layer5.png\";\nimport hacktoberfestBadge from \"./hacktoberfest-contributor.png\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nAs the leaves begin to turn and the air grows crisp, it can only mean one thing: [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) is here! This annual celebration of open source, hosted by DigitalOcean, invites contributors from all over the world to participate in a month-long extravaganza of code contributions.\n\nWhile the allure of limited-edition swag may be enticing, it's essential to approach Hacktoberfest with a mindset focused on quality, respect for maintainers, and a commitment to long-term community engagement.\n\nLayer5 has a long history of participating in Hacktoberfest. 2023 is no different. Our annual [Hacktoberfest kickoff and prep event](/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects) (be sure to join) is tomorrow.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Purposeful Participation: Beyond Swag Chasing and Profile Building\n\nBefore you embark on your Hacktoberfest journey, take a moment to reflect on your motivation. Are you here solely for the swag, just for the green boxes in your GitHub profile, or do you genuinely want to make a meaningful contribution to a project, learn, grow, and make new friends in the process?\n\nEmbrace the opportunity to forge lasting connections and dive deeper into topics that resonate with you.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Quality Over Quantity: Making a Lasting Impact\n\nWhile a flurry of pull requests may be impressive, maintainers value contributions that add genuine value.\n\nThink beyond code and consider how your unique skills—whether in design, organization, or other areas—can enrich the project. Open source thrives on meaningful contributions, so aim to make a tangible difference rather than settling for mediocrity.\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  quote=\"When you are clear about what motivates you, each contribution you make will help you achieve your goals, because you will be working on projects that are aligned with your values.\"\n  person=\"Lee Calcote\"\n/>\n\n---\n\n### 3. Guidelines Aren't Optional: Respecting the Playbook\n\nThat CONTRIBUTING.md file? It's not there for decoration. Treat it as your playbook, providing guidance for equitable collaboration.\n\nIgnoring these guidelines is akin to rearranging someone's furniture without permission. Established protocols are crucial, especially in projects with numerous contributors.\n\nAs an example, there is a full set of contributing docs written for Meshery — one for each component:\n\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-gitflow\">Contributing to Meshery using Git</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/meshery-windows\">Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release\">Contributing to Meshery Build and Release (CI)</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cypress\">End-to-End Tests using Cypress</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-adapters\">Meshery Adapters</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docker-extension\">Docker Extension</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-server\">Meshery Server</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-models\">Meshery Models</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-error\">MeshKit Compatible Errors</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui\">Meshery UI</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docs\">Docs</a>\n- <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli\">CLI</a>\n\n---\n\n### 4. Upholding a Safe Environment: The Code of Conduct\n\nRespect, collaboration, and kindness are the bedrock of open source. The Code of Conduct is non-negotiable, ensuring a secure and inclusive space for all contributors.\n\nThe [Layer5 Community Handbook](/community/handbook) offers an excellent reference for community norms and practices.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Engaging Beyond Code: Fostering Holistic Development\n\nDon’t confine yourself to a GitHub profile. Engage in meaningful discussions, participate in webinars, and [open discussions](https://discuss.layer5.io).\n\nOpen source offers a wealth of opportunities for comprehensive growth.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Compassion Over Code: Recognizing Maintainer Burnout\n\n<Link to=\"/community/handbook/repository-overview\">Maintainers</Link> are the unsung heroes of the open-source world, often overwhelmed by the Hacktoberfest influx.\n\nStart with issues tagged **good first issue** or **help wanted**.\n\n---\n\n### 7. The Virtue of Patience: Embracing the Long Game\n\nOpen source is a marathon, not a sprint. Feedback may take time. Patience is essential.\n\n---\n\n### 8. Humility and Gratitude: The Essence of Meaningful Contributions\n\nRemember, a meaningful contribution is its own reward. Swag and profile boosts are bonuses — not the goal.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Earn a Badge\n\nEarn a Hacktoberfest Contributor badge by contributing to Layer5 projects.\n\n<img src={hacktoberfestBadge} style={{ width: \"250px\" }} alt=\"Hacktoberfest badge\" />\n\n---\n\n# Join Layer5's Hacktoberfest Event\n\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\" style={{ width: \"80%\" }}>\n  <img src={cloudNativeHacktoberfest} alt=\"Hacktoberfest event\" />\n  <figcaption style={{ display: \"flex\", gap: \"2rem\" }}>\n    <div>\n      <strong>\n        <a href=\"/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects\">\n          Hacktoberfest Prep 2023\n        </a>\n      </strong>\n      <ul>\n        <li>DATE: September 29, 2023</li>\n        <li>TIME: 3PM UTC | 10AM Central | 8:30PM IST</li>\n        <li>EVENT: <a href=\"https://meet.layer5.io/community\">Zoom</a></li>\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nHacktoberfest is an opportunity for transformation.

Maybe someone has even asked you to star their repository. If you've ever wondered how much of an impact your star could make on their project, you're in the right place. Let's explore what GitHub Stars are and explore the significant role they play in boosting a project.\n\n### What are GitHub Stars?\n\nGitHub stars are like virtual thumbs-up or bookmarks that you can give to projects you like on the GitHub platform. They're a way to show that you find a project interesting, useful, or valuable. When you star a project, when you star a project, it's represented at the [stargazers](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/stargazers) section of the repository.\n\nStars are one of the key metrics that GitHub uses to track and identify trending projects on its platform. When a repository gains a significant number of stars within a relatively short period, it can be an indicator that the project is gaining popularity, and consequently, qualifies as a \"trending project\". \n\nHere's how GitHub uses stars to track trending projects:\n\n1. **Star Activity** -\nGitHub monitors the rate at which repositories are being starred. Projects that receive a sudden surge of stars are likely to catch the attention of GitHub's algorithms.\n1. **Time Interval** -\nGitHub takes into account the time frame within which stars are accumulated. Projects that gain stars rapidly in a short span of time are considered for trending status.\n1. **Relative Comparison** -\nTrending repositories are often determined based on a comparison with their usual star activity. If a repository's star activity significantly exceeds its typical rate, it might be flagged as trending.\n1. **Consistency** -\nWhile rapid stars are important, consistent activity also matters. Projects that sustain their increased star activity over time are more likely to be recognized as trending.\n\nOnce a repository meets these criteria, it might be highlighted on GitHub's Trending page or other curated sections of the platform. This visibility can attract even more attention and stars, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the project's popularity.\n\n### Effect of Stars on a Project\nStarring a project on GitHub does not directly impact the project’s functionality, but it can have several positive effects which include:\n\n- **Visibility** -\nStarring a project increases its visibility. Projects with more stars tend to appear higher in search results, making it easier for others to discover and contribute to the project\n- **Community Engagement** -\nA higher number of stars can attract more contributors, users, and potential collaborators. It indicates that the project has generated interest and resonates with others.\n- **Motivation** - \nFor project maintainers and contributors, seeing their project receive stars can be motivating. It shows that their work is appreciated and valued by the community.\n- **Recognition** - Starring a project is a way for users to acknowledge and recognize the effort put into it. It’s a form of social validation.\n- **Contributor Potential** - Potential contributors might use the number of stars a project has as a signal of the project’s importance and popularity. A well-started project might attract developers looking for projects to contribute to.\n- **Feedback and Support** - Starring can also serve as a lightweight way for users to express their support for the project or to keep track of projects they find interesting even if they don’t actively contribute.\n\nOverall, starring a project helps create a positive cycle where visibility leads to engagement, engagement leads to contributions, and contributions lead to a stronger project.\n\n### How to Star a Repository\nStarring a repository is a simple two-step process.\n- **Step 1:** On [GitHub](https://github.com/meshery/meshery), navigate to the main page of the repository.\n- **Step 2:** At the top-right corner of the page, click Star.\n\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n    <img src={Before}/>\n    <figcaption>\n    Before adding a star\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n <br/>\n<p style={{ display: \"flex\", justifyContent: \"center\" }}> This is what a project will look like after you have starred it:</p>\n<figure className=\"imgWithCaption\">\n    <img src={After}/>\n    <figcaption>\n    After adding a star\n    </figcaption>\n </figure>\n\n<br/>\n\n## Five Needs Your Stars\n\nNow that you understand how much impact stars can make, take a moment to help [Five on his Cloud Native journey](https://layer5.io/five/vol1/mascot-five-adventure-github-stars.pdf). Five is our intergalactic Cloud Native Hero on a journey to the Meshery planet. Five’s rocketship runs on stars and he needs all the stars he can get.

{ BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nKubernetes provides robust RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) capabilities to manage access and authorization within a cluster. This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2> \n\nBefore we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:\n<ol>\n  <li>Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.</li> \n  <li><code>kubectl</code>, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.</li>\n  <li>Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">set up</a> on your local machine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:</h2>\n\nTo bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:\n<strong>Step 1: Create a Service Account</strong>\nFirst, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named <code>my-service-account</code>:\n<pre><code>sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<strong>Step 2: Create a ClusterRole</strong>\nNext, let's create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named <code>my-cluster-role</code> that has read-only access to Pods and Services:\n```yaml\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\", \"services\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n```\n<br />\nSave the above YAML definition to a file named <code>clusterrole.yaml</code>, and create the ClusterRole using the following command:\n<pre><code>bash kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml</code></pre>\n<br />\n<strong>Step 3: Bind the Service Account with ClusterRole</strong>\nFinally, we need to bind the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:\n<pre><code>bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\nThe above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named <code>my-cluster-role-binding</code> that associates the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>.\n<strong>Verification:</strong>\nTo verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:\n<pre><code>bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding</code></pre>\n<br />\nYou should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the <code>Subjects</code> and <code>RoleRef</code> sections, respectively.\n<h2>Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:</h2>\nMeshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including <a href=\"https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kubernetes clusters</a>. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.\nTo utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:\n<strong>Step 1: Install Meshery</strong>\nRefer to the official Meshery <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.\n<strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster</strong>\nOnce Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.\n<strong>Step 3: Access MeshMap</strong>\nAfter successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the <a href = \"https://playground.meshery.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshery</a> user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.\n<strong>Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap</strong>\nOnce you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:\n<ol>\n  <li>From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.</li>\n  <li>Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.</li>\n  <li>Click on the \"Generate Map\" button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.</li>\n  <li>Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster's architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nIn this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster.

To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.\n  Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each\n  merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n<h2> How release channels offer subscription </h2>\n  Release Channels offers a subscription where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery.\n  However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.\n\nTherefore, it's important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It's recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.\nTo subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use \n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set [stable|stable-version|edge|edge-version] </code></pre>\nThis command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable</code> or <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56</code>\n<h2> Switching between Release Channels</h2>\nThere are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we'll cover both methods.\n<h3>What is Meshconfig?</h3>\n  Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the <code>~/.meshery/config.yaml</code> directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. \n  Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery\n<ol>\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.</h3>\nOpen your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  <code>mesheryctl version</code>. If you don't have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl\">Meshery documentation</a>.\n<li>Create new Meshery config.yaml file <pre><code className=\"language=bash\">mesheryctl system context create [context-name]</code></pre></li>\nExample: <br/> <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes </code>\n<li> To view the newly created meshery context use <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view [context-name]</code></pre></li>\n<li>After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context switch</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.</h3>\nmesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here's how:\n<ul>\n  <li>Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery: <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view</code></pre><img src={MesheryVersion} className=\"image-center\" style={{ width: \"50%\" }} />This will show you the current release channel (<b>stable</b> or <b>edge</b>), along with the version number and other information.</li>\n  <li>Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel switch</code></pre>This command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus. To switch the channel to a specific version, replace <b>Version</b> with the desired version number.</li>\n  <li>To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again: <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel view</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion </h2>\n\n  Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward process. You can do it using mesheryctl or by switching between your meshconfig file. Whether you want stable updates or bleeding-edge features, Meshery has a release channel that suits your needs. Just remember to carefully consider your use case and needs before making any changes to ensure that you have the best Meshery experience.\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Changing Meshery Release Channels","date":"Jun 16th, 2023","author":"Karan Thakur","thumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/change-meshery-release-channels.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/afa5c/change-meshery-release-channels.png","srcSet":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/0dee1/change-meshery-release-channels.png 750w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/8beaa/change-meshery-release-channels.png 1080w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/d079a/change-meshery-release-channels.png 1366w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/afa5c/change-meshery-release-channels.png 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/a66aa/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 750w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/65dd5/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 1080w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/4fad6/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 1366w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/c512e/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/change-meshery-release-channels.png","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/afa5c/change-meshery-release-channels.png","srcSet":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/0dee1/change-meshery-release-channels.png 750w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/8beaa/change-meshery-release-channels.png 1080w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/d079a/change-meshery-release-channels.png 1366w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/afa5c/change-meshery-release-channels.png 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/a66aa/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 750w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/65dd5/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 1080w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/4fad6/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 1366w,\n/static/60fe9ee92d711b8b6d591e00535d18ef/c512e/change-meshery-release-channels.webp 1920w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/changing-meshery-release-channels"}},{"id":"95eff442-aa1d-53ff-b85f-e67348ec1495","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nHello👋, I'm Sudhanshu Dasgupta, a driven individual from the quaint city of Katni in Madhya Pradesh, India. \nI have an unwavering passion for learning and exploring new horizons in the world of technology and very passionate for open-source.

By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share tips on how to have the best community experience possible.</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Yash, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Yash is and how you arrived at your MeshMate role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Hey Vivek, thanks for having me! One day, I was scrolling through Twitter and saw someone praising the Layer5 community. I was curious, so I checked it out and joined their Slack channel. As a newbie to open-source, I was unsure about many things, but Shivam ( an amazing contributor ), welcomed me and suggested I should attend the Meshery Dev meet to learn more.\"\n      \"I picked up some issues and started working on them but soon hit a wall. Then one day, Lee Calcote messaged me and said he had me on his intern's list, but noticed I wasn't around the community much. So I reached out to Abhishek and Gaurav for help on how to get more involved. They showed me how to contribute and help others, and then I started attending dev calls, helping others, and making new friends.\"\n”After a while, I received a message from Lee and Gaurav saying that I would look good in the MeshMate logo I was surprised. It was one of the best things to happen to me, but also came with a responsibility to help others in the community and guide them on their journey.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      You’re a MeshMate and have been for some long time now. What does being a MeshMate mean to you? What does it take to be a successful MeshMate?\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Being a MeshMate is not just an honor, it is also a responsibility towards the community. MeshMates are individuals who are committed to help other members of the community. This includes ensuring that community members have access to resources, are introduced to other members, and understand the vision and goals of the projects.”\n      \"I have always loved learning in a community because with a community, we can grow together. Similarly, MeshMates always make sure that their mentees are successful along with the project. It's a great feeling to be a part of a community where everyone is working towards the same goal and supporting each other along the way.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n      What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"I remember introducing Meshery and MeshMap in my college event. It was an incredibly successful event, and I take great pride in being a part of a community that supports such innovative projects. The response from the attendees was overwhelming, and I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the contributors who played a pivotal role in making this project a resounding success. Their collective efforts truly deserve admiration and appreciation.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      What is your favorite part of the Layer5 Community? Of being a MeshMate?\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"When I joined Layer5 community I got a welcome message with helping instructions so that I can contribute smoothly and I think this shows how much this community cares about their contributors which I like most about Layer5, everyone here is so welcoming and helping.\"\n      \"Being a MeshMate you get exposure in community which is really good for your growth but this is not best part of being a MeshMate, the best part is the feeling you get after helping someone and being little part of their success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      With the number of people  that join the Layer5 community everyday, how do you deal with the continued influx of newcomers?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Layer5 is big community over 4000+ members on slack and everyday so many people join Layer5 community and connecting with newcomers everyday is really not easy it takes time and your little strength too but as I said earliar, being a MeshMate also comes with responsibility which I enjoy most 😎.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Impressively, you’re also a software engineering intern at Layer5. How did this come to be? What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery and the Layer5 community?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Truelly I never joined Layer5 with mindset of internship after I joined Layer5 I saw here people learning new things as they are working on projects, making growth in their personality and improving engineering skills which is what I actually want. Layer5 offers internships all the time and these internships are offered to those who make impact in community and contribute consistently. After 2 months of making impact and contributing consistently I got mail with offer of internship.\"\n      \"Layer5 is growing everyday and many people started using Meshery, MeshMap and other projects for their businesses with this growth my personal goal is to work start helping projects in field of Devops and backend and also I like learning and sharing in public so I’ll also try to spread word of what we do here to appreciate everyone's effort.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\nNow, I’ve heard of Community Badges, but what are these? How many are there? More importantly, how do I collect the whole set?! 🙂\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Haha the way you are making impact in community soon you’ll get all Vivek, Badges are signs of contributors' efforts in their respective fields given by community. There are different badges for different efforts and I have this which represents MeshMate. I would really like to see you getting so many badges Vivek 😉.\"\n      \"Badges are not also easy to take, this requires your efforts and time towards community and its projects. As I said Layer5 community always wants its contributors' success because with their success it’s layer5's success and badges are one of the ways of recognising contributors' efforts.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n      Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re particularly proud of?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"😂 some of my favourite questions, I really like using this 🚀 emoji which represents the feeling of keep doing and keep pushing until it's done. I am mostly a night person, as I feel most productive during that time, although I don't recommend it.\"\n      \"I worked on different projects of Layer5 and I am proud for all of them though my favorite part is getting Meshery and MeshMap support default dark mode so that user will get smooth experience of using Meshery or MeshMap \"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Yes Cloud native ecosystem is so vast and constantly evolving. I think being part of cloud native community helps me stay up-to-date with its fast moving ecosystem and I’ll also suggest everyone to join community from any platform you like Slack, Twitter or your favorite platform \"\n      \"As I said Cloud native is so vast so as it’s community too there are so many updated resources available out their on internet by community, which helps me to keep update with Cloud native ecosystem\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n<span>Vivek:</span> What  advice do you have for individuals who are hopeful to become Layer5 contributors, interns, or potentially MeshMates?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n<span>Yash:</span>\n      \"Try to come out of your comfort zone. If you are reading this conversation, you are already out of your comfort zone, which is a really good step. Who I am today is because I came out of my comfort zone, which I would also prefer. Lastly, be more helpful towards the community and, most importantly, be consistent. I wish you success.\"\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"note\"><img src={ForkLift} height=\"100px\"/>The open source community at Layer5 is an award winning program and continues to evolve as it grows in number daily.

{ BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nKubernetes provides a Service to offer a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. While it offers a VIP to the clients for access and Kubernetes ensures traffic balancing for the accessing back-end Pods, it has a limitation of routing traffic from outside the cluster. The Kubernetes Service setting of \"NodePort\" was created to overcome this issue. \n\nBy setting up a mapping to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, a NodePort Service redirects traffic from the outside to the inside of the cluster. When a NodePort Service is created, Kubernetes control plane allocates its corresponding ports in two ways. The first is dynamic, where Kubernetes control plane automatically assigns an unused port at the creation time. The second is static, which assigns a port within the nodeport port range configuration. It is crucial to assign a unique nodePort across the entire cluster while manually assigning nodePort, or it will result in an error if a service of type NodePort already uses that port. \n\nSometimes, there is a need to run a NodePort Service on well-known ports so that other components and users inside or outside the cluster can use them. In such cases, users need to reserve the required ports before using them. Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature gate \"ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange\" that allows users to use a different port allocation strategy for type NodePort Services. Enabling this feature gate will divide the port range for NodePort Services based on a formula that uses nodeport size and determines the size of the static port range.\n\nHere are a few examples of different port ranges and their band offset values:\n<div className=\"table-3\">\n\n| Range properties | Values |\n| --- | --- |\n| service-node-port-range | 30000-32767 |\n| Band Offset | 86 |\n| Static band start | 30000 |\n| Static band end | 30085 |\n| Dynamic band start | 30086 |\n| Dynamic band end | 32767 |\n\n</div>\n<br />\n<div className=\"table-3\">\n\n| Range properties | Values |\n| --- | --- |\n| service-node-port-range | 30000-30015 |\n| Band Offset | 16 |\n| Static band start | 30000 |\n| Static band end | 30015 |\n| Dynamic band start | N/A |\n| Dynamic band end | N/A |\n\n</div>\n\nNodePort Services can be useful in many scenarios. For example, consider a user that needs to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients running outside the Kubernetes cluster. The agreed port is 30009, and the user needs to create a Service as follows:\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: minio\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - name: api\n    nodePort: 30009\n    port: 9000\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: 9000\n  selector:\n    app: minio\n  type: NodePort\n```\nIf the port required for the Minio Service is not reserved and another NodePort (or possibly LoadBalancer) Service is created and dynamically allocated before or concurrently with the Minio Service, the TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that other Service. In this case, creation of the Minio Service will fail due to a node port collision. \n\nIn conclusion, using the NodePort Service will help Kubernetes users by allowing traffic to be routed from outside to inside the cluster, providing a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. By enabling the ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange feature gate, users can adopt a different port allocation strategy, reducing the risk of collisions while using a different range of ports.\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kubernetes NodePorts - Static and Dynamic Assignments","date":"May 12th, 2023","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFcpU6oJSMiKAqpABoJagCdAA7o/xI+daMhu4ZyKIc8AP5sMkrm/KSMElhNhyFx1gsn7iAKtDbnb2EOpN1Lu4ERxHR8dZzo2nLfaBjTkL7HUoWJ2ZeN3kbroyt5qSiHJrjn1s8R/0YvwxgPzzQOJ6Z6/jny3fK+Q/p/RG8WRYpz7F7kTd49j//OPWbkB/vQwHCyP2a8pf47eyzW5wuh8SG+Fee1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp","srcSet":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/4f03f/k8s-nodeports.webp 750w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFcpU6oJSMiKAqpABoJagCdAA7o/xI+daMhu4ZyKIc8AP5sMkrm/KSMElhNhyFx1gsn7iAKtDbnb2EOpN1Lu4ERxHR8dZzo2nLfaBjTkL7HUoWJ2ZeN3kbroyt5qSiHJrjn1s8R/0YvwxgPzzQOJ6Z6/jny3fK+Q/p/RG8WRYpz7F7kTd49j//OPWbkB/vQwHCyP2a8pf47eyzW5wuh8SG+Fee1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp","srcSet":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/4f03f/k8s-nodeports.webp 750w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments"}},{"id":"621f501d-ecf1-5552-aadb-9540d59d48f1","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\nimport mesheryMostPopular from \"./meshery-most-popular-lfx-internship.webp\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport powerOfMeshery from \"../../../..//assets/images/playground/gitops-explore-design.webp\";\nimport CTA_FullWidth from \"../../../../components/Call-To-Actions/CTA_FullWidth\";\nimport CTA_ImageOnly from \"../../../../components/Call-To-Actions/CTA_ImageOnly\";\nimport Playfield from \"./layer5-community-playfield.webp\";\nimport MesheryStats from \"./meshery-contrib-stats.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nThe Layer5 open source community has reached a milestone that deserves to be celebrated: we're now 4,000 members and growing.

As part of its functionality, Kubernetes offers a feature called \"Admission Controllers\" that allow administrators to enforce certain policies on resources being created in the cluster.\n\nIn this blog post, we will be discussing a new feature in Kubernetes called \"Validating Admission Policies\" which is currently in alpha stage. This feature allows administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster and enforce those rules using admission controllers.\n\n## What are Admission Controllers?\n\nAdmission controllers are pluggable components in the Kubernetes API server that intercept requests to create, update, or delete resources in the cluster. They allow administrators to enforce certain policies on these requests before they are persisted in the etcd database and acted upon by the Kubernetes control plane.\n\nThere are various types of admission controllers available in Kubernetes, such as:\n\n- **NamespaceLifecycle**: This admission controller enforces policies related to namespace creation and deletion.\n- **LimitRanger**: This admission controller enforces resource limits on pods, such as CPU and memory limits.\n- **PodSecurityPolicy**: This admission controller enforces security policies on pods, such as privileged mode, host networking, and volumes.\n\n## Validating Admission Policies\n\nValidating admission policies allow administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster. These rules can be defined using a custom resource definition (CRD) called \"ValidatingWebhookConfiguration\" and are enforced by the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller.\n\nFor example, an administrator may want to enforce a policy that requires all pods in the cluster to have a specific label. They can define this rule using a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration CRD and configure the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller to enforce it. Any request to create a pod that does not have the required label will be rejected by the admission controller.\n\nValidating admission policies also allow administrators to use external webhooks to perform the validation. This can be useful when the validation logic is complex or requires access to external resources.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nValidating admission policies is a new feature in Kubernetes that allows administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster. These rules can be enforced using the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller, and external webhooks can also be used for complex validation logic. This feature can be useful for enforcing policies and ensuring compliance in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"What are Kubernetes Validating Admission Controllers?","date":"Feb 3rd, 2023","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/kubernetes-new.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpwAAABXRUJQVlA4IJAAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFgqE+oJSOiKAgBABoJbADBzYrIcLaTwo9+PMnGQagAAP72Av+XnXpDovXZeeq4tTUzLytHh8EOuq1sofHN2IthfXcoC9jFvtZhVo+tDrkfaFYPTkFWBWNyondfXcOX/mOVgrxqRCV7kvjREw4wZJCrfL9qeXzh9e/A/AD1++Ek5WwAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/3987a/kubernetes-new.webp","srcSet":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/4f03f/kubernetes-new.webp 750w,\n/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/3987a/kubernetes-new.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/kubernetes-new-dark.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/3987a/kubernetes-new-dark.webp","srcSet":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/4f03f/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 750w,\n/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/3987a/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/what-are-kubernetes-validating-admission-controllers"}},{"id":"6a0f849a-8fcf-586a-9cf3-0beaac085455","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nAs the final Kubernetes release of 2022, Kubernetes 1.26 is an exciting new release of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release.\n<div className=\"intro\">\n      As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link>. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you.\n</div>\n\nWhile there are a number of enhancments tracked in this release (38), you need to be aware that there are also a number of features being deprecated (10) in 1.26. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, important deprecations, and removals so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. \n\nWe'll breakdown new K8s features by category, starting with networking.\n\n## Networking in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [Service Internal Traffic Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2086) [Stable]\n\nWhen requests are made to a Kubernetes service, they are randomly distributed to all available endpoints. The new enhancement enriches the API of a service to use node-local and topology-aware routing for internal traffic. The new internalTrafficPolicy field has two options: Cluster (default) and Local. The Cluster option works like before and tries distributing requests to all available endpoints. On the other hand, the Local option only sends requests to node-local endpoints and drops the request if there is no available instance on the same node. The Local option is useful for sending metrics or logs to an agent running as a DaemonSet. \n\n### [Reserve Service IP Ranges for Dynamic and Static IP Allocation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3070) [Stable]\n\nKubernetes services are assigned a virtual ClusterIP to be reachable inside the cluster. The ClusterIP is either assigned dynamically from a configured Service IP range, or statically set while creating the service resource. There was no possibility of knowing whether another service in the cluster had already used the static ClusterIP before this new stable enhancement. With this change, the IP range is divided into two; this prevents conflicts between services implementing dynamic IP allocation and static IP assignment. The flag --service-cluster-ip-range, with CIDR notation, is part of the Kubernetes API server configuration and is ready to use with the 1.26 release. \n\n### [Support of Mixed Protocols in Services with Type LoadBalancer](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1435) [Stable]\n\nKubernetes Services that use the LoadBalancer type have only supported a single Layer 4 protocol until now. With this enhancement going from graduating to stable in v1.26, it is possible to define a mix of protocols in the same service definition. In other words, this enhancement allows a LoadBalancer Service to serve different protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP) under the same port (e.g. 443). For example, serving both UDP and TCP requests for a DNS or SIP server on the same port. For instance, you can expose a DNS server with a single load balancer IP for both TCP and UDP requests, such as the following:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: multi-protocol-dns-server\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - name: dns-udp\n      port: 53\n      protocol: UDP\n    - name: dns-tcp\n      port: 53\n      protocol: TCP\n  selector:\n    app: dns-server\n```\n\n## Security in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [kubelet Credential Provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2133) [Stable]\n\nThe kubelet agent has a built-in credential provider mechanism to retrieve credentials for container image registries. It natively supports Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS container image registries for dynamically retrieving their credentials. The new stable enhancement in v1.26 offers a replacement for the in-tree implementations, and creates an API for extensible plugins in the future. \n\n### [SignedSigning Release Artifacts](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031) [Beta]\n\nEvery Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n### [Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799) [Beta]\n\n`BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.\n\n### [Windows Privileged Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1981) [Stable] and [Host Networking](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3503) [Alpha] \n\nPrivileged containers are the ones that have similar access and capabilities to the host processes running on the servers. In Linux environments, they are used heavily in Kubernetes for storage, networking, and management. In this release, support for privileged containers for the Windows environment graduates to stable. Management of processes is heavily different from the operating system standpoint in Linux and Windows. Therefore, privileged containers will also work differently in two environments, but they will ensure the same level of security and operational experience.\n\nIn addition, there is a new alpha-level enhancement in this release to support host networking for Windows pods. Currently, Windows has all the functionality to make containers use the networking namespace of the nodes. The new alpha enhancement enables this functionality from the Kubernetes side, increasing the parity between Linux and Windows containers.\n\n### [Self-User Attribute and Authentication API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/33250) [Alpha] \n\nKubernetes has no resources to identify and manage users as part of its API. Instead, it uses authenticators to get user attributes from tokens, certificates, OIDC providers, or webhooks. The new alpha feature adds a new API endpoint to see what attributes the current users have. The new API is under authentication.k8s.io with the name SelfSubjectReview, and there is a new corresponding command as well: kubectl auth who-am-i. The new feature will reduce the obscurity of complex authentication and help users debug the authentication stack. \n\n## Scheduling in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [Non-Graceful Node Shutdown for StatefulSet Pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2268) [Beta]\n\nAs a platform Kubernetes is hardened and has been deploy by thousands and thousands of users. Hardening of Kubernetes makes itself resistant to disasters. The kubelet agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster already uses graceful node shutdown to detect and offboard workloads to other nodes. However, when the shutdown is not detected by the kubelet, the pods of a `StatefulSet` are stuck as `Terminating` and not transferred to a healthy node. The kubelet on the downed node will not delete its pods from Kubernetes API, and the StatefulSet controller will not create new pods with the same name. This happens due to a conflict in the Kubernetes machinery. With this enhancement moving into beta, though, pods will be forcefully deleted along with their volume attachments and new pods will be migrated (created) on healthy nodes.\n\n### [Pod Scheduling Readiness](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3521) [Alpha]\n\nCurrently, pods are considered ready for scheduling as soon as they are created. However, not every pod requires a node, resource allocation, and the start of all its containers immediately after its creation. The new alpha enhancement adds an API to mark pods with their scheduling status: paused and ready. Pods with the .spec.schedulingGates field will be parked in the scheduler and only be assigned to nodes when they are ready to be scheduled.\n\n### [kubectl explain to use OpenAPI v3 for ](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3515) [Alpha]\n\nUse of OpenAPI v3 means supporting rich type information in `kubectl explan`. Kubernetes has supported OpenAPI v3 as a beta since version 1.24. This richer representation of the fields in the Kubernetes API, means that users can use the `kubectl explain` command to get information that is only detailed in  OpenAPI v3, and not the subset defined OpenAPI v2.\n\n## Deprecations and Removals\n\nConsistent to the Kubernetes API lifecycle is deprecations and removals of APIs in each release. It is strongly suggested to check whether you are using the following APIs and flags before there are breaking changes.\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Removal of the `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group for `FlowSchema` and `PriorityLevelConfiguration` requires a migration to the v1beta2 API version.\n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of the `autoscaling/v2beta2` API version for HorizontalPodAutoscaler requires a migration to the autoscaling/v2 API version. \n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of legacy and vendor-specific authentication client-go and kubectl for Azure and Google Cloud requires migration to vendor-neutral authentication plugin mechanisms.\n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of in-tree CSI integration for OpenStack—namely, the `cinder` volume type—requires a migration to use the CSI driver for OpenStack. \n</li>\n<li>\n  Some unused options and flags for the kubectl run command are marked as deprecated in the 1.26 release, such as `--grace-period`, `--timeout`, and `--wait`.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Last Kubernetes release of 2022\n\nKubernetes is an ever-evolving platform. For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endevour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal.

One of the key components of Kubernetes is its logging and instrumentation capabilities. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.26 release has a handful of noteworthy changes to its system component logger, <code>klog</code>.\n## Kubernetes System Log\n\nSystem component logs record events happening in K8s clusters. More than metrics or traces, logs are the telemetric signal often found to be most useful for debugging. You can configure K8s log verbosity to see more or less detail. Logs can be as coarse-grained as showing errors within a component, or as fine-grained as showing step-by-step traces of events (like HTTP access logs, pod state changes, controller actions, or scheduler decisions).\n\n## Klog\n\n[klog](https://github.com/kubernetes/klog) is a Kubernetes logging library that provides an API for developers and system administrators to instrument their applications for logging and tracing. klog generates log messages for the Kubernetes system components. It provides a comprehensive set of features, including log levels, structured logging and logging context.\n\nKubernetes 1.23 introduced structured logging (in beta) in `klog`. Structured logging is a uniform structure in log messages allowing for programmatic extraction of information. Structured logs can be stored and processed with less effort and cost. The code which generates a log message determines whether it uses the traditional unstructured `klog` output or structured logging.\n\nAs a dependency to structured logging (gated behind `StructuredLogging` feature gate), Kubernetes 1.24 introducted contextual logging (in alpha) in `klog`. Contextual logging builds on top of structured logging. It is primarily about how developers use logging calls: code based on that concept is more flexible and supports additional use cases which will be the topic of a future blog post. \n\n### Klog Deprecations in Kubernetes 1.26\n\nKubernetes has recently announced that it intends to deprecate certain flags related to Klog in its components. This means that Klog-specific flags, such as `--klog-verbosity`, `--klog-vmodule` and `--klog-stderrthreshold` will no longer be supported. This is due to the fact that Klog has been largely superseded by the more comprehensive OpenTelemetry project, which provides a more complete solution for logging and instrumentation.\n\nThe deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes as it moves to OpenTelemetry. This move will ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard logging and instrumentation solution. It will also provide developers and system administrators with a more comprehensive, reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.\nA goal of this deprecation is one of unblocking development of alternative logging formats. Why does Kubnernetes need another logging format? One reason is performance. Klog performance is much worse than alternatives, for example 7-8x than JSON format:\n\n|logger                 |time [ns/op]|bytes[B/op]|allocations[alloc/op]|\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n|Text Infof             |2252        |248        |3                    |\n|Text InfoS             |2455        |280        |3                    |\n|JSON Infof             |1406        |19         |1                    |\n|JSON InfoS             |319         |67         |1                    |\n\nProof of concept implementation of new logging formats were completed to assess the potentional gains of using an alternative format. Results measured on 30s benchmark for passing 2 arguments to format function.\n\n<div className=\"tip\">\n<h3>Tip: Logger Performance Comparison</h3>\n\nInterestingly, Klog isn't the fastest logger in the West, but Uber's open source project [zap ](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) appears to hold that title instead. The following performance test benchmark is an examle of one of a number of scenarios in which loggers can be performance analyzed.\n\n\nLog a message and 10 fields:\n| Package             |    Time     | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |\n| :------------------ | :---------: | :-----------: | :---------------: |\n| zap                 | 2900 ns/op  |      +0%      |    5 allocs/op    |\n| zap (sugared)       | 3475 ns/op  |     +20%      |   10 allocs/op    |\n| zerolog             | 10639 ns/op |     +267%     |   32 allocs/op    |\n| go-kit              | 14434 ns/op |     +398%     |   59 allocs/op    |\n| logrus              | 17104 ns/op |     +490%     |   81 allocs/op    |\n| apex/log            | 32424 ns/op |    +1018%     |   66 allocs/op    |\n| log15               | 33579 ns/op |    +1058%     |   76 allocs/op    |\n</div>\n\nOutput will always be written to stderr, regardless of the output format. Output redirection is expected to be handled by the component which invokes a Kubernetes component. This can be a POSIX shell or a tool like systemd.\n\nThe deprecation of Klog-specific flags is part of a larger effort to transition Kubernetes to a more modern and comprehensive logging and instrumentation solution. This will provide Kubernetes users with a more reliable, secure and consistent experience when instrumenting and monitoring their applications.\n\nKubernetes will continue to provide support for Klog-specific flags for the foreseeable future. However, it is recommended that developers and system administrators begin transitioning their applications to the OpenTelemetry framework. This will ensure that their applications are using the industry-standard solution for logging and instrumentation.\n\nOverall, the deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes. It will ensure that Kubernetes users have access to the most reliable and comprehensive solution for logging and instrumentation. It will also help ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard solution and will provide developers and system administrators with a more reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Structured logging in Kubernetes with Klog","date":"Dec 5th, 2022","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/kubernetes-logs.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRo4AAABXRUJQVlA4IIIAAAAQBACdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJbADE2A9oOHBqhtd/PoCpgAD+9hPef0TEKVio6tt3FOets66Z3rYkj6VKa9nnk5BswW619qW3HimtX50rDTgg73noredVBvmuHNfM92EZ3yl/IPFRzvtyYwEvFfOxgqRkERYrQM26gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/3987a/kubernetes-logs.webp","srcSet":"/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/4f03f/kubernetes-logs.webp 750w,\n/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/3987a/kubernetes-logs.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmwBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSLYAAAABgGNtm6rmnxncSt2Hyy7cNkClrbvuACqnooV4d0uquKfkUMYNnbknWUFETAD8a+TMU1M6mqgpleqTSb1Uqs7SJDlQXt/eXitBWGQyzyeTuZkHMiw4bmHgAST89BQmTMZCNlOoVguZhIihvDxdnhzNxr9LFQ2Vl51lu9UePvPgjo8PZqMvFnA0qWkpgziNdxKBmEGSg21y+fnu4iX8+Y0QmrhGMMZY/B0hQMeh8k4fAVaEdyL4S1ZQOCCQAAAA8AMAnQEqFAAUAD7RWqNNKCUjIigNUQAaCWwAvkgQ3sibXv8o78YB8AD+6/YtrSM9Rc5Lz22/yXt8aymW8E1+TIYMBxpYCXm0QnmjTq/+uaLWqy+vQVQ7N8FLsC99nCFhoHFMXPczNJAr19SR9ikZu45mfBuGjhMpGfqKbpZZoFUGz46t/rzj/oRetDiwAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/3987a/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp","srcSet":"/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/4f03f/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp 750w,\n/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/3987a/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/structured-logging-in-kubernetes-with-klog"}},{"id":"55c8888d-0fbc-5346-8e55-aa0103a25ad3","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n  Detroit welcomes the largest open-cloud and container-based developer events and workshops in the world.

In this post,\n    we'll take a look behind the scenes at how each component in Meshery's\n    architecture plays a role in the management of many Kubernetes clusters.\n\n</div>\n\n## Philosophy behind Meshery's multi-cluster management approach\n\nWhile designing Meshery for the world of many clouds, and many Kubernetes clusters, much care has been taken to ensure that Meshery is an <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extensible management platform</a>, ready for handling new types of infrastructure and new use cases rapidly through its plugin model. Under the hood, <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\">Meshery Server</a> acts as a delegator of operations by figuring out which Meshery Adapter registered its capability against the given operation. The operation is then sent to that given component (like one of Meshery’s adapters,e.g. Istio adapter) via a gRPC call. <img src={CoreArch} alt=\"deploy modal\"  className=\"image-right\"/> When the operation involves a Kubernetes cluster(s), the kubeconfig(s) is sent as a parameter to the RPCs. It is then the job of the handling adapter to respect that and perform the operation across the passed clusters from kubeconfigs as needed. The operations not requiring a kubeconfig are managed through the same RPC, with the only difference being that the handling component would ignore the `kubeconfigs` field altogether making the system work not just for Kubernetes, but for other cloud native use cases. This approach of reusing the same RPC for different types of requests is pretty common and sometimes debatable with the other approach of being strict with the RPCs. This is what makes Meshery completely pluggable and extensible.\n\n## Using multi cluster with Meshery\n\nFrom a client's perspective, there are two uses of the multi context feature in general. While deploying a <Link to=\"/kanvas\">Kanvas</Link> design or performing any other operation on their cluster(s), selecting any number of Kubernetes contexts will allow them to uniformly and parallely perform the operation across the clusters. And while visualizing the state of their cluster(s), the same context switcher will allow them to filter across the clusters whose view they want to see.\n\nAll cluster specific operations are now applied over a number of clusters uniformly. So if you have 10 clusters to manage and 8 of those start with the exact same set of pods, deployments, services, etc then <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> can help you to apply these operations quickly and easily.\n\nIt is as simple as selecting the specific cluster(s) from the Kubernetes context switcher in the navbar, and then applying whatever operation you wanted to, whether that be deploying a sample app, a Prometheus daemonset, or a <Link to=\"/kanvas\">Kanvas</Link> design.\n\n\nJust before applying the operation, you will be prompted with a confirmation modal which will provide the information about which cluster(s) that operation will be performed against. As the User interface improves, this same modal will also convey more useful information about the operation they are going to perform.\n\n\n<br />\n\n### Using Kanvas Operator Mode\n\nYou can switch between views of your cluster in visualizer mode while using <a href=\"https://kanvas.new\">Kanvas</a>.\n\n\n\n### Managing Meshery on multiple clusters\n\nUsers can perform cluster related operations from the settings page like adding more clusters, removing data from existing clusters and removing existing clusters.\n\n<img src={Settings} alt=\"Settings page\" className=\"slides-right\"/>\n\nMeshery also deploys Meshery operator across the cluster it’s about to manage. This operator manages the lifecycle of a Meshery broker and MeshSync. MeshSync pumps the blood into Meshery’s core, in other words, it is responsible for watching all different types of resources by establishing a watch stream over each of them. MeshSync then pumps that data into the NATS server, of which Meshery server itself is a client. From there, Meshery server gets all the relevant data related to activities in the cluster.\n\nBy default, <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> wants to be as much aware about your infrastructure as possible to provide value so it deploys its operator across each detected cluster. But you can fine tune this configuration by going over each one of them from the table as shown.\n\n<img\n  src={Cluster}\n  alt=\"Kubernetes multi-cluster management with Meshery\"\n  className=\"image-center-shadow\"/>\n\nIf you disconnect your cluster and do not want to persist the data from that cluster then you can perform a fine-grained deletion by deleting all MeshSync data (which are the Kubernetes objects) for that specific cluster.\n\n<img src={Flush} alt=\"flushing MeshSync data\" className=\"image-center-shadow\"/>\n## Future of multi-cluster\n\nMeshery as an extension point to your infrastructure provides out-of-the-box value by adding components which can be Kubernetes specific, service mesh specific or custom components to add new functionality. We can now add multi-cluster specific components to provide more abstraction. This model can be used along with Meshery’s multi-mesh capabilities to give an overall multi-mesh multi-cluster experience to the user. For instance, your Istio service mesh spanning across multiple clusters can be abstracted and managed by Meshery using custom components such as VirtualGateway and VirtualDestinationRules. In this case, Meshery’s Istio adapter will handle the logic of converting a VirtualGateway into gateways across the clusters. This abstraction provides high value by powering the service mesh to span across the clusters while the Ops team can configure the mesh with minimal effort.\n\nJust like the example above, many such Meshery extension points are in Meshery to add logic into and add useful functionality. And as more of such extension points are added, Meshery will continue to give more and more power to your cloud native infrastructure.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Management with Meshery","date":"Jul 28th, 2022","author":"Ashish Tiwari","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/a66aa/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/65dd5/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/4fad6/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1366w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/a66aa/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/65dd5/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/4fad6/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1366w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery"}},{"id":"0bf099ea-9608-5c18-9882-81c42e07ea75","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport mesheryui from \"./mesheryui.webp\"; \n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a>'s goal is to make the operation of cloud native infrastructure and the service mesh layer of cloud simplified.

The following command creates aks cluster with a single node.\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">\naz aks create --resource-group MesheryGroup --name MesheryAKS --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys\n</code></pre>\nAfter a few minutes, the command completes and returns a JSON formatted information about the cluster.\nYou can connect with your cluster by using <code>az aks get-credentials</code> ,  which basically downloads credentials and configure the Kubernetes CLI.\n<pre><code>\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group MesheryGroup --name MesheryAKS\n</code></pre>\nVerify the connection to your cluster using the <code>kubectl get command</code>.\n<pre><code>\n$kubectl get nodes\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Install Meshery into your AKS cluster</h3>\n\n```\nhelm repo add meshery https://meshery.io/charts/\n\nhelm install meshery meshery/meshery --namespace meshery --create-namespace\n\n```\nMeshery server supports customizing authentication flow callback URL, which can be configured in the following way.\n<pre><code>\nhelm install meshery meshery/meshery --namespace meshery --set env.MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL=https://custom-host --create-namespace\n</code></pre>\nPort forward to Meshery UI\n```\nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace meshery -l \"app.kubernetes.io/name=meshery,app.kubernetes.io/instance=meshery\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\n\n$ kubectl --namespace meshery port-forward $POD_NAME 9081:8080\n\n```\nMeshery should now be running in your AKS cluster and the Meshery UI should be accessible at the specified endpoint you’ve exposed to. Navigate to the meshery service endpoint to log into Meshery.\n<div><img src={mesheryui} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"Meshery UI Dashboard\" /></div>\n\nFrom here, your Meshery deployment on AKS is ready to use. In order to login to Meshery, authenticate with your chosen provider from the list.\nThere are different ways to configure a Meshery on AKS. Join the <a href=\"https://layer5.io/community\">community</a> and share your deployment’s configuration on the <a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io/\"> discussion forum </a>today!\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How to deploy Meshery on AKS","date":"Jul 21st, 2022","author":"Srinivas Karnati","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/Meshery-on-AKS.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFipk0oJiOiMAgBABoJaACw7GYVobqX7FMxDIAA/qX3az11ecS2G7Ywek1haVMFjWlflvPlov5ZOXa13PEkNYdR0wgoGPwU0M3fO53QAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/f9756/Meshery-on-AKS.webp","srcSet":"/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/ee7ce/Meshery-on-AKS.webp 750w,\n/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/819dc/Meshery-on-AKS.webp 1080w,\n/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/f9756/Meshery-on-AKS.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/Meshery-on-AKS.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFipk0oJiOiMAgBABoJaACw7GYVobqX7FMxDIAA/qX3az11ecS2G7Ywek1haVMFjWlflvPlov5ZOXa13PEkNYdR0wgoGPwU0M3fO53QAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/f9756/Meshery-on-AKS.webp","srcSet":"/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/ee7ce/Meshery-on-AKS.webp 750w,\n/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/819dc/Meshery-on-AKS.webp 1080w,\n/static/3fe6493b7ebec3694bc03967df3a3a83/f9756/Meshery-on-AKS.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/how-to-deploy-meshery-on-aks"}},{"id":"e91a4e66-d3fb-575b-a5f1-6751b8e00a10","body":"import { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport aadityaFirstPr from \"./aaditya-first-pr.webp\"\nimport aadityaPresenting from \"./aaditya-presenting.webp\"\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### Early Interest in Coding \nI had a strong interest in computers growing up. I used to find it fascinating how computer programs operate because they have such a tremendous impact on their users. This has always motivated me to work in the field of computers.\n\nAs I grew up, I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more. I started exploring and made projects. The more I understood them, the more interesting they got. Slowly I realized that I don’t want to make projects that satisfy just my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open source projects. \n\n### First PR at Layer5 \nI still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I spotted a <code>[good first issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)</code> tag and expressed interest in working on it despite not knowing what the task was. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions, something I was unaware of at the time. After getting the issue assigned, I started researching what GitHub Actions were. I found out that these actions helped automate workflows to build, test, and deploy software. After getting the basics down, I checked if there were any existing GitHub Actions for the auto labeling of the PR. To my surprise, there were a couple of them. \n\nSo before actually making a PR, I experimented with the actions extensively in my private repo. I remember making about 20-25 PR in my private repo to get the auto labeler working fine. After verifying that I got the desired results, I made a PR. I also got to discuss my approach in the [Meshery Development Call](https://layer5.io/community/calendar). I was so nervous at that time since that was the first meeting I attended where I had to make people understand what I did and the strategies I used. I was quite thrilled when my code got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions. \n\n<img src={aadityaFirstPr} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya's first PR merged\" />\n\n### A Journey Never to forget \n\nMy Layer5 journey began with this small issue. I gradually started learning more about the projects and made some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned new technologies and techniques. Contributing to the codebase gave me so much exposure to React.js, which would not have been possible if I had done it on my own. I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time, I was comfortable with it. I am thankful that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing. I have always applied this principle, learning more by doing actual stuff rather than sitting there and getting stuck in the tutorial loop. \n\nAnother new technology I discovered was Jekyll, a static site generator. I was unfamiliar with this technology as well. I started contributing to issues involving Jekyll and slowly understood the basics and how the language works. I was very happy that I was able to make the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.meshery.io/project/compatibility-matrix), using Jekyll. Even my project for <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">GSoC</Link> is written in Jekyll. So, going from not knowing what Jekyll is, to making some big changes, did make me happy.  \n\nThe community also helped me boost my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meetings required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me get vocal and comfortable with talking to various people. \n\n<img src={aadityaPresenting} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya Presenting\" /> \n\nI am excited to be accepted as a <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</Link> Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. The project assigned to me is to create a dashboard on <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/dashboard\">SMP Website</a>. Results from the [CNCF Cluster labs](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/actions) will be displayed here graphically.  I wish to learn more about cloud native technologies and make contributions on the backend too. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can. \n\n### Appreciation for the Community \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Layer5 Community for always being so supportive whenever I needed it. I took away a very significant lesson from this experience, there is always something to learn, and there is no harm in asking questions if you don't know the answer. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community. There was not a day that I felt completely lost here, and that is what I adore about this community.\n\nKeep Meshing. Thank you.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Journey as a Contributor to GSoC Intern at Layer5","date":"Jul 6th, 2022","author":"Aaditya Narayan Subedy","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/my-journey-as-a-contributor-to-gsoc-intern-at-layer5"}},{"id":"de0c7552-7a04-5f35-8a06-4b6842d35504","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nHola folks,\nAs a contributor, each of us is always striving hard in the ocean to open more and more pull-requests, but being a contributor just doesn't mean only raising PRs, it also means reviewing other PRs, pointing out mistakes, helping others in improving the **code-quality/code-reusability/code-readability**, helping in finding missing edge-cases that haven't been tackled yet, giving your opinions, writing LGTM, CITY helps nothing but just improving the confidence and engagement of the PR author.\nSo put on your **Quality Tester** hats because here I'll talk about how to test the PRs with the label `component/mesheryctl` i.e. pull-requests related to `mesheryctl`.\n\nOkay before we start, I'll like to tell you about <a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli\">GitHub CLI</a>, it helps you checkout PRs very easily in your local system.\n<ol>\n    <li>The very first step is to **review the PR**, suggest changes if you think of any, ask queries, help the author to improve the code quality/readability/reusability, ask questions because asking helps you learn asking more better questions next time.</li>\n    <li>PR authors either attach a video showcasing expected behavior or add written instructions about their fix under **User Acceptance Behavior**.</li>\n    <li>Now it's the time to **checkout PR** in your local system, we can check out any PR like this:<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">gh pr checkout https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823</code></pre></li>\n    <li>You can check if you're into the same branch as the PR author with:<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">git branch</code></pre></li>\n    <li>Well, if we're testing a PR related to mesheryctl, we need to **build the binary** from the same branch. Change your directory to the `mesheryctl` folder and run:<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">make</code></pre>This will create a **mesheryctl binary** according to your OS in the same directory.</li>\n    <li>Now it's time to **test out this newly built binary** according to what's been tackled in the PR and related issues. For e.g. `system start` has some new functionality, make sure you followed the pull-request/linked-issue instruction for env setup, as sometimes fix/features are tackling an issue with a specific type of environment.<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">./mesheryctl system start</code></pre>the `./` helps us in using the newly built cli-binary present in the current directory which we built in 5th step.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n    <li>Make sure we have a similar experience as mentioned in the Video or the instructions added to the PR. But wait, is it okay to give green flags to the PR? not yet tbh. We as a tester should **turn a little evil** and think of the relevant situations/environments which might not have been tackled but should be (basically we're trying to **break the new feature/fix**).</li>\n    <li>After spending a good amount of time testing the new behaviors, old standard behaviors, new test cases, few edge cases. We can provide new insights to the PR author about the behavior in your system, depending on our experience we can ask the PR author to address our new queries, or we can appreciate the work, or give green flags to the PR.</li>\n</ol>\nWow, that was a ton of work there. Well being a **Tester** is tough but very important before we merge pull requests. Every PR should be marked green with **end-to-end testing** before merging, we as a project are using **GH Workflows** to perform standard golang-testing but manual end-to-end testing completely removes margins of error.\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Validating Meshery CLI Functionality","date":"Jun 10th, 2022","author":"Piyush Singariya","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/thumbnail.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAADwAgCdASoUAAcAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwCdADBsAAD+8CVGzfndbE6d1gAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16531/thumbnail.webp","srcSet":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/a4fab/thumbnail.webp 750w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16baf/thumbnail.webp 1080w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/5eb4b/thumbnail.webp 1366w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16531/thumbnail.webp 1895w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.36358839050131925}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/thumbnail.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAADwAgCdASoUAAcAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwCdADBsAAD+8CVGzfndbE6d1gAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16531/thumbnail.webp","srcSet":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/a4fab/thumbnail.webp 750w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16baf/thumbnail.webp 1080w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/5eb4b/thumbnail.webp 1366w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16531/thumbnail.webp 1895w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.36358839050131925}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/validating-meshery-cli-functionality"}},{"id":"d3755e16-1694-5614-8d5f-5fe6f590fc95","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\n\nimport oldDesign from \"./initial-design.webp\";\nimport newDesign from \"./mesheryctl-docs.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\nDocumentation plays a major role in any project. Even if the project is small or too big, the creator or the team behind the project needs to curate the documentation very well such that it'll be useful for new end users to refer and learn to use the project, troubleshoot the problems occurred and lot more. Thus, we, Layer5 have curated the documentation for Meshery to meet such purposes. Not to mention, <code>mesheryctl</code>, the CLI client of Meshery needs a curated documentation as well. This blog describes about the evolution of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page.\n</div>\n\n<h3>Initial Command Reference Design</h3>\nThe initial design of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page is all made using pure markdown and the functionality is handled using Jekyll, the main framework used for Meshery Docs. This handled great at initial stage but had many limitations, such as:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Updation of YAML for data is often required</li>\n        <li>Design was obselete at initial stage</li>\n        <li>No separate pages for each command and subcommand</li>\n    </ul>\n    Thus, the idea for redesigning the <code>mesheryctl</code> reference page was desperately needed.\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\" target=\"_parent\">\n    <img src = {oldDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Initial design of mesheryctl command reference\" /></a>\n<h3>Updated Command Reference Design</h3>\nTo tackle the shortcomings of the previous design, I was tasked to redesign the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page entirely. This was a big task at first glance to me, as I was a new contributor back then. Eventually after manipulating the reference section with help of great folks, I was able to pull off the task and the design was updated.\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\">\n<img src={newDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Meshery CLI command reference\" /></a>\n\nThe redesign work was done with help of HTML in markdown and with optimization in YAML code. A sample is given below.\n\n```shell\n    <!-- Copy this template to create individual doc pages for each mesheryctl commands -->\n\n    <!-- Name of the command -->\n    # mesheryctl mesh\n\n    <!-- Description of the command. Preferably a paragraph -->\n    ## Description\n\n    {% assign name = site.data.mesheryctlcommands.cmds[page.command] %}\n    {{ name.description }}\n\n    <!-- Basic usage of the command -->\n    <pre className=\"codeblock-pre\">\n    <div className=\"codeblock\">\n    mesheryctl mesh [flags] \n    </div>\n    </pre>\n    ...........\n```\n\n<h3>Adding auto generation feature in reference</h3>\n\nAs time passed, we realized that the command reference missed something for a while, though the design has been changed. Then, we thought the idea of automating the generation of docs such that developers don't need to change the code in docs section while working towards <code>mesheryctl</code>. That's where we got to know that Cobra library (the library for CLI apps made using golang) has a feature to make doc pages automatically. So we decided to incorporate that feature into <code>mesheryctl</code> docs page as well! After making several changes and a PR, I was finally able to introduce the feature in the docs site!\n\n```\nvar startCmd = &cobra.Command {\n\tUse:   \"start\",\n\tShort: \"Start Meshery\",\n\tLong:  `Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.`,\n\tArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\n\tExample: `\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n// (optional) skip checking for new updates available in Meshery.\nmesheryctl system start --skip-update\n// Reset Meshery's configuration file to default settings.\nmesheryctl system start --reset\n// Silently create Meshery's configuration file with default settings\nmesheryctl system start --yes\n.....\n}\n\t`,\n```\n\nUsing this information provided above in each golang file, the markdown page is generated using Cobra CLI library and thus reducing the workload on the developer by automating via <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/workflows/mesheryctl-ci.yml#L73\">GitHub Actions</a>.\n<br />\nThis is so far on how the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference is evolved for now. And I hope that it'll continue to evolve in the field of documentation to serve the users to use Meshery in best way possible.\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Meshery CLI Command Reference","date":"Jun 9th, 2022","author":"Aadhitya Amarendiran","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/evolution-of-the-meshery-cli-command-reference"}},{"id":"6f2b2a4d-337b-556e-9b63-7f45ddf1d976","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIt all started with my curiosity to find an open-source project with open issues with DevOps and CI/CD labels on them. \nWhile I was searching that on GitHub, I found <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, one of the projects at Layer5. I started going through the \n[README](https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme), and it just felt like that is it. \nIt integrates with all kinds of technologies that I ever wanted to learn and explore. Then I jumped onto their [slack](http://slack.layer5.io/) and got even \nmore excited by the enthusiasm and energy of each community members welcoming me in the newcomers channel. I started attending all the community meetings and \nlearned about the project through the demos/updates from fellow contributors. Slowly and gradually, I started contributing too, then delivering updates in the \ncommunity calls, and consequently started climbing the contributor ladder.\n\nWhen I realised that I would be working on [Layer5 Cloud](https://cloud.layer5.io) and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> as an LFX intern at Layer5, then I couldn't control my excitement. \nThat excitement was to ship more impactful features for the Layer5 projects, work and engage more deeply with the engineering team at Layer5 and have an overall \nupliftment of my development skills.  Throughout my internship I worked on several features. Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding \n[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">performance tests</Link>, \nsupporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, persisting <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with \nLayer5 Cloud, migrating Layer5 Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Layer5 Cloud and exposing performance profiles \n(generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) \nthrough a public facing API.\n\nIn terms of the learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past three months overpowers the education I received in the last two years of college, \nif we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. \nI learned and applied the tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, and NextJS to Postgres, SQL, and GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I got introduced to the topics like \nperformance engineering, service meshes, networking, and several cloud-native tool. While at the same time, I met several experienced developers who are very involved in \nthe communities which revolve around these realms.\n\nOne of the major realizations I got through this internship was that it is okay to make mistakes. There were a few instances where I made mistakes. \nFor instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query which depressed the whole production instance of Layer5 Cloud, which means no one would be able \nto log into Meshery until that gets fixed. Or once I unknowingly used an incorrect default SSH port in a workflow that failed a GitHub action responsible for \npushing the latest Layer5 Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But that was okay, and no one got mad at me, but rather I have \nalways received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I dont repeat it because that is all that matters.\n\nI had a great time as an intern @ Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PRs with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also \nlearned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also learned \nthe true meaning of team spirit. All in all, that was one of the most exquisite experiences I have ever had and ofcourse, the best internship experience \n(considering it was my first internship ever!). \n\nI will be engaged in this community and will keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"LFX Experience at Layer5 - Pranav Singh","date":"Jun 8th, 2022","author":"Pranav Singh","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/lfx-experience-at-layer5-pranav-singh"}},{"id":"e53b3eb0-0923-51eb-837a-f8d12f5a7fe8","body":"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport mentees from './mentees.webp'\nimport meshmate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-icon.svg\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\nTo newbies, open source contributions may seem daunting. In much the same way that non-techies develop a reverence for programmers courtesy of the film industry’s portrayal of them as wizards whose brains magically sprout up elaborate mathematical models and whose mouths eloquently spew technological jargon, so do newbies perceive contributors: a bunch of techies who debug in seconds, recite programming language documentation by heart and, well, create pull requests in their sleep (this is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point).\n</div>\n\n    This perception diminished any notion of our Stack Overflow and W3Schools-dependent selves ever having a shot at open source contribution. It often felt as if we haven’t attained the required caliber of ‘techie-ness’ requisite to join the erudite army of programming soldiers; that our match and stomps wouldn’t match the rhythm of these valiant sergeants.\n  <img src={mentees} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"layer5 mentees\" />\n    However, <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/programs/contributhon-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa’s Contributhon</a> program deconstructs this perception, moreso for women, by partnering with open source organizations like Layer5 and offering women the opportunity to receive mentorship that eases them into being ardent contributors.\n    After a rigorous selection process, we:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyindawodu\">Oyindamola Dawodu</a>, Frontend Developer\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edmucious\">Ednah Akoth</a>, Frontend Developer \n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  gained entry into SCA’s second contributhon program and would like to immerse you in the voyage that the contributhon program was through this article.\n  <h3>The Leaderboard Project</h3>\n    For 8 weeks, we have had the chance to immerse ourselves into Layer5’s open source contribution community by curating a leaderboard for <a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Layer5’s discussion forum</a> to show the most active participants based on various metrics such as likes received and posts created.\n    We built this leaderboard to encourage more intentional communication and exert positive peer pressure on community members, thereby subconsciously incentivising them to give more solutions to problems discussed on the forum, and actively engage with content posted by other members\n    The project has presented an immersive learning experience for us, right from learning how to navigate using the ubuntu terminal, learning how to set up a local discourse development environment and render web pages,  examining the discuss API documentation and understanding the API endpoints needed to fetch the required data and designing the UI (User Interface) of the leaderboard.\n  <h3>Challenges We Faced</h3>\n    Getting acclimated to the intricacies of the discourse development environment has been no easy feat. There were moments where we stared at code on discourse in utter oblivion on its purpose or functionality, or faced version issues that impeded our discourse instance’s ability to run. It sometimes got even more frustrating when something as simple as a fetch instruction that you have been writing for almost the entirety of your programming life fails to work and none of the Stack Overflow fixes work.\n    This question kept us going; How would we become the ardent <em>while in their sleep bug fixers</em> and prolific contributors if we don’t build the fortitude to weather such disheartening moments?\n     During moments like these, the Layer5 community, particularly <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</Link> and our mentors often saved the day, sharing resources or offering explanations on what ought to be done to salvage the situations.\n  <h3>Lessons We Learned Along the Way</h3>\n    Overall, the journey has exercised and built upon our skills repertoire in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Version Control, and induced us into the contribution workflow, right from finding an open issue to work on, setting up the required environment to developing the solution.\n    Furthermore, receiving feedback from both our mentors and members of the Layer5 community with regards to matters like the scalability of our data fetch methods, potential misuse of the leaderboard metrics to gain advantage, the converse outcome that our leaderboard could have (dishearten new members form contributing due to the seemingly low chance of their input reflecting on the board), more responsive UI fixes among others, helped us to become even more cognizant of the idea that we are developing not just for ourselves and our portfolios, but for a wider and greater audience.\n    We became more abreast with the idea of developing for a community or for a greater purpose and the imperative role of feedback in that development process. We became more comfortable with the idea that we essentially do not own the product despite all the sweat we pour into it; we are instead a part of a larger community that comes together to build a widely suitable, sustainable and inclusive product.\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\n    Through building this leaderboard for Layer5’s Community Forum, we have assimilated ourselves into the glorious match of soldiers that previously intimidated us. We stepped foot into the previously deemed insidious territory of open source contribution and realised that we too have a lot to offer in this ecosystem.\n    We have discovered a community of competent, supportive and serial problem-solvers, right from our mentors:\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n    <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/ekene-leonard-nwobodo\"><img src={meshmate} style={{ height: \"1.25rem\" }} /> Ekene Leonard Nwobodo</Link>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/etienejames5\">Etiene James</a>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\">Ruth Ikegah</Link>\n    </li>\n     <li>\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/atinuke-oluwabamikemi-kayode\">Oluwabamikemi Kayode</Link>\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n     to the entirety of the contributors, a knowledge powerhouse that we look forward to continue contributing and building towards.\n    Additionally, we would like to convey hearty regards to <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/\">She Code Africa</a> for availing this program as a stepping stone to women like us to get started in OSS. Their clarity in mission and vision execution and elaborate support structure has given a significant lift to women in Tech and curated a place where they can receive mentorship and the intellectual stimulation that necessitates and inevitably culminates to growth.\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"8 Weeks of Open Source Contribution with Layer5","date":"Jun 7th, 2022","author":"Ednah Akoth & Oyin Dawodu","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgYBAABXRUJQVlA4IPoAAACwBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpE0oJSOiKA1RABoJbACdL8JLA7AawLgEJUu1oG/8VqhBxNLD/6xY5QAA+GNTNuzYeCqf0KGmw+WANz2VbD75vWZ1/xthsSLZyp8VFejLxsmsjQk3Ru4p01AnMqeTxYnFtbsPTfbCTrToINiKXPQ44kBmb+/98B4irWb/Q4pL0P/U8HXIH7zE6SCkzZL+dX5xeP2ZvCaZ7wPypBcDARYZEFLaF+nOw1ZvYg75QPef92MHfwP9zjDjw3RJuzn5mJF0kyM/0Z8U5rgqcbC6xqFA2rIfW/nSximAUBtPO18c99u+8YOyNfyVKhK4AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","srcSet":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f03f/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 750w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgYBAABXRUJQVlA4IPoAAACwBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpE0oJSOiKA1RABoJbACdL8JLA7AawLgEJUu1oG/8VqhBxNLD/6xY5QAA+GNTNuzYeCqf0KGmw+WANz2VbD75vWZ1/xthsSLZyp8VFejLxsmsjQk3Ru4p01AnMqeTxYnFtbsPTfbCTrToINiKXPQ44kBmb+/98B4irWb/Q4pL0P/U8HXIH7zE6SCkzZL+dX5xeP2ZvCaZ7wPypBcDARYZEFLaF+nOw1ZvYg75QPef92MHfwP9zjDjw3RJuzn5mJF0kyM/0Z8U5rgqcbC6xqFA2rIfW/nSximAUBtPO18c99u+8YOyNfyVKhK4AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","srcSet":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f03f/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 750w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/8-weeks-of-open-source-contribution-with-layer5"}},{"id":"10d40198-40a0-5d1e-8617-a75e432b771e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\nimport BlockquoteAlt from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote/Blockquote-alt-style\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { PerfbytesPodcast } from \"./perfbytesPodcast\";\nimport ConsulDemo from \"./consul-docker-extension-demo.webp\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<PerfbytesPodcast>\n\n<h2>Podcast Insights</h2>\nMany questions were asked, answered, and a variety of topics were discussed.

Hosted by Henrik from Perfbytes and joined by Mark, <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\">Lee Calcote</Link> from Layer5 and Mrittika Ganguli from Intel. Tune in to find out more. Get answers to all community questions as a bonus.\n<h3>What is a service mesh?</h3>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nService mesh is one of the solutions that helps you to route traffic within your cluster so as to expose your services outside the cluster. It is a solution to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. You have different options like the service type load balancer or using ingress but service mesh makes sense because it will manage a lot of features around your service to service communication.\n\n</div>\n\nIn general, service meshes arose from the concept of proxies such as the NGINX proxy. Then Envoy was introduced by Lyft. Lyft had the architecture, and Google came along and created it. That gave us Istio, which is now part of CNCF. \n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"We were slugging it out in our labs trying to figure out how to do performance benchmarking with a service mesh. Instead of ten tools, if we had just one, it would be nice. Then we see Meshery come into the field\"\n  person=\"Mrittika\"\n/>\n\nService meshes, according to Lee, \"hit a real sweet spot personally\", having been focused on networking for most part of his career.\nHe believes that there are a couple of different ways to speak about the genesis of service meshes, with Linkerd being the first to coin the term.\nWe had Linkerd v1 written in scala and use jvm and then came Linkerd v2 which is something totally different at this point. It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed. There's a new one that's been softly announced in beta from called Cilium that is helping bring back some of the different architectures of how to run the proxies.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n\nThe way I prefer to think about a surface mesh is that it's all about resiliency.\nIf you were to take a three-tiered web or three-tiered app and you think about how you're breaking out those tiers with some amount of\nkind of vertical scaling,  you'd probably, end up putting at least a virtual IP address out in front of the whole web tier and then you've got an app tier and a database tier because you've got multiple instances of those things. Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\n\n</div>\n\nHenrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable. \nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\nHenrik recalled that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and when he first saw Meshery, his immediate thought was, \"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\"\n\n\nLets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n\n<h3>Meshery</h3>\nIf you were on a pager and were managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff. You might soil myself if you had to go make a change in that sea of yaml. That's in part what we're working towards. There's a capability within Meshery for solving this challenge. As a cloud native management plane, Meshery presides over top of 10 different types of service meshes and it also presides over kubernetes. You can run it outside of kubernetes or inside of kubernetes.\nMeshery has a number of components to its architecture. There is Meshery UI. It has a Mesheryctl, which is a CLI component. We have a number of service mesh adapters for each service mesh that Meshery supports.\n<h5>What is the need for different adapters?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nMeshery, as the multi-mesh manager, supports couple of different adapters. Adapters are used by Meshery to manage the numerous service meshes. Different service mesh adapters are written to expose the unique value of each service mesh. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each service mesh is not equally capable as the other. Some of them work in a similar way. Some of the service meshes have their own differentiated value, which is why there are individual adapters. Some of them work slightly differently depending on whether they're running as a managed service or not.\n\n</div>\n\n\nWe have a plug-in for Meshery it's called <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>, it is what you might consider a visual topology. It has a lot of use cases for observing in kind of a read-only mode. There's a second mode to this tool: The Designer Mode. It's a visual configurator of not only the specific settings within any of those service meshes that it supports like a circuit breaker and adjusting the sensor video\nbut also end up being a visual designer for your kubernetes deployments. When users drop in, they're able to go over and grab the specific capabilities of any of those service mesh adapters that are loaded for any of the versions of that mesh that they might want to design. The concept here is that they drag and drop these capabilities over and there's a bit of discoverability that's afforded through this ui rather than parsing through yaml, trying to understand what's going on.\n\n<img src={ConsulDemo} alt=\"Consul MeshMap Demo\" className=\"slides-right\"/>\n\nI like to pretend that I know a lot about service meshes, but when it comes to having to keep track of all of them, I don't know what the gateway tls sds config is, and so this type of inline help is quite useful to design your deployments. The deployments may or may not use a mesh; in fact, you can use this to create your Kubernetes configuration and deployment as well.  You can even save and recall those designs.\n\nTaking this example of consul, produced by hashicorp, is a little more of an\nintriguing deployment and a simple two-tier deck.  We announced the <Link to=\"/docker-extension-meshery\">Meshery Docker Extension</Link> recently. So if you're using docker desktop, Meshery will be a first class app that's available inside of market and part of what it does as it integrates with docker desktop is it will import docker compose apps convert them to kubernetes manifests or kubernetes apps and they'll let you deploy those formerly docker compose apps onto a mesh which is why I'm talking about a two-tiered service.\n\n<h5>Does MeshMap allow you to load the current configuration that is has been applied in the current cluster?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nCurrently, there are two modes: the one we were looking at before was the designer mode, and the one we'll be looking at now is the visualizer mode, which is probably a little more of an it's not entirely read-only to the extent that you could grab a pod and start an interactive session with the containers in that pod or you could you start a logging session. You could also initiate a performance test against  that particular service or that particular endpoint. \nMeshery supports three different types of load generators, which is a nighthawk, fortio and wrk2. \n\n</div>\n\n<h5>What are the capabilities of these three load generators? When you speak about service mesh testing or performance testing, what is actually the process behind the scene? What should users think about when they're starting a gig and need to configure and optimize the service mesh?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nLee expounds on that for our benefit. \nIt takes weeks to months that you've got to dedicate for performance engineers to go over and like pull together various tools and scripts around them to then get into a spreadsheet or into some database that you then generate results. \nThe genesis of Meshery part was to help people comprehend what a service mesh is, when to use one and which one to use?  As you go to explain these common questions, the real answer is a totally disappointing, which is, it just depends on what you're asking to do.\nPeople want to measure it in cold hard quantitative metrics but if you're asking to do 100 percent sampling then also consider the distributed tracing implementation you had somewhere else and the fact that you're getting it\nin a uniform way here. Maybe you're likely to consider the overhead that you would have over there. It's frustrating to be trying to explain stuff to folks and get them excited about the tech and and to give them a vague response. Instead we give them a tool that says \"Hey look here's a tool that will deploy any of the service meshes that you want to test out.\"\nThere's a reason why there's ten of them like and actually many more than that.\nThere's a lot of overlap between them but different tools for different purposes for different size orgs, so it would be inappropriate to say well you know here's the one. It's rather hey here's a tool that that lets you deploy any number of them quickly, answer your own question about performance, because we can pump out benchmarks of the various service meshes under various configurations, using different types of workloads but which may or may not match your environment and over time those reports are going to get stale and so rather he's a tool to make you empowered.\n\n</div>\n\n<h5>Do you actually generate traffic that will go through the sidecar proxy of the service and then reach out the actual service?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nThat load is generated on demand or on schedule against one or more endpoints, one or more of your services or something that is not even on your service. You can generate load not only against something running within your infrastructure but something external as well to do statistical analysis based on the configuration that you gave it and so yeah the answer is yes the traffic flows through the sidecar.\n\n</div>\n\n<h5>If I say I have never scripted or built any scenarios for fortio or nighthawk. Let's say I'm a loadrunner, a neoload, or a k6 user, and I want to accomplish the same thing with them. So what is the journey on those load generator? is it the same thing you have to build a workflow of requests that you want to send in that scenario?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n\nThat leads us to probably talk about one of our other projects which is called <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\"> Performance</Link> which is a specification. It's another one of the projects that we've donated to the CNCF. Service Mesh Performance is the spec while Meshery is an implementation of the spec. \nAt a high level, if those other load generators were to adhere to how we standardize and describe the test that you want to run and then hand off that configuration to generate the performance profiles that are created here  you're not gonna down download them but the descriptor is important.\nThis implements a standard for the industry on what is the actual\nservice mesh test and then standardize the format so then anyone can use the same format to design their script or whatever they want and then use it to test. \nSo when I build a script, and I don't know loadrunner today and I want to use neologo tomorrow, then I don't have to rewrite everything. Great!\n\n</div>\n\nMissed the podcast? No worries, we got you covered.

Not sure why your Envoy configuration isn't working? If you're using Istio as your gateway and need to troubleshoot your ingress traffic requests, here are a few tips for debugging Envoy proxy.\n<h2>Enable Envoy Debug Logging</h2>\n  By default Envoy system logs are sent to <code>/dev/stderr</code>. This location be overridden using <code>--log-path</code>. Logging to <code>/dev/stderr</code>  for system logs and to <code>/dev/stdout</code> for access logs can be useful when running Envoy inside a container. In this way, these two individual logstreams can be separated, and using this approach, logging requires no additional files or directories to be mounted.\n<div className=\"intro\">\n  We recommend setting the Envoy proxy’s log level to debug in a pre-production environment. Debug logs can help you identify issues before you graduate the associated configuration to your production environment.\n</div>\n<h3>Using envoy CLI</h3>\n  The envoy command has a <code>--log-level</code> flag that can be useful for debugging. By default, it’s set to info. To change it to debug, edit the envoy DaemonSet in the istio-system namespace and replace the <code>--log-level info</code> flag with <code>--log-level debug</code>. Setting the Envoy log level to debug can be particilarly useful for debugging TLS connection failures.\n<h3>Using container image</h3>\n  If you’re using the Envoy image, you can set the log level to debug through the <code>ENVOY_LOG_LEVEL</code> environment variable. The log level for Envoy system logs can be set using the <code>-l</code> or <code>--log-level</code> option.\nThe available log levels are:\n\n<ul>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>trace</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>debug</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>info</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>warning/warn</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>error</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>critical</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{ width: \"fit-content\" }}>off</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe default is <span className=\"highlight\">info</span>.\n\n<h3>Setting Envoy logs in the Helm configuration</h3>\n\n  The Consul helm chart uses <code>envoyExtraArgs:</code> to leverage Envoy command line options. One of the helpful options is <code>--component-log-level</code>. This provides granular control over setting log levels for Envoy components. In the example below, the components upstream, http, router and config are set to the debug log level. These four components are vital when debugging issues with requests between your services(sidecar proxies).\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>connectInject:\n  enabled: true\n  envoyExtraArgs: \"--component-log-level upstream:debug,http:debug,router:debug,config:debug\"</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n  If you haven't set envoyExtraArgs: in consul-values.yaml just yet, you can set the log levels on the fly by using the following kubectl command:\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl exec pod/pod-name -c container-name -- curl -X POST http://localhost:19000/logging?config=debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\nExample:\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl exec pod/static-client-5bf4575d9c-zr2b -c static-client -- curl -X POST  http://localhost:19000/logging?config=debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n  You will execute the kubectl command for each component. Make sure to append the correct component at the end of the curl command, i.e. <code>logging? component = debug</code>.\n  If curl is not able to be used in your pod, you can alternatively use <code>kubectl port-forward pod-name 19000</code> to make the Envoy admin accessible. From another terminal window, you can then curl to change the log levels. The output you receive in the terminal will show the modified component log levels.\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ curl -X POST http://localhost:19000/logging? component = debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n<h3>Access Envoy logs in Kubernetes</h3>\n\nAccessing Envoy logs via pods can be done with the following command:\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl logs --follow pod/ pod-name -c envoy-sidecar</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\nThe --follow flag provides a real time observation into Envoy logs.\n<h3>Setting and Accessing Envoy logs when not using Helm.</h3>\n\nThe following command will start an envoy side car proxy, set the log level to debug with -l debug and capture Envoy logs in envoy_logs.txt. The .txt file will need to be created before executing this command.\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ consul connect envoy -sidecar-for counting-1 -- -l debug --log-path envoy_logs.txt</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\nTo have granular control over the Envoy components that is needed to be debugged, use the following command:\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ consul connect envoy -sidecar-for counting-1 -- --log-path envoy_logs.txt --component-log-level upstream:debug,http:debug,router:debug,config:debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Find your Istio Ingress Gateway</h2>\n  With Istio as your gateway, you should first look at <code>VirtualService</code> objects. These can show if the hosts are registered to the gateway correctly.\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl get virtualservice -o=yaml</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n  However, sometimes, the <a  className=\"highlight\" href=\"https://envoyproxy.io\">Envoy</a> inside the gateway container is not properly configured (likely due to a bug). You can dump Envoy configuration to debug this further.\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code># find istio ingress gateway pod \\\n      $ kubectl get pods -n istio-system -l app=istio-ingressgateway</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n  Let's use <code>istio-ingressgateway-a93019f9dfw-l39xd</code> as an example pod name.\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>\n      # enable debugging on envoy \\\n      $ kubectl exec --namespace=istio-system \\\n      istio-ingressgateway-a93019f9dfw-l39xd \\\n      -c istio-proxy -- curl -X POST \\\n      http://localhost:15000/logging?level=debug\n    </code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n  Then, use <code>istioctl</code> tool to dump route configuration (this will show the output from the <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface-config-dump\"><code>/config_dump</code> admin endpoint</a> on Envoy):\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>\n    $ istioctl proxy-config routes -n istio-system -o=json \\\n      istio-ingressgateway-a93019f9dfw-l39xd\n    </code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n  We hope these steps are useful to you.

This enables:\n\n- Baselines  \n- Benchmark comparisons  \n- System-to-system exchange of performance data  \n\n---\n\n## Mrittika Ganguli introduces MeshMark with an example\n\nMeshMark measures whether the performance of your infrastructure aligns with the value your deployment is intended to provide.\n\n<Blockquote\n  className=\"pull-right\"\n  quote=\"Are my resources utilized as best as possible?

MeshMark intends to help provide an index for many of these areas.\"\n  person=\"Mrittika Ganguli\"\n/>\n\n<p>\nOften when loading a YouTube video, text appears before the video.

I gained much technical knowledge as well as soft skills in these 9 months. I spend most of my time working on the UI of Meshery and its various projects. \n   In terms of technical items I learned React, Docker, Kubernetes, new JavaScript concepts, etc.\n  I would say Layer5 is the best in terms of work ethics, community management, a healthy work environment, and a lot more. \n  You can gain real-life working experience on such big projects and guidance related to your career.\n<h2 id=\"learnings-at-Layer5\">How I landed an internship at Layer5?</h2>\n  I gradually started learning about the project and made myself choose one area to start with and continued to explore further. I kept pushing myself with patience until I feel strong and capable enough to\n  take responsibilities and give my best to the community, Then I asked and applied for an internship and eventually, I got selected.\nNow I can make more impact and grow more under the right guidance.😃\n<h2 id=\"apart-from-coding\">Apart from coding</h2>\n  Besides coding at Layer5, I made many new friends, great experiences, and memories.\n  At last, I would say, join this amazing community and experience the change in yourself.

Cloud native architectures call for horizontally scalable, distributed systems design with microservices proliferated from Cloud to Edge. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network’s objective is to enable widespread and effective development, deployment, and operation of resilient and intelligent network systems in cloud native environments, keeping an eye on the needs of workloads, developers who design them, and operators who manage them.\n    Lee Calcote (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lcalcote\">@lcalcote</a>) is an innovative product and technology leader, passionate about empowering engineers and enabling organizations. As the founder and CEO of Layer5, he is at the forefront of the cloud native movement. Ken Owens (<a href =\"https://twitter.com/kenowens12\">@kenowens12</a>) is the Vice President, Cyber Cloud Security Engineering at FISERV. Owens is a technologist and an innovator with more than 20+ years of experience in a plethora of technologies and has been championing the cloud native movement for more than a decade now.\n    As an introduction to TAG Network, Owens  describes  the group’s  core objectives and reasons for its formation, summarized below:\n<ul>\n<li>Listening to ideas and collaborations</li>\n<li>Assisting and attracting projects</li>\n<li>Building communities and providing impartial stewardship</li>\n</ul>\n    Calcote and Owens are frequently asked a common question <em>“Is it important for the organization to be a part of CNCF to participate in the TAG Network group?”</em>. Owens emphasizes that anyone can participate, regardless of whether or not their company is a CNCF member organization. It does not require any payment and is an open-source effort in its spirit.\n<h3>CNCF TAG Network Projects and various stages they go through:</h3>\n<img src={Projects} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Tag Networks Projects\" />\n\n    One of the important goals of the TAG Network is to identify the unique projects that want to participate and shepherd their journey through CNCF project levels. Project-fit and the process of assessment for inclusion in the CNCF require your project to be on terms with the following essential traits:\n<ul>\n<li>Uniqueness</li>\n<li>Problem it solves</li>\n<li>Value it brings to the community</li> \n<li>Market demand</li>\n<li>Diversification </li>\n</ul>\n    Creating and stewarding any one of these projects is a significant undertaking. The  project's maintainers pitch the project and explicate how their project meets the above traits.\n    You start in a sandbox and work your way up to an incubation area once you've demonstrated a fundamental interest and understanding of the space, as well as some adoption. To graduate, the project must satisfy the required traits, be open-source, provide value and solve a problem effectively. We don't want to promote a CNCF project that is solely driven by one source. Diversification is crucial to the core of any CNCF project. Owens shared a subtle analogy, <em>\"a truly open source project is one in which contributors belong to the companies A+B+C...Z instead of just company A\"</em>\n<h4>Working Groups and papers, and how they work.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Data Plane API and Service Mesh WG are the two working groups stewarded by TAG Network.</li>\n<li>They utilize Kubecon to educate about the functioning of working groups.</li>\n<li>Whitepapers and publications are carried out by working group members. A Recent publication was published in the IEEE Bridge magazine, entitled <Link to=\"/resources/service-mesh-performance/analyzing-service-mesh-performance\">Analyzing Service Mesh Performance</Link>.</li>\n<li>Further goals include getting into the IEEE Communications Society and publishing an article entitled Techniques of Service Mesh Optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe majority of the more detailed activities occur in the CNCF Service Mesh Working Group - a subgroup of TAG Network. The deep-dive unveiled many individual initiatives, the majority of which have a common thread: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Meshery is the cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of workloads.\n\n    It's a Meshy world out there! As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. Calcote gives us a walkthrough of two Service Mesh Specifications:\n<ul>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI):</Link></b> SMI focuses on the interoperability of the various features of a service mesh.</li>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance (SMP):</Link></b> SMP tries to make it uniform and succinct the way you characterize the performance of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes.</li>\n</ul>\n<img src={Smi} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{ marginLeft: \"10px\" }} alt=\"SMI\" />\n<img src={Smp} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{ marginLeft: \"10px\" }} alt=\"SMP\" />\n    Owens and Calcote also discuss <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link> and Service Mesh Catalog. These patterns promote the reuse of best practices, are service mesh agnostic, and also help in behavior analysis. A circuit breaker test is a good example.  If something goes wrong in your network be it a node failure, router failure, etc., then it helps you identify the point of failure as well as gets your network running quickly.\n<img\n    src={Catalog}\n    className=\"slides\"\n    alt=\"Service Mesh Catalog\"\n    style={{ display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\" }}\n/>\n\n\n    Talking about distributed systems, we come across the problem of distributed analysis. In this talk, the TAG Network co-chairs help us understand this problem and why we must worry about it.\n<ul>\n<li>Many performance characterizing tools are limited to single instance load generators. This limits the amount of traffic and the variety of behavioral analysis.</li>\n<li>Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles.</li>\n<li>How to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before deploying to production. </li>\n</ul>\n    This brings us to <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Together they help produce robust, distributed and scalable services. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.\n<img\n    src={Gnh}\n    className=\"slides\"\n    style={{ display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\" }}\n    alt=\"GetNighthawk\"\n />\n\n<strong>Calcote and Owens packed a great deal of information in this talk.

Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components.\nHigh levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.\n<h3> mesheryctl lines of code</h3>\n\n\n```yaml\n\n    270 text files.\n    106 unique files.\n    166 files ignored.\n\n    cloc v 1.92  T=0.15 s (692.3 files/s, 110063.3 lines/s)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Language       files          blank        comment           code\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Go                88           2128           1330          13045\n    YAML              12              0              0            215\n    JSON               4              0              0             42\n    make               1             10              2             31\n    Markdown           1             23              0             27\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    SUM:             106           2161           1332          13360\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nUnit Tests can be written in two ways:\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand\n        <ol>\n            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>\n            <li>Grab console output</li>\n            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>\n            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>\n            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>\n            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions\n        <ol>\n            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>\n            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example tree graph</h3>\nThis example of a tree graph (from <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823\">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.\n<img src={TreeGraph} />\n\n<h3>Integration Tests</h3>\n\nIntegrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.\nThe integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.\n<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>\n\nWriting tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and Clouds.\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/\">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>\n    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>\n    <li>Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq\">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>. This guide will briefly introduce how tests are supposed to be written for mesheryctl.</li>\n    <li>Contributing to Tests doesn’t always mean writing new tests, It also means improving the effectiveness of already written-ones.</li>\n    <li> Search for Issues marked with area/tests in <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery\">GitHub - meshery/meshery</a>: Meshery, the cloud native management plane.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe impact that you make with by writing even a single test is quite high. Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?\nSo, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review!

Let’s examine what each specification provides.\n<img src={smpLogo} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" alt=\"service mesh performance logo\"/><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance</a> standardizes service mesh value measurement, characterizing any deployment's performance by capturing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration and workload metadata.\n<img src={smiLogo} className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"service mesh interface logo\"/><a href=\"https://smi-spec.io\">Service Mesh Interface</a> provides a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. These (currently) four specfications offer a common denominator set of interfaces to support most common service mesh use cases and the flexibility to evolve to support new service mesh capabilities over time.\nAs a service mesh agnostic tool that provides lifecycle and performance management of a large number of (10+) service meshes, Kubernetes applications, service mesh patterns and WebAssembly filters, Meshery is the ideal tool for the job when it comes to implementing these specifications.\nMeshery also comes with two new GitHub Actions that do exactly this. The <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smi-conformance-action\">Meshery SMI Conformance Action</a> which <a href=\"https://meshery.io/blog/validating-smi-conformance-with-meshery\">validates SMI conformance</a> in your pipeline and the <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action\">Meshery SMP Action</a> which runs <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management\">SMP compatible performance benchmarks</a>.\nBut how do we use these actions? What do they offer? Let’s find out!\n<h2>Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action</h2>\n\nConformance of SMI specifications is defined as a series of test assertions. These test assertions are categorised by SMI specification (of which, there are currently four specifications) and comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. Conformance requirements will change appropriately as each new version of the SMI spec is released. Refer to Meshery's documentation for details of how <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/service-mesh-interface\">Meshery performs SMI conformance</a>.\n<img src={githubBlack} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" style={{maxWidth:\"9vw\"}}/>\n\n<h3>Using Meshery's SMI Conformance GitHub Action</h3>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/service-mesh-interface-conformance-with-meshery\">Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action</a> is available in the GitHub Marketplace. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event.\nAn example of the action configuration which runs on every release is shown below. The action handles setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying the service mesh (see supported service meshes), running the conformance tests and reporting back the results to the SMI Conformance dashboard in Meshery.\n```yaml\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: false\n```\n\nYou can also bring in their own cluster with specific capabilities and with a service mesh already installed.\n```yaml\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - 'master'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance tests on master\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Install OSM\n        run: |\n           curl -LO https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/v0.9.1/osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           tar -xzf osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           mkdir -p ~/osm/bin\n           mv ./linux-amd64/osm ~/osm/bin/osm-bin\n           PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/osm/bin/\"\n           osm-bin install --osm-namespace default\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: true\n```\n\nYou can download a token from Meshery and add it as a GitHub secret (in the example above, the secret is <code>MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN</code>). After the test is run, you can view the results from the Service Mesh Interface dashboard in Meshery UI.\n<p style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}><img src={smidashboard} className=\"image-center-shadow\" style={{width:\"70%\"}} alt=\"smi conformance dashboard\" /></p>\n<i>Meshery's Service Mesh Interface Conformance Results</i>\nParticipating projects can also automatically report their conformance test results to the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/service-mesh-interface\">SMI Conformance dashboard</a>\n\n<h2>Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</h2>\n\nMeasuring and managing the performance of a service mesh is key to efficient operation of any service mesh. Meshery is the canonical implementation of the Service Mesh Performance specification. You can choose from multiple load generators and use a highly configurable set of load profiles with variable tunable facets to run a performance test. Meshery packages all these features into an easy-to-use GitHub Action.\n<img src={githubBlack} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" style={{maxWidth:\"9vw\"}}/>\n\n<h3>Using Meshery's Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</h3>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/performance-testing-with-meshery\">Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</a> is available in the GitHub Marketplace.You can create your own performance profiles to run repeatable tests with Meshery. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event. A sample configuration of the action is shown below.\n```yaml\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n```\n\nYou can also define your test configuration in an SMP compatible configuration file as shown below.\n```yaml\nsmp_version: v0.0.1\nid:\nname: Istio Performance Test\nlabels: {}\nclients:\n- internal: false\n  load_generator: fortio\n  protocol: 1\n  connections: 2\n  rps: 10\n  headers: {}\n  cookies: {}\n  body: \"\"\n  content_type: \"\"\n  endpoint_urls:\n  - http://localhost:2323/productpage\nduration: \"30m\"\n```\n\nSee this sample GitHub workflow (<a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/blob/master/action.yml\">action.yml</a>) for more configuration details.\n<img src={perfdashboard} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"performance management dashboard\"/>\n\nThe results from the tests are updated on the Performance Management dashboard in Meshery.

Architecturally, a service mesh consists of two\n  planes. One of those is the data plane, while the other one is the control\n  plane. A service mesh data plane is the collection of intelligent proxies that\n  operate in unison under the coordination of the control plane. The control\n  plane performs configuration management of these intelligent proxies.\n  A management plane can do many things. Essentially, a management plane helps\n  you integrate cloud native infrastructure into your backend systems. A robust management\n  plane allows you to take full advantage of the power of the network while\n  integrating your service delivery processes seamlessly. Your management plane\n  might federate different types of infrastructure, help you instigate chaos\n  through controlled experiments, or offer automated traffic splitting in order\n  to execute different styles of canarying of your applications. Your management\n  plane might offer deep insights into the performance of your applications and\n  to the performance of your infrastructure or might deliver a change in\n  management framework.\n<h3>\n  <img\n    src={MesheryLogo}\n    align=\"center\"\n    alt=\"meshery-logo\"\n    height=\"35rem\"\n    width=\"35rem\"\n    style={{paddingBottom:\"5px\", paddingTop:\"auto\"}}/>{\" \"}\n  Meshery\n</h3>\n\n<img\n  src={MeshManager}\n  className=\"slides-left\"\n  align=\"right\"\n  alt=\"mesh-manager\"/>\n  <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> manages the\n  lifecycle of infrastructure.

In the future, if you want to\n  deploy a web assembly filter, you can describe that in a pattern as well and\n  have Meshery apply it. The patterns are infrastructure agnostic, they're\n  reusable and the initial set of them is being stored in a public-facing\n  repository.

In this talk, he walked through service mesh specifications and why they matter in your deployment.\n   How many service mesh specifications do you know? He went through all of them. So, no worries if you're unfamiliar.\n\n</div>   \n\n### Service Mesh Specifications:\n<img src={Abstractions} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"abstractions\"/>\n\nAs the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. The Service Mesh Interface (SMI), the Service Mesh Performance (SMP), and Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) are three open specifications solving the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service meshes. \n\nLearn what makes each of them unique and why they are much needed. See each of these three specifications in action as we use Meshery, the open-source service mesh management plane to demonstrate the value and functionality of each service mesh abstraction, and the adherence of these specifications by Istio, Linkerd, Consul and other popular service meshes.\n\n### Cloud native Journey to service meshes:\n\n<img src={Journey} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"journey-image\"/>\n\nThe advent of cloud native was the popularization of containers. Thank you Docker! From there, containers took off like wildfire. Turns out you need an orchestrator to wrangle that sprawl. We saw a number of orchestrators come and we still have a number of orchestrators around.\n\nService meshes have become a hot topic in the last few years. They still continue to be, rightfully so, a very powerful piece of technology. “A lot of the power is yet to come from my perspective. For my part, I believe that there is a tomorrow in which data plane intelligence really matters. And matters about how people write cloud native applications.”, Lee emphasized. Not everyone quite understands the capabilities of meshes as they are promoted and spoken about today. So come along into the journey of service mesh.\n\nThere are a number of service meshes out there. One of the community projects is to track the landscape of all of the meshes there are. There’s a lot to say about each of them, their architecture, and their working. Why are they made? Who are they focused on? What do they do? When did they come about? Why are some of them not here anymore? Why are we still seeing new ones? A lot of things to go through. You might be interested in any number of the details that the landscape tracks.\n <div className=\"note\">Be Aware, It's Meshy Out There!</div>\n\n### Service Mesh Interface\n<img src={SMI} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"smi-image\"/>\n- Its goal and genesis were born inside of Kubernetes.\n- Being a specification that is native to Kubernetes, its focus is on lowest common denominator functionality.\n- The focus on bringing forth APIs that highlight and reinforce the most common use cases that service meshes are being used for currently\n- Leaves space and provides extensibility room for additional APIs to address other service mesh functionality as more people adopt and make use cases well known.\n- There are seven service meshes that claim compatibility with SMI. There's been a community effort, open-source effort to create service mesh conformance tests to assert whether or not a given service mesh is compatible with SMI\n- In order to facilitate those types of tests, you need to have a tool to provision a sample application on those services which will generate load and test whether traffic splitting behaves as expected or works with that service mesh implementation properly.\n- Then you need to be able to collect the results, guarantee the provenance of those results and publish them.\n- As a community, we turned to Meshery as the tool to implement <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link> and we have been working with the individual service meshes to validate their conformance.\n<b>Meshery</b>\n- We work on an open-source project called <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n- Meshery, the cloud native management plane, is the canonical implementation of the service mesh performance.\n- The management planes can do a number of things to help bridge the divide between other back-end systems and service meshes. They also help performance management, configuration management, making sure you are following best practices in your implementations by taking common patterns and applying them to your environment\nLet's take a moment to demo what it looks like to validate conformance in SMI using Meshery.\n\n<img src={Graph} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"graph\"/>\n- We need to spin up Meshery locally\n- We use mesheryctl as the command line interface to work with Meshery.\n- We can interact with a number of different service mesh. The service mesh we’re going to work with today is an Open service mesh (one of those 7 that is compatible with SMI). Let’s put it to the test.\n- We'll initiate <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link>\n- These tests go and do assertions across these different specifications. We’re looking at traffic access, traffic splitting, traffic specification. Meshery then collects these results and will eventually be publishing them in combination with the SMI project.\n\n### Service Mesh Performance\n<img src={SMP} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"smp-image\"/>\n- Focused on describing and capturing the performance of a service mesh.\n- The overhead of the value is another way of looking at it and characterizing it.\n- Trying to characterize the performance of the infrastructure of a service mesh can be really difficult.\n- Considering the number of variables that you would have to track, how difficult it can be to have repeatable tests, and benchmark your environment, to track your history based on your environment, compare performance between other meshes people need.\n- SMP creates a standard way of capturing the performance of the mesh to help with these issues.\n- It's also the way in which you're configuring your control plan of your service mesh.\n\nYou might be using a client library to do some service mesh functionality. Maybe you're using those in combination with the service mesh. What costs more? What's more efficient? What's more powerful? Maybe you're using web assembly and filters there.\nThese are all open questions that <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">SMP</Link> assists in answering in your environment. You’d be surprised by some of the results of some tests that we have done and that the community has done in combination with a couple of universities and graduate students.\n\n<b>Performance Test</b>\n\nDemonstration of the implementation of service mesh Performance:\n\n<img src={Flowchart} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"flowchart\"/>\n- On the terminal, we have a local deployment of Meshery running. You can also deploy on Kubernetes as well as the vendor Kubernetes platforms like AKS, EKS and GCP or you can use a dockerized container to run Meshery. You can also have your Kubernetes on Docker desktop.\n- We have the Open service mesh deployed.\n- The Meshery UI is exposed at 9081 port. This is the UI which is used to instantiate a Load test.\n- Over here you can see we have 3 load generators fortio, wrk2, nighthawk.\n- All of these load generators have their own set of attributes which they record correctly and each of its attributes have their own significance. We begin with fortio.\n- <img src={Bucket} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"graph\"/>\n\n- You can actually download the test results or you can just browse into the Results Tab and see all of the tests which you have run until now.\n- Next, we used nighthawk to generate the load and benchmark the service for the same. Nighthawk is a load generator which is maintained by the Envoy community and is relatively new. It still hasn't got its 1.0 release but right now Nighthawk has sufficient features to compete with different generators which are still in the play. It can generate a gRPC service on its own and it has some more attributes which you can expose using their CLI tools.\n- You can also see that Meshery has the capability to search your environment, see what specifications are being used and what's the load on your Kubernetes.\n- Jump into the results Tab and see how we compare with these results.\n- You can click on the download.

These are things that Hamlet addresses.\n- The specification currently consists of two APIs:\n    - **The Federated Resource Discovery API**: API to authenticate and securely distribute resources between federated service meshes.\n    - The **Federated Service Discovery API**: API to discover, reach, authenticate and securely communicate with federated services.\n- Part of the real power is the ability to overcome what are likely to be separate administrative domains. The intention here is to marry up connect two disparate service mesh deployments, those deployments might be of the same type, they might be of two different types.\n\nIn addition to SMI, SMP and Hamlet there has been an emergence of service mesh patterns, by which people are running and operating service meshes. There is a service mesh working group under CNCFs network that is helping identify those patterns of which there's a list right now unbeknownst to you. Reach out, join it, help us work through the 60 patterns that are defined right now. 30 of those are going into an <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books\">O’Reilly</Link> book called <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link>.\n\nSomething that isn’t always obvious to folks is this piece of value that people get from a service mesh and actually from the specifications that we were just mentioning. It is the fact that teams are decoupled when you’re running a mesh. Developers get to iterate a bit independently of operators, and so do operators get to make changes to implement infrastructure to the way that applications behave independent of developers in the presence of a mesh.  Both of these teams are significantly empowered. Everybody gets a piece of power when they deploy a mesh.\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite  come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter","date":"Sep 20th, 2021","author":"Debopriya Bhattacharjee","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/service-mesh/service-mesh-specifications-and-why-they-matter"}},{"id":"6b3908f1-2736-5322-a4e3-c3e864fd6d66","body":"\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\nimport Nithish from \"./nithish-karthik.webp\";\nimport Ashish from \"./ashish-tiwari.webp\";\nimport Rudraksh from \"./rudraksh-pareek.webp\";\nimport Bariq from \"./bariq-nurlis.webp\";\n\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n\n  Layer5 participates in many <Link className=\"blog\" to=\"/careers/programs\">open source internship programs</Link>.

Like how most people formulate what and how they will do in the uni, I also came from normalcy. In Singapore, students are aiming to get the best mark in every possible lesson in college as our grades hold a very high importance in the culture. Going back and forth between classes, planning a startup with my peers, volunteering in community clubs, I had a spectacular two years in uni.\nHowever, during the last summer break, I started asking myself questions. How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you’re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad. Frankly, the experience wasn’t as good as I expected. Trying to pinch my way in a Google Summer of Code project, I am overwhelmed by numerous people trying to do the same.\n  I thought open source would be like this all the time and it failed me. But then, I took my second chance and joined Layer5. First two weeks, I tried to familiarize myself with the project and joined in the community calls. I remember sharing my screen the first time in the community call, and it was thrilling, my hands can't stop shaking. I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don't mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty. My thoughts on open source were wrong and I realize that it's just a little badness from the overall goodness. Just like Yin Yang. Layer5 has been a supportive community that not only develops your technical side, it nurtures your thinking and reasoning.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/rudraksh-pareek\">\n    Rudraksh Pareek\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Rudraksh } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"rudraksh-pareek\"/>\n  <br/>\n  My journey with open source started when I got into college and fell into the company of some geeky open source evangelists. They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software.\nHowever, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn't do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community. Whenever I was assigned something, I tried to get my teeth into it as deep as I could before reaching out for help. This helped me learn a lot in a healthy way.\n      There was so much happening around and I wanted to be a part of it all. So I started attending all the meetings and was able to put my finger into many pies. I soon became better at expressing my thoughts and pretty soon, I developed an interest in CI/CD practices. Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming.\nI learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications. However, this short span often leads to unjust outcomes.\n      Thus, I believe paying back for what you give to the project is a philosophy in the best faith of everyone in the long term. I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to.\nDuring the course of my internship, I'll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Layer5 Cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in \"on premise environments\". I'll also be collaborating with Ashish Tiwari on integrating a workflow engine with Meshery introducing best practices to be followed by management software.\nLooking forward to learning and growing during this time while continuing to try my best to help others in the community.\nThank you.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/nithish-karthik\"> Nithish Karthik </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Nithish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"nithish-karthik\"/>\n  <br />\n     I knew exactly what I wanted to do ever since my childhood, I wanted to become a programmer. Technology related stuff always intrigued me. But I had to prepare for an entrance examination IITJEE which required enormous dedication and focus to succeed. And so, I had to put my coding dreams on hold till I joined college.\nBut after I joined college, I felt a sense of freedom within me, in the sense that I could now pursue my passion wholeheartedly. So, the next question was, \"Where do I start ?\".\nThere were a lot of buzz words going around in my college among my peers like CP, Dev, AI and ML etc. I also noticed that people were forcing themselves to do them even when they had no sense of passion or appreciation towards the field. But for me, I always had more joy in the process of doing something than the outcome I get from it. So, I started exploring various fields to find what I loved the most. And I found that I wanted to do development.\n  So, I started working on myself. After I got the fundamentals clear, I wanted to have some practical experience to have an idea of how production grade products are being made. So, I worked on a couple of startups to get an exposure to real world development. And I learned a lot during that period. But then, I felt I needed to switch my gear. The idea of open source has always intrigued me the most but my efforts towards open source contribution has not been a success because,\n\n1. I always got intimidated by the size of codebase\n2. I didn't have people guiding me\n\nSome of my seniors, who had the best interest in me, encouraged me to get into open source, but I did not take it seriously because I felt intimidated by the idea. I instead thought I would look for some open source internships that way I would have someone mentoring me and that would help me in starting my open source journey. I went through many programs but most of them were closed at that time, except, Meshery in LFX. I thought, this is the only choice I have, let's do it, I had nothing to lose. I applied for that program and as a prerequisite, I had to engage with the community. I looked at the community calendar and I saw that there was a newcomer's call that day and I attended it. I have never had such a warm welcome in any other communities.\nOn that day, I knew that this community is special and I should spend more time with it. I explored the projects and as usual, I felt intimidated, but this time, I had people, wonderful people to help me. I landed my first open source PR, which was a single line style change. But the encouragement and support I got from the community for that was so wonderful . I realised that this community is not just about building best quality products but also about building best quality human beings. It has been a roller coaster ride with Layer5 since then. I got so involved with the process that I had stopped caring about getting that internship.\n   The community has really wonderful people who taught me not only about coding, but also about \"How to be\". I am really grateful that I found this community and I hope that everyone has a chance to experience this. \nI started engaging more in the community projects, especially Meshery UI and always kept coming up with ways to improve it.\n    And fast forward to September 2021, I was told to enroll for the LFX fall term mentorship program and here I am. But, this has never been the goal for me, there is more to me and Layer5 than this internship. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can.\n    Thank you\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/ashish-tiwari\"> Ashish Tiwari </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Ashish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"ashish-tiwari\"/>\n  <br />\n  I started my programming career in 2020 when my classmates were bagging internships.I started late because the first two years of my college I never thought that I was a \"programming guy\" as I always was more of a Physics/Mathematics guy. But in 2020, when the pandemic hit I started programming from \"hello world\". I thought I was too late to the party and often felt overwhelmed. After 1 year of getting a taste of everything from data structures, web development, databases and everything in between that a CS undergraduate comes across; I thought to call myself a Backend dev. But I still was dissatisfied and finding something interesting when I came across the concept of containerization which looked magic to me. From there it was a roller coaster ride to kubernetes and then understanding service meshes. I immediately was drawn into the entire CNCF ecosystem.\n  After procrastinating for a while, I learnt golang one night, made a side project to feel confident in it and dove back into watching CNCF talks explaining some exciting technology in Golang code.During all this my friend and also my current mentor, Utkarsh helped me through and through. He explained to me what Meshery is and I was immediately drawn in because Meshery is a good vantage point to the entire CNCF ecosystem. Believe me, while working on meshery at one point or another you will run into almost all major projects under CNCF. \nLike for any other beginner, it was all too overwhelming but exciting at the same time. Man it's such a rush when you realize that you don't know so much stuff because then there is an open window for absorbing all that stuff. I started going through docs, blogs and CNCF talks(shit that rhymed). I still binge CNCF talks. There is a plethora of good talks for you, if you are a beginner. I always prefer those over any \"youtube tutorials\". Anyways, back to my journey.\n  So two months ago, I found an open issue in mesheryctl. I solved the issue/enhancement, showed the code in a community meeting and got the PR merged. This was my first ever open source contribution. From there it just took off. I wrote a new command in mesheryctl then wrote unit tests. All this while trying to get an opportunity to write code for any core component like meshery server or adapters. Then one day I accidentally got into a WASM filter meeting(believe me,joined accidentally), got asked to add one feature and I said - \"yes\". And this is how it starts for most people. You get out of your comfort zone and say \"yes\", start learning new stuff, make mistakes, get corrected and the cycle continues. Fast forward two months, I was offered an internship.From what I have learnt as a person who started late is that you only need two things- \"Curiosity\" to ask questions out of your comfort zone and \"Resilience\" to absorb answers when they are thrown at you. Layer5 is an amazing community.\n  I guarantee you will not find such a warm and welcoming community so easily. If you come here for internships, you won't be here for long (or anywhere else to be honest). When your goals are solely to gain knowledge, experience while contributing to a niche, new and exciting tech- the opportunities will be waiting for you. I still have a long way to go and so much to learn. My journey with this project is certainly going to be longer than the span of this internship.\n  \\- Nithish, Ashish, Rudraksh and Bariq\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Fall Interns of 2021","date":"Sep 1st, 2021","author":"Interns of Fall 2021","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/ba84b/fall-interns.webp 750w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/3780a/fall-interns.webp 1080w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/bed15/fall-interns.webp 1366w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.39479166666666665}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/ba84b/fall-interns.webp 750w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/3780a/fall-interns.webp 1080w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/bed15/fall-interns.webp 1366w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.39479166666666665}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/meet-the-fall-interns-of-2021"}},{"id":"41e991fb-eaeb-55d4-be96-3a0e20e3329f","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\nimport gsocLogo from \"./gsoc.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<img src={gsocLogo} className=\"gsoc-image\" align=\"right\" alt=\"gsoc-image\" />\n  Hi, I am Piyush Singariya, a short description of me would be “another\n  software engineer watching anime”, in the longer version I am a 2021 graduate\n  from IIT Roorkee, who loves to watch anime and play video games all day.

It was indeed a pleasant and impactful experience for both the mentors and the mentees from She Code Africa.\n    The <a href=\"https://www.shecodeafrica.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa</a> hosts their Contributhon as an Africa-wide open source boot camp focused on building more women OSS contributors & creating more diversity in the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsors and mentors from Open Source organizations. During this boot camp, participants work with an open source organisation on a project for 4 weeks with the help of organisation mentors and get rewarded at the end of the boot camp upon successful project completion.\n  During the boot camp, Layer5 received a total of 8 mentees - all from Nigeria. These mentees were teamed up to work on the 3 project ideas selected by Layer5. Each project had an average of 2 members of the community who were delegated as mentors to oversee the contributions of the mentees. Often <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">Layer5 MeshMates</Link> volunteer to be mentors.\n\n  <h2>Projects</h2>\n  Layer5 mentors prepared and organized a few projects in advance of the start of the boot camp, so that mentees might hit the ground running.\n  <h3>Layer5 Community Handbook</h3>\n  \n      Layer5 Community Handbook is a curated Document with the ABC's of the community. In this project, mentees were expected to look for repetition pattern across existing docs thereby, creating a structured guide for interaction across all projects.\n  <b>Mentors:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\">Ruth Ikegah</Link></li>\n    <li><Link  to=\"/community/members/anita-ihuman\">Anita Ihuman</Link></li>\n  </ul>\n  <b>Mentee(s):</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnisatAkinbani\">Anisat Akinbani</a></li>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/abiola-farounbi\">Abiola Farounbi</Link></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  \n  <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n  <img\n    src={ Sandy }\n    alt=\"sandy-testimonial\"\n  />\n  <img\n    src={ Abiola }\n    alt=\"abiola-testimonial\"\n  />\n  </div>\n  <h3>Layer5 Main Website</h3>\n  \n      This required the contributors to fix existing issues on the GitHub repository, while suggesting ideas to improve the website, which used Gatsbyjs and Reactjs. The layer5.io website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is a collaborative effort of nearly 200 contributors.\n  <b>Mentors:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/jash-patel\">Jash Patel</Link></li>\n    <li><Link  to=\"/community/members/chinmay-mehta\">Chinmay Mehta</Link></li>\n  </ul>\n  <b>Mentee(s):</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/elizabeth-lola\">Elizabeth Meshioye</Link></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/adun__ni\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cynthia Akinade</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/blossom_babs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blossom Babalola</a></li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n  <img\n    src={ Cynthia }\n    alt=\"cynthia-testimonial\"\n  />\n  <img\n    src={ Elizabeth }\n    alt=\"elizabeth-testimonial\"\n  />\n  </div>\n  <h3>Meshery CLI</h3>\n      <code>mesheryctl</code> is a command-line tool for Meshery, the cloud native management plane. Using Golang, mentees were required to design new CLI commands and attend to existing issues, focusing on enforcing the consistency of user experience with the command line client.\n  <b>Mentors:</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Navendu Pottekkat</li>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/chinmay-mehta\">Chinmay Mehta</Link></li>\n  </ul>\n  <b>Mentee(s):</b>\n  <ul>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/joy-nwaiwu\">Joy Nwaiwu</Link></li>\n    <li><Link to=\"/community/members/naimat-oyewale\">Naimat Oyewale</Link></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n  <img\n    src={ Naimat }\n    alt=\"naimat-testimonial\"\n  />\n  <img\n    src={ Joy }\n    alt=\"joy-testimonial\"\n  />\n  </div>\n    The mentors were in constant communication with the mentees, taking their questions and rendering help when needed. At the end of the Contribution boot camp, it was heartwarming to see the mentees were able to make noticeable contributions to the projects.  During the boot camp wrap up call, mentees gave presentations that revealed how impactful it was for them working on Layer5 projects.\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\n    In gratitude, we acknowledge the commitment and contributions of the mentees toward the projects and we won't forget our incredible mentors who were devoted to meeting the needs and answering to the mentees during this bootcamp.

It was in the middle of the pandemic, though, with my mind trying to find an escape, that I stumbled upon Layer5. Within the first week of joining the Layer5 community, I had a pull request posted, and much to my surprise, found myself demo'ing it in the very next community meeting. In retrospect, it was a minor pull request, making some UI changes for Meshery. The encouragement I received was so welcoming and supportive. After that first week's experience, and so much technology and projects to explore, I was hooked - there was no turning back for me from that point.\n      I started learning more about the projects in Layer5 and its tech stack. From how Meshery Server was using gRPC and protobufs to communicate with each of its service mesh adaptors to defining how <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI Conformance</Link> works and the <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"https://layer5.io/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link> specification to how Meshery UI leverages some awesome libraries like NextJS, BillboardJS, and Redux. It has been through contributing to  each of these areas, that I have learned each of these technologies more deeply and it was all possible because of the continuous influx of awesome support from the community, especially <Link to=\"/community/members/abishek-kumar\">Abishek Kumar</Link> <i>and I probably won't stop poking him for support anytime soon</i>.\n      As I look forward to a structured internship with Layer5 through Google Summer of Code this summer, I do so knowing I will be collaborating with the large Layer5 community, engineers from other technology companies and spending a lot of time with Soham and Piyush. For my part, I'll be working on a visual topology to help service mesh operators map their deployments, model their application performance, and parse their service proxy logs. I am ready to make an impact, learn more, and help other community members ( and watch as they, too, are initiated into the Layer5 community through ritual of giving an awkward first-timer introduction in our Community Meeting 😛).\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/piyush-singariya\">\n    Piyush Singariya\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Piyush } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"piyush-singariya\" />\n      It all started with an idea, the idea of doing open source contributions. And with that after scrolling through many open source communities, I found Layer5, jumped up into our Slack workspace, started learning about Meshery. I raised a PR and was immediately made to feel like a rockstar. I began  meeting more of the community members, learning more about Meshery and its command line client, `mesheryctl` with each contribution. And you know, its extrenely gratifying to have your pull request merged, and that feeling is amplified by the feedback and attention you receive as a contributor at Layer5.\n      I knew that I wanted to engage even more deeply and learn all that I can from the seasoned engineers at Layer5. And so, I applied for internship. Layer5 takes internships seriously and doesn't accept anyone into internship until you have proven your commitment to their awesome projects.\n    And at the time of writing this, it’s been almost three months of contributing bfore being accepted as GSoC student. I have spent most of my time focusing on Layer5’s Meshery project and it’s command line client, `mesheryctl`.\n      And so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2021 program, which began on the night of May 17th, 2021 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). I am hyped up and excited to go ahead with Layer5 for the upcoming months.\n      My GSoC project is about introducing interesting and important features to Meshery Server and `mesheryctl`. Such as automating Documentation and Interactive playground for Meshery Server’s REST API endpoints, adding commands related to performance testing and enhancing Meshery’s environment health checking, introducing unit testing for `mesheryctl`, and CI/CD and documentation for all the new features.\n      It has been 2 weeks since I have started my GSoC’21 tenure with the Layer5 community, and from the very beginning (I mean before GSoC), I have learned a lot with my code contributions and the Community here. I began with setting up the performance command under mesheryctl and Open API Specification 2.0 for REST API documentation to the project. I am learning a lot of new things, like Unit Testing, Open API Specification, and much more to include.\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/soham-sonawane\"> Soham Sonawane </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Soham } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"soham-sonaware\" />\n      I got to know about Layer5 last year in December when one of my batchmates told me that he was contributing to the community. He asked me if I wanted to join Slack and wanted to contribute to a project. So I looked at the projects on Github and some open issues that I could contribute to. Me being a frontend developer I saw an issue related to removing whitespaces and minor frontend changes. I just made a PR and it was merged then I joined the Slack workspace and attended the <Link to=\"/community/newcomers\">Newcomers</Link> meeting. I was introduced to a lot of things that I could work on. All of them felt amazing and interesting, all I had to do was “signal” and I could work on any one of them.\n    At first I thought that I should just work on layer5.io or maybe NightHawk, but then I was given an opportunity to work on something that I had never done before. It has been around 4 months that I have been a part of the community and I am actively trying to add to the project attending weekly meetings where everyone shares amazing stuff about what they did.\n      As I said earlier my project is something that I had never worked on before, very interesting to work on, it adds one of the most important and unique features to Meshery. Meshery's MeshMap enables users to visualize their service meshes, look at important statistics. It also enables users to design their own service meshes by either importing their designs from a yaml file or by dragging and dropping service mesh components into a\n    canvas, creating edges, grouping components, persisting these designs to see or edit later, realizing these designs by actually deploying them as service meshes and a lot more.\n    My job is to be the God of CytoscapeJS, who knows every nook and cranny of the library that enables us to create the visual topology. It's been a week since I have started my LFX internship and I have been working on visual topology even before that. These months of contributing code have taught me a lot. The first task that was given to me was to explore the\n    CytoscapeJS library and demonstrate a proof of concept of animated edges between 2 components. I sat for 3 hours straight right after the community meeting creating the demo and posted a video on our slack. I was never\n    appreciated better than on that day. I have never looked back since, each time I am given a feature or issue or any request I try my hardest to realize it in the earliest. I am constantly trying to improve myself and add to the project.\n  \\- Dhruv, Piyush, and Soham\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Summer Interns of 2021","date":"Jun 4th,

Extension points allow custom resolvers and schema additions.\n\n---\n\n## Meshery CLI Enhancements\n\nThe beloved `mesheryctl` introduces:\n\n- `context` — manage multiple Meshery deployments  \n- `channel` — subscribe deployments to stable or edge release channels  \n\n### Managing Multiple Deployments\n\nMeshery now uses a `meshconfig` file describing multiple contexts across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. Use:\n\n- `mesheryctl system context`\n\n\nto switch deployments instantly.\n\n### Subscribing to Release Channels\n\n`mesheryctl system channel` lets you choose the release channel for each deployment, enable or disable auto-updates, or pin versions manually.\n\nReview all commands at the  \n<a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl\">mesheryctl Command Reference</a>.\n\n---\n\n## On to v0.6.0\n\nReview the full list of enhancements in the  \n[Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/).\n\nPlanning for v0.6.0 is complete, and the community's innovation cycle shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nSee the  \n<a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/blob/master/ROADMAP.md\">Meshery roadmap</a>.\n\n---\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n  If these topics excite you, come say “Hi” in the community\n  <a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\"> Slack</a> — you’ll be warmly welcomed. 😀\n</div>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Meshery v0.5.0","date":"Apr 19th, 2021","author":"Aisuko Li","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/v0.5.0.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlAAAABXRUJQVlA4IEQAAAAwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwC7AB6PNYoAAP7ZPPBqgHk9L8Rq4LOZeWzq4QQEHi3NCBc96JkEWIAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/1ff2c/v0.5.0.webp","srcSet":"/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/ee7ce/v0.5.0.webp 750w,\n/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/819dc/v0.5.0.webp 1080w,\n/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/7b8ce/v0.5.0.webp 1366w,\n/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/1ff2c/v0.5.0.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/v0.5.0.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlAAAABXRUJQVlA4IEQAAAAwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwC7AB6PNYoAAP7ZPPBqgHk9L8Rq4LOZeWzq4QQEHi3NCBc96JkEWIAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/1ff2c/v0.5.0.webp","srcSet":"/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/ee7ce/v0.5.0.webp 750w,\n/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/819dc/v0.5.0.webp 1080w,\n/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/7b8ce/v0.5.0.webp 1366w,\n/static/8817162db307ec6582ad1a1f5aa71201/1ff2c/v0.5.0.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-meshery-v050"}},{"id":"00a26b73-8364-5c1f-a68d-60f8cc7c16d8","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport img from \"./jash-patel-layer5-maintainer.webp\";\nimport { MeetTheMaintainer } from \"../../MeetTheMaintainer.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n  <MeetTheMaintainer>\n\n<div className=\"intro \">\n\n      Next on Layer5 Meet the Maintainer’s series, we have Jash Patel.

Many people inside and outside of the\n    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions but may not\n    know the backstory as to who Jash is and how you arrived at your maintainer\n    role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made\n    you stay?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      Back in August 2020, I was looking for an open-source organization. I found\n    my friend\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/tanuj-agarwal\"> Tanuj </Link> was part of Layer5,\n    and I thought of joining it. I jumped onto my first community call, and Whoo!\n    It was so smooth. I was delighted to see the overwhelming response of the community.\n    I loved the way the community encouraged every newcomer to their first contribution.\n    After that, I never looked back. I still remember my first community meeting\n    in which I introduced myself, highlighting my interests in React. The response\n    was <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\"> Lee </Link> giving an overly positive reaction.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n      I can totally relate to how amazing the Layer5 onboarding process is unique!\n    Layer5 Projects has many active, open-source projects. You’ve been\n    consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently\n    focusing on? Psst. Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      I started contributing to docs and soon dived into Layer5 websites. While I\n    have worked on almost all websites, t (a little in some). The next\n    generation Layer5 website (built on Gatsby) was the site I worked on the\n    longest. We recently launched this new site (it takes a lot to launch a\n    website). Currently, I am working on enhancements to the website and on\n    Layer5’s upcoming discussion forum. I think, after this, you would already\n    know my favorite one.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n      Definitely, winks! Have you worked with any other open source project? How\n    does Layer5 compare?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      I am a part of my college’s open-source organization. I have contributed to\n    and also have mentored a few open-source projects there. Open source is\n    always fun - it doesn't matter where you do it. The difference I found here\n    was the vast and diverse community that was missing there. Also, exposure to\n    different technologies was advantageous for me.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n      You know for me, coming to The Next Generation Layer5 Website was done in\n    the space of 6 months which is really impressive. How was the team able to\n    pull that off?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n      It was a pretty big task. Many people have worked on it(At the time of\n    launch we had 140 contributors). It started with Tanuj and me, and then got\n    many hands to help us and strive towards its completion. I can’t write all\n    those names, or else it would take an entire page to note them down. And\n    this is what communities are meant for; open source is intended for. It was\n    a combined effort, and we worked on almost everything. The team worked on\n    Gatsby, GraphQL, SEO, Analytics, and anything related to the website. The\n    two mentors <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\"> Lee </Link> and\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\"> Nikhil </Link>,\n    were quite helpful for the team to bring it through 6 months.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      It’s amazing you are in school and still actively contribute to Layer5, how\n    are you able to multitask it?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n      I once mentioned that while my exams were going on, I would study the entire\n    day, and when I took breaks, I would just open up Github and work on some\n    minor issues. If you are interested in it, you will find a way, I would say.\n    This is what helped me. One of the advantages of being in such a diverse\n    environment is that when you are stuck somewhere, the work doesn't stop,\n    some other contributor picks it up, and it goes on.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      I’m really curious, what does being a Layer5 maintainer mean to you? How has\n    being a maintainer impacted you?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n      I still remember my first pull request being reviewed. And now I am on the\n    other side, reviewing requests. Being a maintainer was a rollercoaster of an\n    experience to me. You don’t just review PRs and point out changes, but you\n    also have to think of fixes for them. The evolution of green to purple is\n    the joy every open-source contributor wishes to see. And me being the one\n    doing it makes me feel good. Being a maintainer adds responsibility on the\n    one hand and gives freedom on the other hand.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      I really picked a lot of points on that! Do you have any advice for\n    individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n      My advice would be to not look for becoming something. I never thought of\n    becoming a maintainer. You just enjoy whatever you are doing, and when the\n    time comes, you will get it. Being a maintainer is always special, but\n    what's more critical is contributing healthily. A maintainer was always a\n    contributor first, and it is that experience that sails them through. I have\n    already recommended many of my friends and would like to share it with you;\n    if you want to learn open source, Layer5 is the place. We, as a community,\n    are always excited to have more people on board and learning something new\n    from here. I would love to share the stage with you shortly.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      That was some great advice there and tips! Thanks, Jash for all you do for\n    the community. It’s lovely having you as a maintainer.\n\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n      That was some great advice there and tips!

MeshKit can be considered a derivative of `go-kit` with specific focus on cloud native management.\n\nIn the Meshery v0.5.0 release, MeshKit has been enhanced and expanded substantially. Considering that the MeshKit library provides broadly useful functionality, it is used in a growing number of Meshery components. It is intended to be one of the top level libraries in the Meshery ecosystem. <div className=\"fact\">Meshkit provides functionality useful across all Meshery components.</div>\n\nMeshKit is a toolkit for Layer5’s microservices, and is positioned to become Layer5’s middleware component for Layer5’s microservices, leveraging other libraries like `go-kit/kit`. In complement to functionality provided by any given cloud native infrastructure component, its purpose is to provide implementations for common cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and tracing. Uniform error handling and logging across all Meshery components helps to implement efficient tooling for observability, monitoring and troubleshooting. The library provides some common data models for Meshery and Meshery's <a href=\"https://meshery.io/extensions\">ecosystem of extensions</a>.\n\nAnother central component in Meshkit is the `utils` package.\n\nThis package provides a Kubernetes and a Helm client that implements functionality based on the Go libraries of these tools. The API exposed by these libraries is quite low-level, and the higher-level functions of the `utils` package simplifies usage of Kubernetes and Helm clients significantly.\nAnother advantage MeshKit that it is not necessary to use the command line versions of these tools, providing a more tailored experience for developers,\nand better logging and error handling integration.\n\n<Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshkit\">MeshKit</Link> is simple and straight\nforward to use, as the following code example illustrates.{\" \"}\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\n\tmeshkitlogger \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/logger\"\n\tmeshkitkubernetes \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/utils/kubernetes\"\n\t\"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// nginx contains the deployment manifest for nginx.\n\tnginx := `apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n`\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit logger handler.\n\tlog, err := meshkitlogger.New(\"ExampleApp\",\n\t\tmeshkitlogger.Options{Format: meshkitlogger.JsonLogFormat, DebugLevel: false})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully instantiated meshkit logger\")\n\n\t// Detect kubeconfig on the local system.\n\tconfig, err := meshkitkubernetes.DetectKubeConfig()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(config.Host)\n\n\t// Create Kubernetes client set for the detected kubeconfig using the Kubernetes Go client library.\n\tclientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit Kubernetes client ...\n\tclient, err := meshkitkubernetes.New(clientset, *config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// ... and use it to deploy nginx to the cluster.\n\terr2 := client.ApplyManifest([]byte(nginx), meshkitkubernetes.ApplyOptions{\n\t\tNamespace: \"default\",\n\t\tUpdate:    true,\n\t\tDelete:    false,\n\t})\n\tif err2 != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err2)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully applied the manifest\")\n}\n```\n\n## Meshery Adapters\n\nMeshery adapters are management plane components and manage the lifecycle of cloud native infra. This includes installation and deletion, configuration, and verification that an installation follows recommended practices. As example use of Meshery adapters is for purposes of compliance verification, actively attesting whether whether infrastructure complies to an open standard, like that of <Link to=\"/blog/announcements/a-standard-interface-for-service-meshes\">Service Mesh Interface</Link>. Meshery adapters support management of multiple versions of their respective capabilites and also come bundled with sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of infrastructure (or other) capabilities. <div className=\"fact\">Meshery adapters extend Meshery's core functionality housed within Meshery Server, often deepening Meshery's ability to manage the lifecycle infratructure, but not limited to those use cases. Adapters have been known to act as engineering workflow facilititors, providing gate reviews, sending emails, and so on.</div>\n\nA Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes the `MeshServiceServer` interface:\n\n```go\n// MeshServiceServer is the server API for MeshService service.\ntype MeshServiceServer interface {\n\tCreateMeshInstance(context.Context, *CreateMeshInstanceRequest) (*CreateMeshInstanceResponse, error)\n\tMeshName(context.Context, *MeshNameRequest) (*MeshNameResponse, error)\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, *ApplyRuleRequest) (*ApplyRuleResponse, error)\n\tSupportedOperations(context.Context, *SupportedOperationsRequest) (*SupportedOperationsResponse, error)\n\tStreamEvents(*EventsRequest, MeshService_StreamEventsServer) error\n}\n```\n\n- `CreateInstance` sets up the Kubernetes client. It does not, as the name might imply, create an instance of an infrastructure component.\n- `Name` returns the name of the infrastructure component, configured in the adapter.\n- `SupportedOperations` returns all supported operations, configured in the adapter. An operation is e.g. the installation of any given cloud native infrastructure component or service.\n- `ApplyOperation` executes the operation specified in the request. It is one of the supported operations.\n- `StreamEvents` allows sending events from the server to the client.\n\nThis API is one of the extension points of Meshery, making it easy to add support for new cloud native technologies to Meshery. Meshery adapters abstract away differences in installation and configuration of the various technologies. Various cloud native technologies are installed and configured in their own way. For instance, some projects have their own installer, like `istioctl` for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. One of the purposes of Meshery adapters is to abstract these differences away. <div className=\"fact\">It's important to note, however, that Meshery Adapters allow Meshery to interface with each managed system uniquely, and not treat those systems uniformly by only offering the lowest common denominator of functionality, but instead by exposing that system's differentiated value to users.</div>\n\n\n\n## Meshery Adapter Library\n\nAs can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. Initially, this common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several libraries. After some discussion, the community decided to move some of the more general code to Meshkit, and adapter specific code to a new library.\n\nThus, the Meshery Adapter Library was born.\n\nIt reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the adapters substantially, making adapter code easier to follow. This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time. For the same reasons, it is important such libraries are easily understandable.\n\nAlso, it means new adapters can be implemented quickly, as only configuration and operations that differ between services meshes need to be implemented.\n\n<div className=\"fact\">\n  The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of\n  functionality that Meshery adapters use for managing the lifecycle of\n  cloud infrastructure and their workloads.\n</div>\n\nThe initial commit was submitted on October 6th, 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the Kuma service mesh. Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nThe main purpose of the Meshery Adapter Library is to:\n\n- provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.\n- implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.\n- provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n\nThe core interface in the library is the adapter `Handler` interface:\n\n```go\n// Interface Handler is extended by adapters, and used in package api/grpc that implements the MeshServiceServer.\ntype Handler interface {\n\t// GetName returns the name of the adapter.\n\tGetName() string\n\t// CreateInstance instantiates clients used in deploying and managing mesh instances, e.g. Kubernetes clients.\n\tCreateInstance([]byte, string, *chan interface{}) error\n\t// ApplyOperation applies an adapter operation. This is adapter specific and needs to be implemented by each adapter.\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, OperationRequest) error\n\t// ListOperations list all operations an adapter supports.\n\tListOperations() (Operations, error)\n\n\t// Need not implement this method and can be reused\n\tStreamErr(*Event, error) // Streams an error event, e.g. to a channel\n\tStreamInfo(*Event)       // Streams an informational event, e.g. to a channel\n}\n```\n\nIt corresponds closely to the gRPC API discussed above, and indeed these methods are called in the implementation of the `MeshServiceServer` interface. This implementation is also part of the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nUsing `struct` embedding, an adapter extends the default implementation `Adapter` of the interface `Handler` from the library.\nUsually, it is sufficient that this adapter handler overrides only the `ApplyOperation` function from the default implementation.\n(There, it is a no-op implementation.)\n\nThe figure below illustrates this and the usage of the library in an adapter.\n\n<img\n  src={mesheryAdapterLibrary}\n  className=\"image-center\"\n  alt=\"meshery adapter library\"\n/>\n\nIn the `main` package of the adapter, the default configuration provider `Viper` from the library is instantiated, and reads the adapter specific configuration. This includes a specification of all available operations. As configuration providers are implementations of an interface, you can choose any of the providers from the library, or implement your own.\n\nNext, an instance of the adapter handler is created. Other components, for instance a logger, may be created depending on needs and requirements, which is symbolize by the three dots in the figure.\n\nThe `service` is a struct that holds all the parameters that specify an adapter service, like the port the gRPC server is running on, and the instance of the adapter handler created in a previous step. This struct is passed to the `Start` function from the library. This `Start` function wraps the gRPC server, wiring up all necessary components, and starts the service. The developer does not need to touch any gRPC code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nExtracting common code from adapters to the two new libraries has proven to be a worthwhile investment. It led to cleaner code as well as cleaner application architecture, shortened implementation time for new adapters considerably, and upleveled the quality of Meshery's adapters through consistency of implementation.\n\n\n<div className=\"intro\">P.S.

If I remember correctly, I was looking for a professional focus area earlier this year, and landed on service meshes. I had worked with service meshes before, which piqued my initial interest. I had worked with Istio as part of my work for some time, and in the same context I stumbled across Meshery. I wasn’t able to dig deep in Meshery back then, but the concept sounded fascinating to me. Additionally, I had been benefiting from open source, both personally and professionally for a long time, but apart from a few minor contributions, I had never been able to give back to the community. I hoped to correct that.\n\n      I re-discovered Meshery and the Layer5 community, listened to a recording of a community meeting, and read a couple of blog posts describing the community and member experience posts. One that stood out for me was a post by <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\">MeshMate Nikhil Ladha</Link>. Going by his words, it appeared to be a warm, diverse and active community. My suspicions were confirmed when I joined. Layer5 offers a wholesome, interactive community in addition to unbiasedly providing help and guidance around the virtual corner.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?<br />\n      <i>Psst.</i> Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I’m a technical architect and programmer, which made the backend, especially the adapters, a natural choice for me. It involves both contributing to the management plane, but also looking at and using service meshes from an architectural point of view. The possible implementations of service meshes is an area that has been particularly fascinating for me.\n\n      I’d probably continue to work with the Meshery adapters for now before moving on to other areas of the project. Haha, I would probably name the Meshery Adapter Library as my favorite Layer5 project till date.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I have worked and collaborated with several open source communities before, including Eclipse Modelling Framework and Apache ServiceMix. I couldn’t possibly make a very accurate comparison, given my limited interaction with other communities, but the Layer5 community stands out based on the unique and extremely inclusive approach it takes towards upholding community values.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      What is so fascinating about service meshes?\n    </div>\n\n    <img className=\"right\" src={MoireCircles} alt=\"Moiré circle pattern\" />\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I find meshes intriguing in general. Meshes can look intricate, layered and complicated at a first glance, and yet they are built on the most basic principles. For me, meshes are visual structures, complete with an aesthetic and artistic dimension.\n\n      Fun Fact: Overlapping meshes resulting in Moiré patterns are an example of this. They appealed to me from a young age, and I learned about their mathematics from my mathematics teacher.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically though?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      An increasing number of applications nowadays consist of distributed services, both in the cloud and on-premises, in mixed and hybrid environments. Many legacy applications are in express need of modernisation, consuming and being consumed by cloud native applications. Introducing microservices, also by refactoring monolithic applications, increases the complexity of the service landscape. By delegating cross-cutting infrastructure concerns like security, traffic management, resilience, and observability to the service mesh, some of the complexity is moved from the applications to the service mesh, allowing application developers to focus on business logic. A concern in these distributed, dynamic and scalable systems is that the security also needs to scale. If security doesn’t scale, it becomes very challenging to handle such systems. Service meshes today are already able to support many of these scenarios, and are continuously improving.\n\n      Service meshes are complex but that is something I enjoy attempting as a challenge, to have control and overview and make it appear simple, investing into automating options. Another field that I’m excited to learn about continuously is related to the security of distributed systems, and how service meshes contribute to implementing a zero trust network architecture.\n\n      I actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgfeller/status/1289951164281233408\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">dreamed about service mesh</a> a while ago. That was almost a bit spooky.\n    </div>\n\n    <img className=\"right\" src={MoireLines} alt=\"Moiré line pattern\" />\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Haha. Leading on that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      Meshery currently does a great job of providing a neutral platform. Continuing in that direction would be a superb base plan. Enabling innovative applications from vendors, supporting all service meshes, integrating best practice methods, and implementing the SMP and SMI abstractions would probably score the top five positions in Meshery’s new year resolutions in 2021.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Interesting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      At the moment, Meshery provides a management plane solution and provides support for the SMI and <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Service Mesh Performance</a> (SMP) specifications. Helpful additions in the future should be the configuration based best practices, especially with regards to security and to possibly extend to owning up specific routes on security. For instance by verifying that the recommendations outlined in the NIST report “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture” by Ramaswamy Chandramouli and Zack Butcher.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      What are today's challenges when working with service meshes?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I can’t claim to have worked with many implementations, and to have a good overview and wide experience. A lot of the complexity is already handled, but there is still enough to decide and implement for each solution. The solution makes for a challenging but highly interesting task. Additionally, there are a variety of different solutions from different vendors, which is excellent but it also makes it hard to know which would be the best fit for a given situation. Here, again, Meshery can be of invaluable help.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      The service mesh promise holds a lot of potential, for instance for modernization and ease of use. A lot appears to be happening these times. It will be interesting to see how serverless solutions will be integrated. Enabling a seamless implementation experience for solutions embracing multi-cloud, on-prem and legacy systems is also something to look forward to. Additionally, service meshes are aimed at making your architecture more secure and stable, which makes security a big concern for any service mesh provider. Improvements along these points will be topics I’ll be watching out for over the next few years.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Ah while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up. Cloud Native and especially, the field of service meshes evolving exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      Service mesh implementations consist of many components, and I try to stay up to date in general. Try to follow as much as possible conferences and vendor announcements, blog posts etc. mainly by following related Twitter accounts. Also, trying to find some time to explore various solutions. Lee’s books are of course an excellent source. Another book I can recommend is *Zero Trust Networks* by Gilman and Barth. It really helped me to understand how service meshes relate to zero trust network architecture and can help to move towards it.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      I take my role as a Meshery maintainer with its benefits and responsibilities. For one, it means to be able to give back to the community. I meet a lot of interesting and friendly people from around the globe, learning about their culture at the same time. Additionally, Open Source allows me to work on and dive into tasks as I like, making it easy to integrate the work with my existing work schedule. It also allows me to learn a lot, expanding on my understanding of service meshes, keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and also giving me the opportunity to witness first-hand how others are using them. This has a quite direct impact on my full-time role, complementing the work I do.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Shriti:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Michael:</span>\n      A general love for software development combined with a readiness to help out newcomers and participating in the growing community is the key.\n\n      Come and visit, there is something for everyone, be it frontend, backend, CI/CD, website, documentation, standards, interfacing with other communities, and more. The friendly community members and the meshmates will provide support and guidance. Browse the Layer5 and Meshery websites and the repositories on GitHub, where issues suitable for newcomers are especially tagged.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"note\">\n      <img src={ForkLift} height=\"100\" width=\"100\" alt=\"Forklift illustration\" />\n      In his relatively short tenure at Layer5, Michael has already delivered a wave of meshy contributions enhancing the Meshery adapters and improving upon Meshery’s architecture. With a penchant for looking behind the curtain and tightening loose cogs until they run to perfection, Michael's impactful and consistent contributions have him taking his place as Meshery maintainer. The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like Michael.\n    </div>\n\n    \"Be like Mike\".

As a reliably test tool, Cypress  works with <i>ReactJS</i>, <i>VueJS</i>, <i>AngularJS</i> and so on; it is agnostic of the framework you use. You can write all types of tests: <i>end-to-end</i>, <i>integration</i>, and <i>unit tests</i>.\n\nTests allow you to ensure that the new code do not break the current one. They help you to develop and integrate new features faster and ensure everything will work after including your changes. The more tests you have, the more coverage you will have (and less likelihood of issues in production).\n\n### UI tests in Meshery\n\nMeshery has two web projects:\n\n- <b>provider-ui:</b> A <i>ReactJS</i> app that allows you to select the Provider to be used for Meshery\n- <b>ui:</b> Also a <i>ReactJS</i> app where you can do everything related with Meshery. It is the cloud native management plane.\n\nWe create UI tests for both projects using Cypress. Also, we write two types of UI tests at the moment:\n- <b>Integration:</b> Test a specific functionality without backend communication (mocking requests and responses)\n- <b>End-to-end:</b> Test a whole flow like setting up Linkerd Service Mesh or running a SMI Performance Test sending requests and validating the responses from the back-end\n\n### How to write UI tests for Meshery\n\nIf you are writting your first test, you can read and watch the <b><u><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html\">great getting started</a></u></b> from Cypress blog.\n\nThen, you have to add your test below `\"provider-ui/cypress/integration\"` or `\"ui/cypress/integration\"` folders (do not forget adding <i>_spec</i> in the filename).\n\nHere is a basic example of a test validating that <b>Provider UI component</b> exists:\n\n```javascript\ndescribe('Provider UI', () => {\n  it('renders provider component', () => {\n    cy\n      .get('[data-cy=root]')\n      .should('exist')\n  })\n})\n```\n\nPlease follow the <b><u><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html\">best practices recommended</a></u></b> by Cypress.\nOne of the most important is to use or add the `\"data-cy\"` attribute to the element you want to interact to:\n\n<img src={bestPracticesSelectingElementsImg} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"Best Practices selecting elements with Cypress\" />\n<div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>Best Practices Selecting Elements</div>\n### Run your test!\n\nOnce you have written your test, it is time to execute it locally:\n\n1. First, you have to run the back-end executing this command at the root project folder:\n\n```bash\n$ make run-local\n```\n\n2. Then, run the front-end project (i.e. provider-ui)\n\n```bash\n$ make run-provider-ui-dev\n```\n\n3. Finally, in `\"provider-ui\"` folder, run all the tests with:\n\n```bash\n$ npm run cy:run\n```\n\nIf everything went well, you will see <b>\"All specs passed!\"</b> message. Congrats!\n\nYou can also execute, debug and see in real time your test by executing:\n\n```bash\n$ npm run cy:open\n```\n\nthis will open the <b>Cypress Test Runner:</b>\n\n<img src={cypressTestRunnerImg} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"Cypress Test Runner\" />\n<div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>Cypress Test Runner</div>\njust double-click on your test and a window browser will be opened and you will see your testing running!\n\n#### What’s next?\n\nTo improve writting better tests, I recommend that you watch:\n\n- Watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIFSI7xtwFs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshery Development Meeting (Nov 4th, 2020)</a> where I gave a demo running UI tests on the Meshery project (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QbMEyQgbXMLvvSheAIDruzCFe8SmBrKXUjqP0Hxfqjw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">slides</a>)\n- <a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/examples/examples/tutorials.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tutorial Videos</a> from Cypress blog.\n- The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XQOK0v_YRE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brian Mann – I see your point, but… (Part 1)</a> YouTube video where he gives pro tips writting tests in Cypress.\n\nIf you have questions, do not hesitate to ask to the Meshery community on Slack :)\n\nHappy testing!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Functional Testing with Cypress in Meshery UI","date":"Dec 16th, 2020","author":"Rodolfo Martinez Vega","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/cypress-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvwAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABQAAQUxQSHkAAAAAAEuqoDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxEQBQ/v//9CkpLBwlJx4dLxU3AD0VObf/////kbOvpWm3t69rnHwCd4Rvtf////+PtK+lFbxsUslLv2CHg3ZK/f//8TCiIhoBICAgIhkpGxcHMgBDoZcqAhAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZQOCBcAAAAEAMAnQEqFAAGAD7RVKNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCWkAAEmNZx2QAP5J9cl7VPwN7XJEL49/xxssqNFXLSgNmwkZGlgr/sTSa2WP3E3Um5txG6RuWRpO/b5FgZ5pqOnIgAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/35438/cypress-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/2b7d2/cypress-logo.webp 750w,\n/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/ab31e/cypress-logo.webp 1080w,\n/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/53ea9/cypress-logo.webp 1366w,\n/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/35438/cypress-logo.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.2833333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/cypress-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvwAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABQAAQUxQSHkAAAAAAEuqoDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAxEQBQ/v//9CkpLBwlJx4dLxU3AD0VObf/////kbOvpWm3t69rnHwCd4Rvtf////+PtK+lFbxsUslLv2CHg3ZK/f//8TCiIhoBICAgIhkpGxcHMgBDoZcqAhAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFZQOCBcAAAAEAMAnQEqFAAGAD7RVKNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCWkAAEmNZx2QAP5J9cl7VPwN7XJEL49/xxssqNFXLSgNmwkZGlgr/sTSa2WP3E3Um5txG6RuWRpO/b5FgZ5pqOnIgAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/35438/cypress-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/2b7d2/cypress-logo.webp 750w,\n/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/ab31e/cypress-logo.webp 1080w,\n/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/53ea9/cypress-logo.webp 1366w,\n/static/b239a146858aacbc01f39092bd992e6e/35438/cypress-logo.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.2833333333333333}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/functional-testing-with-cypress-in-meshery-ui"}},{"id":"801082fc-64ce-519f-a1a5-438bf5c23540","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport kubecon1 from \"./kubecon1.webp\";\nimport kubecon2 from \"./kubecon2.webp\";\nimport kubecon3 from \"./kubecon3.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p className=\"centered-text\">\n  Thanks to our open source contributors, Layer5 projects are well represented\n  at KubeCon.

Being fairly new\n    to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to\n    delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm\n    welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation\n    jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the\n    task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings\n    hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I\n    finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!\n    It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\n      Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being\n    a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and\n    GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to\n    expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a\n    continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush\n    Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have\n    spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the\n    project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began\n    helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to\n    do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I\n    recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a\n    MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring\n    positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward\n    to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊\n  <br />\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/kelechi-nwachukwu\">\n      Kelechi Precious Nwachukwu\n    </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Kelechi }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"kelechi-precious\"\n  />\n      It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn't\n    something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I\n    stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of\n    projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa\n    (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.\n      A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you\n    some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I\n    recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and\n    managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my\n    hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous\n    tech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too\n    ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow\n    made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another\n    task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a\n    peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the\n    only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was\n    not.\n      I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would\n    previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different\n    approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was\n    amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have\n    helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an\n    invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I\n    have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly\n    environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may\n    not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having\n    a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing\n    determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\"> Ruth Ikegah </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Ruth }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"ruth-ikegah\"\n  />\n      The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a\n    close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.\n    Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only\n    6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came\n    to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel,\n    after which I visited the <Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io\">GitHub repository</Link> and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.\n      To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.\n      Impressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon\n    began helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading. Experience an open-source community with Layer5 today! Once you’re set up on Slack, do send me a ping to\n    say hi. The exciting part, we might even meet as MeshMates 😉\n  \\- Tanuj, Ruth, and Kelechi\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing a new line of MeshMates","date":"Sep 25th, 2020","author":"Our MeshMates with 🤍","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-a-new-line-of-meshmates"}},{"id":"7802e907-ecf2-5e60-93ed-04551ee7687f","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport smpImg from \"./smp.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### What is performance benchmarking and why should you care?\n\nMany of you may remember that the HBO streaming service crashed when the final season of the popular sitcom, Game of Thrones went live on the service. Unable to engage all the user requests, the streaming service and the website broke down and ultimately resulted in DoS (Denial of Service). There are numerous examples of service crashes across different platforms, which has forced developers to take a closer look at performance benchmarking and pre-launch performance checks.\n\nThere are several advantages of preliminary service benchmarking, which may extensively enhance the response time, resolve glitches, enhance the application's robustness, and bring together several other commendable factors, including but not limited to stability and dependability within an application.\n\nThere are several tools for performance benchmarking. A major one is the interconnected relationship between load generators and benchmarks. Some of the well-known load generators in the cloud native realm are:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Fortio</li>\n    <li>Wrk2/Wrk</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nThe conclusion can be encapsulated as following, Meshery, the cloud native management plane possesses the ability to generate load and benchmark services in/out of your service mesh using Fortio, Wrk2 and now, Nighthawk too.\n\n### Meshery + Nighthawk = Robust Distributed and Scalable Services\n\nNighthawk, written and maintained by the Envoy Community, is a L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool that supports performance benchmarking using HTTP or gRPC services.\n\nNighthawk is built using open-source builds and test tool Bazel and supports output formatting to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards. To add more to the list, it will soon support distributed performance benchmarking which is currently under an active development stage.\n\nOn the other hand, Meshery, written and maintainer by Layer5 Community is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. With Meshery, you can both, manage your service mesh's lifecycle, and benchmark them with industry-grade tools to let you know how much under or over-utilized your services are.\n\n<img src={smpImg} alt=\"smp-image\" className=\"image-left smp-image\"/>\n\nSoon, Meshery is going to be a canonical implementation for [Service Mesh Performance](https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance) which is a common and standardised format to describe : - Performance test configuration - Service mesh configuration - Environment configuration - Workload configuration - Performance test results.\n\n### How did we achieve it ?\nThe following project was proposed as a Google Summer of Code Idea, I was selected as a student mentee to draft the design, architecture and code my way from scratch. On my journey, I received guidance from some amazing mentors, colleagues and open-source stake holders. I discussed the design proposal with Envoy Team as well as Layer5 Team and from suggestions from both, I was able to complete my project.\n\nIn the course of the project, I came up with the idea of invoking Nighthawk as a separate container with which Meshery will communicate using a go-lang based middleware.\n\nTo my elation, the project was a huge success and Nighthawk is now invoked as a load-generator in Meshery. Soon, the public release for the new version will be made and users will be able to utilize Nighthawk as a performance-benchamark tool alongside with Fortio and Wrk2.\n\n### What's next?\nThis is just the first relay, in the long run, there are many more milestones to come. The following is a list of projects which will be completed in upcoming months:\n\n- Invoke Nighthawk as an gRPC Service and support gRPC connection between Nighthawk & Meshery.\n- Implement user-profiles for performance benchmarking which may store some preset preferred values according to users.\n- Enhance Nighthawk to support distributed load generation and performance benchmarking.\n- NATS & gRPC Performance Benchmarking for gRPC and NATS services invoked in Meshery.\n\nand many more awesome and bleeding-edge ideas.\n\n### How can I get involved?\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it. Head over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #performance channel where everything related to performance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to Performance Benchmarking, SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Performance benchmarking using Meshery and Nighthawk","date":"Sep 19th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/mesheryctl.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRj4AAABXRUJQVlA4IDIAAADwAgCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYwCdAC0kAAD+8Ft1agncm7Dve5aKGf5sAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/4a552/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/571ff/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/1866d/mesheryctl.webp 1366w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42552083333333335}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/mesheryctl.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRj4AAABXRUJQVlA4IDIAAADwAgCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYwCdAC0kAAD+8Ft1agncm7Dve5aKGf5sAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/4a552/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/571ff/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/1866d/mesheryctl.webp 1366w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42552083333333335}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/performance/performance-benchmarking-using-meshery-and-nighthawk"}},{"id":"41186fe5-9702-5f79-9115-7013aba6492e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport conformance from \"./conformance-results.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nReleased on August 5th, 2020 by Microsoft, [Open Service Mesh](https://openservicemesh.io/) (OSM) is a lightweight and [Service Mesh Interace conformant](https://layer5.io/smi) (SMI). Open Service Mesh is a contemporary addition to the [service mesh landscape](/service-mesh-landscape). Using Envoy as its data plane proxy component and SMI specifications as it's control plane APIs, OSM draws lessons and code from existing service mesh projects, like Linkerd. The Open Service Mesh project has some miles to go as it is one of a growing list of choices available in the service mesh landscape.\n\nFirst pronounced to be SMI compliant by [Meshery](https://meshery.io/), the cloud native management plane, the first release of OSM supports a myriad of basic\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Securing service to service links</li>\n    <li>Supporting traffic shifting</li>\n    <li>Managing observability for your services</li>\n    <li>Validating and Implementing access control policies</li>\n    <li>Auto addition of applications and services</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Get started with OSM using Meshery\nIn Layer5's effort to support our multi-mesh world, our Meshery project provides an effortless way for Kubernetes operators to install, maintain and run service meshes. [Meshery v0.4.3](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases/tag/v0.4.3) includes the [Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-osm), enabling you to quickly provision OSM, run any number of sample applications, manage its performance using [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io/) (SMP), validate OSM's compliance to SMI using a suite of conformance tests. Meshery offers configuraiton management with builtin best practice configuration analysis giving you confidence in applying custom configuration to OSM.

But, when it comes to contributing to Meshery it only gets more and more meshy!\n\n### Get set go!\n\nI was introduced to the world of open source through the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a> project in the august of 2019 and have since then been continuously exploring the farthest reaches of Meshery, Layer5, the parent SMI project and consecutively the CNCF landscape.\nAt the time of writing this, I have been a part of the Meshery project for about a year. Fascinated by the concept and further lured in by the welcoming community at Layer5, I was soon dipping my toes into the tidal wave of code. Starting out with small contributions to improve the UI, I stumbled on to my first issue, which was to open a page in a new tab instead of opening it in the same tab. Basic, right?\n\nI’m pointing this out to unravel the myth and smoke clouds around open source projects. Contributing can be as easy as altering a few lines of code and can be as meaningful as writing a whole new feature adapter. Since then, I have crossed small and big hurdles, meandering through countless issues and have become a part of the wholesome community, gaining friends and mentors along the way.\n\n### Stepping stones\n\nLet’s begin with the basics. What is Layer5?\n\nAt Layer5, we champion developer-defined infrastructure, giving engineers the power to reshape application delivery. We empower operators in reimagining how they manage modern infrastructure: collaboratively.\n\n### Roadblocks\n\nComing to my contributions at Layer5, I have mostly been involved in improving the UI and shaping the company site’s present outlook. I have also tried my hand at other projects, including the `mesheryctl` and the `landscape` at Layer5. In fact, here is a comprehensive list of **[my contributions across Layer5 projects](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+author%3ANikhil-Ladha+org%3Alayer5io)**.\n\nThe above mentioned links are just the **visible** contributions made by me. With time, I have grown and was soon approached to become a [MeshMate](/community/meshmates), an initiative which involves few seasoned contributors like me who will hold the hand of a new member and help him/her bridge the gap and take the leap into open source.\n\n### Tricks of the Trade\n\nThe benefits of being a UI engineer?\n\nWeb developers are required in every company in one meaningful way or the other as every single project needs a frontend to showcase it’s capabilities to the user. Coming to Layer5, the frontend of Meshery is built on React( another masterpiece from Facebook! ), which I learned from scratch when I joined the community.\n\n<img src={SignedBook} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"Nikhil-ladha-work\" />\n\nNow, months have passed and with some healthy dedication and hours of staring at thousands of lines of code, I have a good base and practical experience with React, something which you can’t hope to gain from personal projects and require a community for.\n\nThe Layer5 and Meshery websites are built using Jekyll, another technology about which I didn’t have any practical knowledge a couple of months ago. Easier than react and harder than CSS, Jekyll is perfect for the aspiring web developers out there and is also another reason for you to pop over to the Layer5 repo after reading this article.\n\n### Meshy goodness<br/>\n\nMy experience at Layer5 has made me proud of the work that we do and has challenged me time and again to reach for higher goals. I still have a hunch that someway or the other my contributions are responsible for getting me an internship at Red Hat! All heads bowed to [Lee Calcote](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote/) for his presence and guidance and to the Layer5 community for being as amazing as it is. My journey at Layer5 has been an ever growing curve to be honest from just a contributor to a MeshMate to the maintainer of few projects at Layer5. And, true to god this wouldn’t have been possible without the combined effort from me and our very own Lee Calcote. His trust and confidence in me is what encourages me to contribute more and more at Layer5 and see it grow to some next level in the coming future.\nMotivated or moved or still confused?\n\nWant to experience the same feeling and see yourself recognized as an Open-source contributor?\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My journey from a contributor to a maintainer!","date":"Aug 11th, 2020","author":"Nikhil Ladha","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-journey-from-a-contributor-to-a-maintainer"}},{"id":"ea2400da-2d3b-59c7-be79-7831ba9fc7fc","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport operator from \"./meshery-operator-dark.svg\";\nimport MesheryArchitecture from \"./meshery-architecture.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n[Meshery](https://meshery.io) is the cloud native management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of cloud native infrastructure and their workloads.\n\nLayer5 community members are hard at work providing our users with easy access to any cloud native infrastructureand myriad management features. New releases for Meshery are published on a frequent cadence with new features and bug fixes. Today, we are announcing version 0.4.0 of Meshery. This summary highlights Meshery's latest developments and elucidates new features.\n\n## What's New?\n\nThe v0.4.0 release of Meshery introduces a plethora of new features and bug fixes across cloud native infrastructure environments spanning Meshery and it's various adapters.\n\n### Meshery's CLI: `mesheryctl`\n**New Command Structure**<br/>\n`mesheryctl` commands and subcommands have been restructured in v0.4.0 into the categories:\n- Global Commands and Flags\n- Meshery Lifecycle Management\n- Performance Management\n- Infrastructure Lifecycle Management\n- Workload Lifecycle Management\n\nOrganizing commnands [under these categories](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) is done with both the intention to make `mesheryctl` functions intuitively at your fingertips, but also to make room for forthcoming functionality.\n\n**Exposing Performance Management in the CLI**<br/>\n`perf:` a new `mesheryctl`command. Introduction of new performance sub-commands, now benchmark your cloud native infrastructure at the tip of your fingers using our new CLI command `perf`.\n\n**Support for Scoop** <br/>\nSupport extended to Scoop Bucket. You can now install mesheryctl on your Windows machine with Scoop Bucket. Visit the [Meshery Scoop Bucket](https://github.com/layer5io/scoop-bucket) to install Meshery on Windows.\n\n**Rename `cleanup` to `reset`**<br/>\nThe `cleanup` is used to reset your Meshery deployment configuration back to its default settings. This command has been renamed to `reset` to more appropriately reflect its purpose.\n\n### MeshSync<br/>\n<img src={operator} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-operator-dark\" />\n\n-  A component of the [Meshery Operator](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator), MeshSync can scan the environment to get the deployment details of specific types of cloud native infrastructure and the connected Kubernetes cluster.\n-  MeshSync is a new component addition to Meshery. Meshery needs to be constantly updated given that cloud native infrastructure and their underlying infrastructure are dynamic, constantly changing.  Meshery operations should be resilient in the face of this change.\n-  MeshSync brings a infrastructure agnostic object model that defines relationships between all objects under management.\n\n### Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh (beta)<br/>\n\n<img src={MesheryArchitecture} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-architecture\" />\n\n- [Citrix Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx) is now a supported integration. Meshery incorporates support for the Citrix ADC CPX, which is a cloud-ready, container-based application delivery controller that can be provisioned on a Docker host.\n- CPX runs as the Istio Data Plane component, displacing Envoy as the default data plane service proxy.<br/>\n\n### Security & Authentication\n\n- Meshery has moved from using session authentication to JWT authentication. Meshery's JWT authentication is powered by Hydra Auth.\n- You can now opt to authenticate yourself on mesheryctl while performing performance tests using `mesheryctl`, you can authenticate yourself by getting the JWT Token from Meshery UI.\n\n### Meshery Server\n\n- Support provided for [wrk2 as an alternative load generator](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#load-generators).\n- [Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility) - A new project construct that allows users to select authentication, long-term storage etc.\n- Ad-hoc [connectivity tests for Prometheus and Grafana](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#grafana-and-meshery) are now supported.\n- Extraneous information beyond IP address and port in Grafana and Prometheus endpoints have been stripped off.\n\n### Meshery UI\n\n- ES-Lint has been added to the client side to ensure the quality of code and increase maintainaiblity of code.\n- Cypress has been set-up to enable end-to-end tests and integration tests for Meshery UI.\n\n<center><iframe frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowfullscreen={true} mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowfullscreen={true} mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9D2KgZKxo\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></center>\n\n\n### Other notable changes\n\n- From within the [Meshery Continuous Integration Working Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9D2KgZKxo&list=PL3A-A6hPO2IM7rYiKxG4l3eQNc6X3IUex), we have strengthened our continuous integration (CI) actions & tests by introducing new workflows like `static check`, `vet check`, `security check` for our server code.\n- ReleaseDrafter & WelcomeBot has been added to the repository to enable automation of release notes and for welcoming new contributors, respectively.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.4.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/project/releases)\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of cloud native infrastructure, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Meshery v0.4.0","date":"Aug 7th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-meshery-v040"}},{"id":"a45a606d-6f4a-5ecd-883a-d61a271c015d","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nI started a new job at [RemoteState](https://www.linkedin.com/company/remotestate/) as a software development engineer in May of 2020.\nPost the initial plunge, settling into the role was relatively easier for me due to the experience I had gained in working on open source contributions in the Layer5 community. My experience with open source had also been a big plus for me throughout the application and interview process. As a direct result, my colleagues and seniors became genuinely inquisitive about Meshery and its functionality as the Kubernetes Manager. So when asked, I happily agreed  to deliver a session on the subject to the entire team.\n\nI pitched my idea to [Lee Calcote](https://layer5.io/community/members/lee-calcote) and in his usual supportive form, he was as excited as I was about the session. A brainstorm session led to creating an entire presentation with suggestions from Lee. The Layer5 community offers a number of resources to contributors, including these two decks ([Meshery - the cloud native management plane](https://layer5.io/meshery) and [Layer5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tLcMcyQ-Z6YYISYyR0Eyb30dojQiKHIjs7Rt5m8kcag/edit?usp=sharing) that I drew from as a basis for a personalized presentation and demonstration to my new team.\n\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQNpnp_SIkYNMe1rx-Cw_armxHRmQvkcp8d3BVML6XEhsSgy7k0w9xDKrGGs4EPew/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowfullscreen={true} mozallowfullscreen=\"true\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></center>\n\nWhen the day arrived to present the concepts of cloud native infrastructure, Meshery, and other cloud native initiatives to my team, I held a Google Meet with a full attendance. I started the session with a reader’s digest version of microservices and cloud native infrastructure to set the stage for any newcomers to the world of cloud native, I went on to elaborate on Layer5 ‘s contributions to the CNCF landscape and the SMI project. This was followed by an in-depth discussion on data planes, control planes, and management planes. I spoke at-length about Meshery’s functionality including, its features for facilitating the benchmarking, interoperability and standardization of cloud native infrastructure. I wrapped up the session with some insider tips that I have learned in my months as an open source contributor in the Layer5 community. In the stream of feedback received from my colleagues, the session seems to have been a success.\n\nThis whole experience has been an amazing journey for me. From being a complete noob to utilizing my expertise in the cloud native infrastructure domain to landing an actual job, the experience has been a maze of ups and downs. But, I feel like I have finally arrived and arrived with a pot of gold. I’m eternally grateful to Lee Calcote for motivating me and providing me with the appropriate resources. Entering and exploring an open source community can be a daunting task and the [resources provided by Layer5](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) helped them in overcoming that challenge and enabled them to learn more about the widespread work of [Meshery](https://meshery.io).\n\nI’m glad to have found a community that not only feeds my professional success, but also my personal growth. It’s not out of obligation, but out of a sense of gratitude and paying it forward to others (a tenant of the Layer5 community) that I now spend much of my time as a MeshMate. I help welcome and guide other new contributors along their open source path as they learn and grow. Giving to others and while continuing to grow professionally and personally is time well spent.   I encourage you to join me and others in the Layer5 community by jumping into our [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/) to start meshing around!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How I schooled my seniors","date":"Aug 4th, 2020","author":"Nupur Thakur","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/15f20/feature-image.webp 750w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/9a568/feature-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp 1188w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6691919191919192}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/feature-image.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSF4AAAABcFpt27J8v7sk/380ERmBOWwLKsmhc4juJLrv4gtwvvS2XxeIiAlACeark4bkVphgrePp2JMMMtj4DucpCq4X2yu8GYVASH5As1QmQyhPzMoZLtDz9wf4hcUQZboAVlA4IIoAAACwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCsAYrI25c7SvXkAAD+umS2vni5SImjbx+v5BUxUn7iPyIaKDY6Gm99Y2ImBYdyz7Ydh65Snkvyd+DBk9ETRxgkgcVTLx+f8Hlcet4wASc/0+Df/6sSXMpfq7ynCaLQ6QdkG9mmv0DcG1NJYgY0AAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/15f20/feature-image.webp 750w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/9a568/feature-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/3e63cd611bad7c47478b14218b862656/2b3e6/feature-image.webp 1188w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6691919191919192}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/how-i-schooled-my-seniors"}},{"id":"47a58ab5-c67e-52d4-ae1d-1623eeab8aed","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport listioLayer5 from \"./layer5-and-istio.webp\";\nimport img1 from \"./image1.webp\";\nimport img2 from \"./image2.webp\";\nimport img3 from \"./image3.webp\";\nimport img4 from \"./image4.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img src={listioLayer5} className=\"image-left\" alt=\"Layer5 and Istio\"/>\n\nRecently, I started learning on Service Mesh and it was a very interesting journey as I explored the Service Mesh\nlandscape starting with [Layer5 tutorials](https://github.com/layer5io/istio-service-mesh-workshop) and by exploring\nthe blogs at [Istio.io](https://istio.io/).\n\nOur organization decided to use the features of Istio for securing, managing and automating microservices. However, we have to support a multi-tenant environment and that became a challenge due to lack of sufficient documentation and clarity. To give a little bit of background on the problem, we have a single cluster with multiple tenants in different namespaces sharing the same cluster . We do not want to provide each tenant their own separate Kubernetes Cluster because that would be additional provisioning overhead, management overhead and also additional resource overhead on the platform.\n\nIn this blog, I will go over the concepts and visual representation as well as the steps to learn and build your setup.\nNow there are different combinations possible depending on the requirements. These could be :\n\n1. Single Istio Control Plane with its own Ingress-Gateway to ensure traffic for the control plane is coming via the same control plane Ingress-Gateway.\n1. One or more Workspace namespaces for the workload applications and each with its own instance of the ingress gateway\n1. More advanced scenario would be multiple Control Plane and its associated Data Plane or essentially Multiple Service Mesh within a single Kubernetes Cluster. This is presently feasible using the Maistra Istio Operator, but its not fully supported using the upstream Istio at present. I intend to go over this use case in a later article.\n\nHere by Ingress Gateway we mean the Istio Ingress Gateway and not the Kubernetes Ingress Gateway.\nNow, before we get into the steps for building an Istio Multi-tenant setup, lets quickly review the prerequisite :\n\n- Kubernetes setup (in the steps below I am using v1.18 on ubuntu 18.04)\n\n  ```sh\n  $ sudo apt-get install -y docker.io\n  $ sudo sh -c “echo ‘deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main’ >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list”\n  $ sudo sh -c “curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -”\n  $ sudo apt-get update\n  $ sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.18.1–00 kubelet=1.18.1–00 kubectl=1.18.1–00\n  $ sudo kubeadm init — kubernetes-version 1.18.1 — pod-network-cidr 192.168.0.0/16\n  $ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube\n  $ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config\n  $ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config\n  $ kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml\n  ```\n\n- Get the latest istioctl binary\n\n  ```sh\n  $ curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -\n  cd istio-*\n  export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH\n  istioctl version\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the Istio Operator\n  ```sh\n  $ istioctl operator init\n  Using operator Deployment image: docker.io/istio/operator:1.6.3\n  ✔ Istio operator installed\n  ✔ Installation complete\n  $ kubectl get all -n istio-operator\n  NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\n  pod/istio-operator-5998f6c744-vrkbk 1/1 Running 1 78m\n  NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE\n  service/istio-operator ClusterIP 10.107.183.94 <none> 8383/TCP 78m\n  NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE\n  deployment.apps/istio-operator 1/1 1 1 78m\n  NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE\n  replicaset.apps/istio-operator-5998f6c744 1 1 1 78m\n  ```\n\nNext we will look into the details of the multitenancy scenarios; but before that a few word on the Istio operator would be nice. The Istio Operator follows the Kubernetes Controller and Custom Resource Definition mechanism and basically the above steps create an Istio operator controller in the istio-operator namespace and also registers the CRDs in the Kubernetes Registry. Basically, it extends the API for Kubernetes and allows management of a Custom Resource(CR). A word of caution, the existing upstream Istio Operator does not follow any Operator Framework like kubebuilder or Operator SDK. Hence, many of the expected behavior fail like trying to create two Istio Operator Custom Resource(the community mentions it as `iop` instances) in different namespaces or multiple `iop` instances and are under heavy development.\n\nOk, so now lets jump into action. We will build our Istio Setup for the scenario 1 &2 above shown in the diagram below. There are three different instances of Ingress Gateway(and it could be egress gateway as well) :\n\na. Ingress Gateway in Control Plane for traffic entry point to the Control plane Observability Components like `Kiali`(for the Service Mesh Graph), `Prometheus`(for metrics),Grafana(for visual charts of the metrics)and `Jaeger` (for distributed tracing between the services)\nb. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 1 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 1 microservices.\nc. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 2 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 2 microservices.\n\n<img src={img1} alt=\"kubernetes-cluster\"/>\n<div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>\n\n  Single Control Plane with Multiple Data Plane each with separate Ingress\n  Gateway\n\n</div>\n- Creation of Control Plane CR and Data Plane CR\n  A sample CR for creation of the Control plane and Data Plane CR can be referred below :\n  ```sh\n  $ cat iop-platform.yaml\n  apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1\n  kind: IstioOperator\n  metadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: platform-istiocontrolplane\n  spec:\n  profile: demo\n  $ cat iop-wk1-gw.yaml\n  apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1\n  kind: IstioOperator\n  metadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: wk1-gwconfig\n  spec:\n  profile: empty\n  components:\n  ingressGateways:\n  - name: wk1-ingressgw\n  namespace: workspace-1\n  enabled: true\n  label:\n  istio: ingressgateway-1\n  app: istio-ingressgateway-1\n  values:\n  gateways:\n  istio-ingressgateway:\n  debug: error\n  $ cat iop-wk2-gw.yaml\n  apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1\n  kind: IstioOperator\n  metadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: wk2-gwconfig\n  spec:\n  profile: empty\n  components:\n  ingressGateways:\n  -

port:\n  number: 80\n  name: http\n  protocol: HTTP\n  hosts:\n  - “*”\n  $ cat istio/bookinfo-gateway-2.yaml\n  apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n  kind: Gateway\n  metadata:\n  name: bookinfo-gateway\n  spec:\n  selector:\n  istio: ingressgateway-2 # use istio gateway-2 controller in workspace-1\n  servers:\n  - port:\n  number: 80\n  name: http\n  protocol: HTTP\n  hosts:\n  - “*”\n  ```\n\n\nDeploy the applications in workspace-1 and workspace-2 and deploy the Gateway, VirtualService and DestinationRules.\n\n{/* */}\n\n```sh\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n workspace-1\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n workspace-2\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n workspace-1\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n workspace-2\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml -n workspace-1\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml -n workspace-2\n```\n\nEssentially what is happening is the Gateway CR is configuring the traffic to come via the ingress-gateway, it specifies the label selector based on which the ingress-gateway is selected and the host from where the traffic is allowed and port on which the traffic is allowed. It is important to ensure the label maps the label on the ingress-gateway.\nOnce this is done the traffic will start flowing the intended gateway and it could be observed on the Kiali dashboard.\nPlease note that in this scenario the Kiali is also accessed via the default control plane ingress-gateway running in the istio-system control plane namespace.\n\n<img src={img3} alt=\"image\" />\n<div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>Kiali view for Workspace-1</div>\n<img src={img4} alt=\"image\" />\n<div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}>Kiali view for Workspace-2</div>\nShortly, we will go over the 3rd scenario which is to run multiple Istio Control Planes (Multiple Service Meshes) within the same Kubernetes Cluster. For that, we will need to build an open-shift setup and deploy the Maistra Istio Operator.\nSpecial thanks to the [Istio Community](https://istio.slack.com/) for helping me understand the concepts and also answering my queries and of course to [Lee Calcote](https://calcotestudios.com/talks/), who helped me embark on my Istio journey.\n\n<div>\n\n  <b>\n    Connect with Sudeep Batra on\n    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudeep-batra\"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/sb1975\">GitHub</a>, or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sudeepbatra\"> Twitter</a>.\n  </b>\n\n</div>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh (Istio) patterns for Multitenancy","date":"Jul 18th, 2020","author":"Sudeep Batra","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/image2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkYAAABXRUJQVlA4IDoAAAAwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJaQAAetGLLsAAAP7vhDiT/XpMBU3mvncWVJalRVYSIAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp","srcSet":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/1f1d0/image2.webp 750w,\n/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp 1050w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.638095238095238}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/image2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkYAAABXRUJQVlA4IDoAAAAwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJaQAAetGLLsAAAP7vhDiT/XpMBU3mvncWVJalRVYSIAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp","srcSet":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/1f1d0/image2.webp 750w,\n/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp 1050w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.638095238095238}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/service-mesh/service-mesh-istio-patterns-for-multitenancy"}},{"id":"84298721-6095-5aac-89d3-02e19185dfe3","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport pic1 from \"./pic1.webp\";\nimport pic2 from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\nimport pic3 from \"./pic3.webp\";\nimport pic4 from \"./pic4.webp\";\nimport pic5 from \"./pic5.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nIt all started 9 months ago when I stumbled across the following LinkedIn post, written by a college senior who had recently scored an internship with Redhat.\n\n<img src={pic3} alt=\"book\"/>\n\nThis led me to a long-winding conversation with Subham Kumar Rai and Anand Kumar Singh about Layer5 and how amazing an opportunity it would be to be a part of this emerging community. I did some research on Kubernetes and made my way to the Layer5 Github repo. From there, it was a swift journey to the Layer5 Slack Channel where I truly understood what Subham had meant about the warm welcome. I was amazed by how helpful and willing the entire community was. Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).\n\n<img src={pic4} alt=\"github-profile\"/>\n\n#### What is Meshery?\n\nMeshery is a multi-platform management that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of Kubernetes and cloud platforms and applications.<br/>\n\n<img src={pic1} alt=\"meshry\"/>\n\nAs a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.\n <br/>\nMeshery seamlessly integrates with every CNCF project, your existing tools, multiple Clouds and Kubernetes clusters.<br/>\n\n<img className=\"align-right\" src={pic2} alt=\"Lee Calcote\" />\n\n#### Lee Calcote\n\nLee Calcote is an innovative leader and has previously made waves in the tech community as a Docker Captain and a Cloud Native Ambassador and that is just a milestone in his impressive journey, which consists of his admirable work with developer platforms, cloud technology, containers, functions, and applications. Advanced and emerging technologies have been a consistent focus through Calcote’s tenure at SolarWinds, Seagate, Cisco, and Pelco. In my tenure at Layer5, Lee has been an amazing mentor, someone you can always look towards for encouragement, inspiration and a kind word, especially when you’re melting under the heat to make that late night deadline.\n\n\n#### Layer5 and UEM Jaipur Partnership Program\nIn an effort to foster the open source community in my college, I along with four of my batchmates (Anand, Subham, Nikhil, Gunjan) decided to start an open source partnership program, encouraged by Lee and Rupayan Das (Faculty, UEM Jaipur). This will hopefully lead to making future batches more aware about the essence of open source and encourage them to participate in communities like Layer5.\n\n<img src={pic5} alt=\"layer5\"/>\n\n#### Community Love\n\nThe Layer5 community has welcomed me with patience and has given me a sense of purpose, which is more than I could have asked for at the beginning as a novice developer. The warm welcome and a sincere string of mentors can do wonders in building your confidence and enabling you to put in your best foot forward. Open source has introduced me to a horde of essential qualities, such as the importance of teamwork, candor and earnestness. <br/>\nIt has been a prodigious journey so far and I don’t intend to stop here. The pace at which the projects under the Layer5 community are unwinding is awe-inspiring. It is my aim to be a witness and a partner in crime in its future endeavors.

The Community Bridge Mentorship is a structured remote learning opportunity for aspiring open source software developers. The projects they host are mentored by experienced open source project developers and maintainers.\n\n<h4> Stumbling into Service Mesh Interface (SMI) </h4>\n\nI began working on SMI Conformance testing under the guidance of Lee Calcote, Founder of Layer5, in February 2020. Since then, my path into the world of service meshes has brought me an avalanche of opportunities and has helped me grow by leaps and bounds as a developer.\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a standard interface that encapsulates various common service mesh functionalities. It explains several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), their configuration variables, and their corresponding effect on the service mesh underneath in full detail. What makes SMI vital is that these CRDs are generic, and the specifications are implemented and actively followed up by various service meshes. Some of these service meshes have developed adapters that define SMI CRDs as a wrapper over the APIs they already provide, instead of adhering to the SMI spec internally. SMI specifications address essential features for the most common service mesh use cases:\n\n<img className=\"image-right\" src={smiLogo} alt=\"smi-logo\"/>\n\n- Traffic policy – To apply policies like identity and transport encryption across services\n- Traffic telemetry – To capture key metrics like error rate and latency between services\n- Traffic management – To shift traffic between different services\n\nHowever, at the moment, no service meshes adhere to the SMI specifications completely. Service meshes are rapidly developing and making active efforts to extend their feature set. Simultaneously, SMI has also been working towards adding more features to its specifications.\n\nConsequently, it becomes a necessity for continual validation of service mesh conformance with respect to SMI specifications and  the various versions of those specifications. The process of verifying conformance needs to be standardized and tooling made available.  Hence, our project efforts to create an SMI conformance tool.\n\n<h4> Meshery to the Rescue </h4>\n\nMeshery is the multi-service mesh management plane, offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. It is closely connected to the Kubernetes cluster and allows easy deployment of various service meshes and sample applications onto those meshes. Meshery enables operators to run performance tests on workloads, collect, store, and manage the test results.\n\n\nWe had found our solution. By leveraging the features provided in Meshery, we would be able to focus on the conformance validation and testing instead of sweating over the complexity in deployments. We can also use the performance management infrastructure to manage the conformance tests and their results. And so,  the tool will be developed as an integral part of Meshery to aid and abate SMI conformance woes.\nWe are now enhancing Meshery to automate the process of verifying conformance against a standard set of tests against a sample workload designed specifically for SMI conformance testing. By the time we’re through, this capability of Meshery will allow each project to validate its conformance to each version of the SMI specifications and will provide a detailed report.\n\n<h4> My Projects </h4>\n\nThe goals accomplished in my tenure at Layer5 are summarized as follows:\n\n1. **[Meshery Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility)** - Ported Meshery and its remote provider from using session based authentication to JWT based auth. This opened doors to:\n    - Usage of refresh tokens for longevity of sessions instead of asking user to re-login frequently.\n    - CLI based authentication (not done yet, but is on the roadmap)\n2. **[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub)** - WASM based envoy network packet filters in Rust-lang. Built a demo app demonstrating its potentials; we also built a  WASM filter which performs custom user specific rate limiting. This app was demo’ed in Dockercon 2020 under the header “Service Meshing with Docker Desktop and WebAssembly”.\n3. **[Implementing the Service Mesh Performance Specification](/projects/cloud-native-performance)** - Enhanced Meshery’s performance testing and profile management capabilities. Added support for customizing the requests made by the load generator, and added the capability of using performance test profiles in the tool.\n\nYou can find my code in the [**Learn Layer5 repository**](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/).\n\n<h4> Love for the Community </h4>\n\nI have been actively involved in the Layer5 community for a number of months now and am proud of the contributions I have made to various projects under the Layer5 banner. The Layer5 community represents an eclectic mix of geeky developers, out of the box thinkers, sassy writers and some of the most amazing people I have met so far in the open source community.  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment, and operational best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, and more. I am truly ecstatic to be a part of such an enthusiastic and welcoming community.<br/>\n\nAs you’ve made it to the end of my post, why not stick around and take a look at the amazing projects I just described? You might just find your dream project and if not, I can promise that you will at least end up becoming a part of one of the best open source communities out there.<br/>\nTo stay tuned with the progress of the project, please join us in the [Slack](http://slack.layer5.io) channel!\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CommunityBridge 2020: Teaching service meshes to be compliant","date":"Jul 16th, 2020","author":"Kanishkar J","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/7513b/communitybridge.webp 750w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/317ed/communitybridge.webp 1080w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5233333333333333}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/7513b/communitybridge.webp 750w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/317ed/communitybridge.webp 1080w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5233333333333333}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/communitybridge-2020-teaching-service-meshes-to-be-compliant"}},{"id":"8e28ec79-117e-5c1c-a35f-e6716f1adde9","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport IshitaProfile from \"./ishita-kumar-profile.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={IshitaProfile} alt=\"Ishita Kumar Profile\"/>\n\nAs a graduate student at the Indiana University Bloomington, studying for my Masters in Computer Science, little did I consider that my thesis project would lead me on this amazing journey to becoming an open source contributor.\n\nMy adventure with Layer5 has been a highly informative and invigorating experience, from coming aboard as a Meshery user to becoming an open source contributor. My initial interest in Layer5 was sparked when, for a project in my Masters course, I was required to build a microservice architecture and develop a service layer on top of it.\nA basic Google search led me to a plethora of resources, which in turn led me to understand how different DevOps technologies could be compared. Comparison and selection of a cluster was my first step to deploying one on my VM cluster. Amidst the varied resources available to me, stumbling onto Layer5 and Meshery was a happy boon.\n\n## Why Meshery?\n\nFrom the beginning, Meshery proved to be an intuitive and easy-to-use application. Among other benefits, it could be implemented into my project with ease which was also a major contributing factor behind my choice of taking advantage of its features for my project thesis.\n\nThere are tons of resources online that compare different DevOps tools for your deployment, however, Meshery was the only project that actually offered a practical way of comparing your Kubernetes clusters. In just a few easy steps, I could download and deploy  Meshery into my VM instance and compare the performance of my microservice application running atop two different infrastructure configurations. It gathered various statistics on how they worked on my application.\n\nWhat really got my hooked though was Meshery's intuitive UI and the amazing open platform support, which made me strive to rise above and beyond my project goals, to truly understand and value the underlying idea.\n\n## Insights While Meshing Around\n\nWhile using Meshery to deploy both Istio and Linkerd, I came to the understanding that while Meshery uses common methods for interfacing with and managing cloud services, that Meshery is also capable of fully configuring all my infrastructure. This became apparent by how robust Meshery’s adapter for Istio is, which includes the ability to analyze and validate my deployment’s configuration against best practices. Each adapter includes a set of sample applications that makes it convenient to explore the functionality of different meshes, using the same application across them.\n\nThe behavior that was of keen interest to me, however, was that of my custom, microservices. When deploying my microservices application, Meshery helped me understand how different infrastructure was interacting with my software application.\n\nI learned that in addition to the easy integration of Meshery in my application, it also provides one of the best platforms out there to manage modern infrastructure configuration and gives you a fair assessment of your deployment, which can otherwise prove to be a daunting task.\n\nWhile presenting my findings to my class and professor, they were able to gauge the value that each piece of tech would bring into the microservice application.\n\n## Shout out to the Community\n\nThe Layer5 community has proved to be incredibly helpful in my journey. Communicating mainly through Slack channels, the community is vibrant and very welcoming. Any integration issues that arose for me were quickly and efficiently solved. <br />\nI am thankful that my experiences as a user, as well as a contributor, has allowed me to be a valued part of this wholesome group. Layer5 has truly made me understand the significance of an open source \"community\" and I’ll admit - I’m hooked. The number and variety of novel projects that are pushing the envelope of emerging technology within this community is enthralling. <br/>\nI’m here for the long-haul, so expect to hear from me again as I wrap my arms around these projects. If the suite of Layer5 projects interests you, please [join the community](http://slack.layer5.io)!  <br />\nThen, drop me a line as I work toward becoming a [MeshMate](https://layer5.io/community/meshmates).\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Meshy Journey","date":"Jul 3rd, 2020","author":"Ishita Kumar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp 666w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5870870870870871}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp 666w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5870870870870871}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/my-meshy-journey"}},{"id":"933fdd2b-b2a4-5371-bb9a-f047b72e3e23","body":"import { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport smilogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\nimport checklist from \"./checklist.svg\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img\n\tsrc={smilogo}\n\talign=\"right\"\n\talt=\"smilogo\"\n\twidth=\"200px\"\n\tstyle={{ margin: \"1rem 2rem\" }}\n/>\n\n### About SMI\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at [SMI Github Repository](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec). Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found [here](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md).\n\n### APIs in SMI\n\nCurrently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:\n\n- [Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs) - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.\n- [Traffic Access Control](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control) - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not\n- [Traffic Split](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split) - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing\n- [Traffic Metrics](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics) - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.\n\n### About SMI Conformance Tests\n\n**SMI Conformance Tests** check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?\n\nAll these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.\n\nSounds fun, right? Let's dig deeper into the SMI conformance project and find out.\n\n### Meshery'ing with Conformance Tests\n\n<img src={checklist} align=\"left\" alt=\"checklist\" width=\"250px\"/>\n\n<Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>  is _the cloud native management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.\n\nAs you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nDo you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).\n\n#### Forking [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/)\n\n`kuttl` is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It's entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked `kuttl` and modified it a little. You can see our modified version [here](https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl).\n\n\nWe are planning to use `kuttl` for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of `kuttl`.\n\n#### [Learn Layer5](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/)\n\nLearn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.\n\nThis is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and `smi-conformance` testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.\n\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.\nHead over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting SMI Conformance Testing with Meshery","date":"Jun 25th, 2020","author":"Naveen Kumar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/smi-conformance.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdMoRwABouJpxndAAA/rk5FTx5IAPyy7bwayFHbqZeUwT5kp/jZAeb6AaWX0+j97v2lRg8t8fOoRyxzRsu40wcUtoNkON2o0AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/d0012/smi-conformance.webp","srcSet":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/1cb46/smi-conformance.webp 750w,\n/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/d0012/smi-conformance.webp 1036w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4343629343629343}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/smi-conformance.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdMoRwABouJpxndAAA/rk5FTx5IAPyy7bwayFHbqZeUwT5kp/jZAeb6AaWX0+j97v2lRg8t8fOoRyxzRsu40wcUtoNkON2o0AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/d0012/smi-conformance.webp","srcSet":"/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/1cb46/smi-conformance.webp 750w,\n/static/1b5c57550ae99467aa7b1f4f632274dc/d0012/smi-conformance.webp 1036w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4343629343629343}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/starting-smi-conformance-testing-with-meshery"}},{"id":"32283426-1a74-5e55-bb59-58d77844180c","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport gsocLogo from \"./gsoc.webp\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<h4>How did it all start?</h4>\n<img src={gsocLogo} className=\"gsoc-image\" align=\"right\" alt=\"gsoc-image\" />\nI was introduced to the Layer5 community by our very own Lee Calcote, and since then I have been exploring the vast world of service meshes and their performance characteristics. Before being accepted as a Google Summer of Code intern, I had been working with the Layer5 community as an active contributor, exploring various new DevOps tooling like service meshes, the sidecar concept, and performance benchmarking of services. I have had a run-in with the Kubernetes community before and initially believed Kubernetes to be the final stage of DevOps, but I was happily surprised when I found out that the end of Kubernetes merely marked the entrypoint to a whole new world of service meshes.\nAnd so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2020 internship, which began on the night of May 3rd, 2020 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Admittedly, I had tried my best an year ago to get into GSoC’19 with another organisation but due to reasons only Google can tell you, I was not accepted. Everything happens for a reason though, right?\nSix months ago, if you would have told me that I would be working with service meshes, gRPC, load testing, performance benchmarking alongside prominent members of the open source world of Cloud Native, I would have ignored you with the least possible amount of prudence I could muster.\n<h4>What is my project about?</h4>\nMy GSoC project is to <strong>Enable Distributed Load Testing for various Service Mesh Planes using Envoy Nighthawk</strong>. For those who are not familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a>, it is a performance benchmark tool written and maintained by the Envoy community. We are in the process of incorporating Nighthawk into <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> - <i>the cloud native management plane</i>.Meshery already supports performance testing of service meshes using fortio & wrk2 and is maintained by the Layer5 community and is also a member of CNCF Landscape. Alongside this effort, we are creating a new industry standard: <Link to=\"/projects/cloud-native-performance\">Service Mesh Performance Specification</Link> which is another initiative of the Layer5 community to establish a common format for describing and capturing service mesh performance.\nIt has  been a month since I have started my GSoC’20 tenure with the Layer5 community, and in this month, I have learned a lot from my code contributions and mentor. I began with setting up the project roadmap and discussing the potential use cases of Nighthawk with its maintainers during my community bonding period. I came to know some incredible people during the community bonding from big tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Affirmed Networks, Red Hat and many more to list. Before incorporating Nighthawk, we had to make various enhancements in Meshery, like adding user preferences for performance settings, specifying the SMPS format for exporting and importing of load-test preferences, load-generator interface and more.\nI have learned a hoard of new things, like gRPC services and how they communicate using protocol buffers, load generation using fortio, writing handlers for various endpoints using golang, and some frontend architecture with Nextjs.\n<h4>About the community</h4>\nLayer5 has one of the healthiest open source communities that I have ever worked with. In the past, I have worked with a variety of well-maintained and large scale open source communities but I have never experienced a more welcoming and nurturing environment than Layer5. At Layer5, we respect each contributor and their contributions, whether it is a new adapter or just a typo fix. If you can contribute, please do. It’s that simple! With many awesome initiatives like SMPS, Distributed Load Testing, Performance Benchmarking, Learn Layer5, and Image Hub, the exponential increase of Layer5 and its various projects is inevitable.\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Summer of Code 2020: Service Mesh Performance with Envoy Nighthawk","date":"Jun 23rd, 2020","author":"Kush Trivedi","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/google-summer-of-code-2020-service-mesh-performance-with-envoy-nighthawk"}},{"id":"fbdb0105-a11c-58b8-b99e-f59449dd09f9","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport cncf from \"./cncf-landscape-stacked-color.svg\"\nimport cncfmeshery from \"./cncf-meshery-landscape.webp\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img src={cncf} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"cncf-landscape-stacked-color\" />\n\n### Digging into Service Meshes\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I got interested in service mesh technology. A customer needed some advanced routing capabilities and we started looking at Envoy and Istio. Then - invitations to talk about Istio at meetups and conferences started flowing in. That's when I got excited about progressive delivery capabilities that service meshes enable. I even wrote a Kubernetes Istio canary controller - BirdWatch.\n\n### Finding Meshery\n\nDigging deeper into what service meshes had to offer I discovered Meshery - the universal service mesh management plane. And immediately joined Layer5 - the great, welcoming open-source community that created it.\n\n### Community Matters\n\nBeing a member of Layer5 was one of the nicest community experiences I've ever had. Mainly thanks to community's founder and captain - Lee Calcote. He always makes sure everybody feels significant, included and motivated to participate. And this spirit spreads out to all community activities.\n\nIn no time, I had my first commits approved and merged and started joining weekly community and development video calls.\n\n### We're on CNCF Landscape!\n\nNow - I won't be reviewing Meshery in this post. I've spoken about it in this video and some great introductory articles by community members can be found here and here. This post is more of a celebration, because last week...\n\n<h5 style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}><i>Meshery now featured in the CNCF Landscape!</i></h5>\n\n<img src={cncfmeshery} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"cncf-meshery-landscape\" />\n\nAnd this is only the first step - there's already an application filed for Meshery to become a full-fledged CNCF sandbox project. I had a chance to collaborate on the sandbox proposal and am so eager for this to happen.\n\n### Getting Meshy\n\nThis is also an invitation to participate - Meshery is a young, ambitious project - it requires a ton of work to make it what it aims to become. Integrating with all of the leading service mesh solutions asks for extensive expertise. In many areas Meshery's functionality is still young. But these are normal growth stages, aren't they? To put it simple - the community and the project need more hands! And these should be your hands!\n\n<div style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }}><i>As already mentioned - Layer5 is a very welcoming bunch!</i></div>\nOpen source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! Hop on to Layer5 Slack and we'll happily embrace you and help you get started.\n\nAnd it's not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent.\n\nFor example - I sometimes wish I had more time and motivation to code new Meshery features or fix existing bugs. But instead I'm writing this post. Because lately I enjoy writing texts more than coding. Coding for longer than a couple of days at a time throws me into a coding fatigue… Actually also many other activities do. I'm just not very good at keeping a routine. But I'm sure many of you out there aren't like me. So why not join forces?\n\n### Join the cloud native community!\n\n* Meshery is an exciting opportunity to learn more about service meshes.\n* We're already on CNCF Landscape and are headed for the sandbox.\n* Now is a great time to hop on board. Are you ready? Get into the mesh pit!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meshery lands in the CNCF Landscape","date":"Jun 1st, 2020","author":"Anton Weiss","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/cncf-meshery.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABQBACdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZACdMoADgO9k6qEL53yk2sYAAP7Abw4XvX2jHGD89BNjRpE70cE2XMKPwIVX+4lLfd3o20v5GElRvyyyUrRwSFT2h/RDZdLxUwq/W4DautwG0qJ1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/82c33/cncf-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/678bf/cncf-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/00510/cncf-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/82c33/cncf-meshery.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.504}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/cncf-meshery.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABQBACdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZACdMoADgO9k6qEL53yk2sYAAP7Abw4XvX2jHGD89BNjRpE70cE2XMKPwIVX+4lLfd3o20v5GElRvyyyUrRwSFT2h/RDZdLxUwq/W4DautwG0qJ1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/82c33/cncf-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/678bf/cncf-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/00510/cncf-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/82c33/cncf-meshery.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.504}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/meshery-lands-in-the-cncf-landscape"}},{"id":"58ae43e0-f0b0-5c61-ab4f-b71e722508cc","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### Introduction to Meshery\n\nFor all those who are unaware of <a href=\"/meshery\">Meshery</a>, Meshery is a cloud native management plane which provides users with operational best practices, lifecycle and configuration management, but also interoperates between various infrastructure, while enabling you with the tools and knowledge to glean the most of out your infrastructure performance, while keeping your overhead to a minimum.\n\nMeshery's vision is to make the operating of any cloud infrastructure simplified. Meshery is created by the <Link to=\"/community\">Layer5</Link>.\n\nLayer5 is a community-first, Cloud Native company which has technology <Link to=\"/partners\">partnerships</Link> with various tech giants like Microsoft, CNCF, RedHat and many more to enlist. The community consists of open source leaders like maintainers of trending open-source projects, Google SoCers, Docker Captains, Cloud Native Ambassadors and many more (<a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\">join in!</a>).\n\n\n### What is mesheryctl?\n\nMeshery provides you with a clean, robust, streamlined command-line interface to manage and benchmark your infrastructure, `mesheryctl`. With `mesheryctl`, not only you can manage your adapters & containers but you can also benchmark your mesh using the command line. `mesheryctl` provides support to a number of platforms so that we never miss out users. `mesheryctl` can be installed with a single bash command by simply executing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n````\n\nin your terminal. You will see Meshery getting installed & fired up on port: 9081.\nYou will see the output as\n\n\n```\nExtracting mesheryctl-v0.3.14...\nArchive:  /Users/user/meshery.zip\n  inflating: LICENSE\n  inflating: README.md\n  inflating: mesheryctl\n\nInstalling mesheryctl in /usr/local/bin.\nmesheryctl installed.\npermissions moved to user\nRemoving installation files and opening Meshery...Updating Meshery now...\nPulling meshery          ... download complete\nPulling meshery-istio    ... done\nPulling meshery-linkerd  ... done\nPulling meshery-consul   ... done\nPulling meshery-octarine ... done\nPulling meshery-nsm      ... done\nPulling meshery-cpx      ... done\nPulling watchtower       ... done\n```\n\nand you will be able to see the Meshery UI on `https://localhost:9081`.\n\nIf you are wondering if bash is only way to get `mesheryctl`, then here is the list of platforms which you can get `mesheryctl` describing all the different ways to get it.\n\n<table className=\"table-1\" align=\"center\">\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n    <th align=\"left\">Platform</th>\n    <th >Supported?</th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td ><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker - Docker App</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/aks\">Kubernetes - AKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Kubernetes - Docker Desktop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/eks\">Kubernetes - EKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/gke\">Kubernetes - GKE</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes#helm\">Kubernetes - Helm</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/minikube\">Kubernetes - Minikube</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - Kubernetes - OpenShift</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Linux</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Mac</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#homebrew\">Mac - Homebrew</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows\">Windows</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#scoop\">Scoop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows#wsl\">WSL2</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td>Raspberry Pi</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<br/>\nWe believe we have not missed any of the popular platforms for what it’s worth, we will be rolling out support for RaspberryPi and OpenShift soon 🎉🎉🎉.\n\nIf you are thinking about the requirements you would have to run `mesheryctl`, so to your surprise, to successfully run `mesheryctl` you will only need :\n\n<table style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }} className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">a running Docker daemon</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n### Into the MesheryCTL\n\nOnce you have successfully installed, you will be having the power of a new CLI Command MesheryCTL. As you type `mesheryctl` into your terminal, you will be shown with the various sub-commands and flags `mesheryctl` can support.\n\n```\nMeshery is the cloud native management plane, providing lifecycle, performance, and configuration management of cloud infrastructure and their workloads.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  help        Help about any command\n  perf        Performance Management\n  system      Meshery Lifecyle Management\n  version     Print mesheryctl version\n\n\nFlags:\n      --config string    config file (default location is: $HOME/.meshery//meshery.yaml)\n  -h, --help            help for mesheryctl\n  -v, --version         Version of mesheryctl\n\nUse \"mesheryctl [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\n\nOnce you do `mesheryctl system start`, Meshery will pull its adapters and latest docker images. Meshery will also detect your Kubernetes configuration and will let you know if Kubernetes is running. Meshery will run it’s web-based user interface on localhost port `9081` and will let you select your choice of <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility#providers\">Provider</a> before you can start managing your infrastructure with this powerful utility.\n\n<table style={{ textAlign: \"center\" }} className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">One of the most interesting sub-commands of <code>mesheryctl</code> is <strong><code>perf</code></strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe `perf` subcommand enables you to being managing the performance of your cloud native deployment and your workloads running atop of them. It lets you benchmark your infrastructure without using the Meshery UI from the command line interface itself. Once you type `mesheryctl perf`, it will present you with all the powerful flags you can control with CLI, including providing it with a `--file` flag that points to any of a number of performance test profiles that you may have saved.\n\n```\nPerformance Management and Benchmarking using Meshery CLI.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl perf --[flags]\n\nAvailable Flags for Performance Command:\n  name[string]                  (optional) A short descriptor to serve as reference for this test. If not provided, a random name will be generate.\n  url[string]                   (required) URL endpoint to send requests.\n  duration[string]              (required) Length of time to perform test (e.g 30s, 15m, 1hr). See standard notation https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration\n  load-generator[string]        (optional) Name of load generator to be used to perform test (default: \"fortio\")\n  provider[string]              (required) Choice of Provider (default: \"Meshery\")\n  concurrent-requests[string]   (optional) Number of parallel requests to be sent (default: \"1\")\n  qps[string]                   (required) Queries per second (default: \"0\")\n  file[string]                  (optional) file containing SMPS-compatible test configuration. \n  help                          Help for perf subcommand\n\nurl, duration, concurrent-requests, and qps can be considered optional flags if specified through an SMPS compatible yaml file using --file\n```\n\nAn example usage of `mesheryctl perf --[flags]` can be\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --url http://192.168.1.15/productpage --qps 300 --concurrent-requests 2 --duration 30s --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\nYou can also provide a SMPS Configuration file with `perf` subcommand, with this file provided you will not have to specify url, duration, concurrent-requests & qps. However, if specified the value provided through file will be over-rided by value through CLI. For more info about file configuration, see [here](https://github.com/service-mesh-performance/service-mesh-performance/blob/master/docs/assets/spec/readme/service%20mesh%20performance%20specification%20result.yaml).\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --file {path}/smps.yaml --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\n### What's next?\n\nMeshery is an ever-growing community with attracting contributors from across the globe.

It is to provide an answer to these questions that the Layer5 community has created <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, the open-source, service mesh management plane. Meshery already supports a number of leading mesh providers with adapters for additional meshes on the way. In today’s video, I’ll show how to use Meshery for rolling out and evaluating Linkerd.\n\n Linkerd is a system that comes from the service mesh pioneers - the company called Buoyant. They were the first to realise the need for a distributed network of smart, centrally configured proxies and coin the term “service mesh” back in 2016. Today, we’ll be looking at Linkerd 2.x - the second generation of this now CNCF project.\n\n<h5>Meshery Adapters</h5>\n\n<table className=\"table-adapters\">\n    <thead className=\"hidden\">\n        <th>Status</th>\n        <th>Adapter</th>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"7\" className=\"stable-adapters\">stable</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-istio\"><img src={istio} alt='Istio Service Mesh adapter' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Istio</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-linkerd\"><img src={linkerd} alt='Linkerd' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Linkerd</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-consul\"><img src={consul} alt='Consul Connect' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Consul</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-octarine\"><img src={octarine} alt='Octarine Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Octarine</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-nsm\"><img src={nsm} alt='Network Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Network Service Mesh</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td className=\"stable-adapters\"></td></tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"2\" className=\"beta-adapters\">beta</td><td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx\">\nMeshery adapter for Citrix CPX</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td className=\"beta-adapters\"></td></tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td rowspan=\"6\" className=\"alpha-adapters\">alpha</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-maesh\"><img src={maesh} alt='Maesh Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Maesh</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-app-mesh\"><img src={awsappmesh} alt='AWS App Mesh Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for App Mesh </a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n        <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-kuma\"><img src={kuma} alt='Kuma Service Mesh' className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Kuma</a></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td></td></tr>\n    <tr><td className=\"alpha-adapters\"></td></tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\nSome things that Linkerd is known for:\n\n- Purpose-built for Kubernetes\n- Featuring custom-built, highly performant proxies written in Rust\n- Zero-config option (works out-of-the-box)\n- Network telemetry built-in (includes a pre-configured, optimised Prometheus instance)\n- Low-overhead control-plane\n- Operational simplicity (when compared to Istio, for example, even though Istio is getting better in this regard)\n\nSo what is covered in the video? More or less the following:\n\n- What service mesh tech allows us to do\n- What a typical service mesh architecture looks like\n- What Layer5 is about (<i>Lookout - it may surprise you!</i>)\n- What Meshery is. What Linkerd is.\n- How easy it is to install Meshery on your PC (be it Linux, Mac or Windows)\n- All it takes is:\n```sh\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n- How Meshery connects to your Kubernetes cluster (nothing to be done if it’s in your <code>kubectl config current-context</code>)\n- How to correctly install and remove Linkerd on your Kubernetes cluster using Meshery\n- How to install one of included Linkerd sample applications and verify the installation\n\nThat’s quite a lot of content for a 20 minute clip. In the follow-up videos, we’ll dive deeper into many of these concepts. And also show how to use Meshery with other service mesh providers.\n\nThis video is also the opening shot of Layer5's [Learn to Service Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A-A6hPO2IN_HSU0pSfijBboiHggs5mC) playlist, which is specifically dedicated to tutorials and webinars.

Shortly before writing my last post, I did open [one such pull request (layer5#238)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238). However, since my PR remains open, and since I am still working on the same issue my PR addresses, I have opted to instead push [a new commit](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/commits/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495) to the aformentioned (but, now, renamed) PR instead of creating a whole new one. This newest commit introduces a major step towards resolving the issue at hand, and will be the subject of this blog post!\n\n<img src={issueImage} alt=\"Issue\"/>\n\nThe issue at hand: [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211) - add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\n* * *\n\n_**Note:** this blog post will frequently reference [the update and documentation comment that I made](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644) to accompany my last commit to my PR. I consider this hefty comment to be an extension of this blog post, so I strongly recommend giving it a read!_\n\n* * *\n\nMy initial commit towards introducing comparative spectrum tooling did not represent a full solution. Thinking about what might constitute a full solution for the issue at hand, I came up with three criteria:\n\n## What was still needed:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nWithin [Issue #211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211), Layer5 lead developer Lee indicates [four slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6) upon which comparative spectrum graphics may be based upon. During my initial commit, I created graphics that emulated those found within the first three of those four slides, but I had yet to implement the graphic found in [the fourth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12): a table. I was also less-than-satisfied with the 'grid' design I had implemented in response to [slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p10).\n\n#### 2\\. A modular design\n\nThe designs I am implementing are meant to be used to present opinionated information. As I am not nearly knowledgeable to form opinionated comparisons between DevOps tools and related technologies, I have instead made my goal to make it as easy as possible for other Layer5 contributors to utilize the graphics (\"\\[comparative\\] spectrums\") that I am designing. Doing so would require encapsulating (templating) the spectrums I design (new and old), within their own HTML files, and providing a means to easily invoke (and customize) instances of those templates into the Landscape page.\n\n#### 3\\. Documentation\n\nBecause the templates I design are intended to be implemented and customized by other contributors, it is _especially_ critical that those contributors have access to complete and thorough documentation detailing the intended use of each templated design.\n\n* * *\n\n## What I delivered:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nAs documented in my [update comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644), I designed a table that very closely resembles that of Lee's slides. Implementing the table was interesting, as it ended up requiring [quite a few nested Liquid for-loops](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495/_includes/partials/spectrum/table.html#L23). Also as documented, I revamped the grid-based tooling and am quite pleased with the improvements made. The end result of these efforts is a complete set of comparative spectrums.\n\n#### 2, 3. A modular design and documentation\n\nThe bulk of the documentation I wrote details how to deal with the modular solution that I designed and implemented to enable comparative spectrums to be included into the Landscape page (through the use of Liquid `include` tags). The documentation speaks for itself; [check it out!](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644)\n\n## What's next?\n\nI would not have considered the documentation I delivered to be complete if I did not report on the issues still present in the work I delivered. I denoted these as 'Current issues' in the documentation, and they represent work that still remains to be done. I know that I can count on the Layer5 community to assist me with small issues like these, and, once this pull request receives some forward motion, I hope to start zeroing in on its smaller issues. Fortunately, I have made plans to continue working with open source well into the new year!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Layer5: Landscape Spectrums Revisited","date":"Dec 4th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9805825242718447}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9805825242718447}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/layer5-landscape-spectrums-revisited"}},{"id":"94ec3b54-c4c3-53cd-ad1b-e5a628ad968e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport pr211 from \"./PR-211.webp\";\nimport pr2112 from \"./PR-211-2.webp\";\nimport card1 from \"./card1.webp\";\nimport card2 from \"./card2.webp\";\nimport arrow from \"./arrow.webp\";\nimport gtable from \"./graphical-table.webp\";\nimport gcomp from \"./graph-compare.webp\";\nimport image21 from \"./image.webp\";\nimport comment from \"./comment.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nDuring [Hacktoberfest 2019](https://raungar.wordpress.com/tag/layer5/), I worked on the website of [Layer5](https://layer5.io/), open source community. More specifically, my contributions concerned one specific page of that website: its [Service Mesh Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nShortly after making these contributions, I was graciously welcomed into the Layer5 community by its lead developer [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote?lang=en), who later directly approached me to assist him in furthering his vision for the Landscape page by implementing \"comparative spectrums\". Wishing to focus on my remaining two Hacktoberfest contributions at the time, I suggested surveying the interest of other potential contributors for this project. As such, an informative issue was opened:\n\n<img src={pr211} alt=\"PR 211\"/>\n\nIssue [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211): add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\nA month later, I fortunately found time enough to make some major progress into this issue.\n\n* * *\n\nThis issue is quite highly conceptual, much moreso than any other issue I have thus far worked on. I decided that the best way to approach this issue would be to focus on establishing a set of tools that could be used by more-knowledgeable contributors to later construct comparative spectrums—opinionated data visualizations. As such, my first step was to build a set of responsive graphical elements that resembled [those provided as examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6). These include:\n\n#### (1) _Sleek information cards:_\n\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><img src={card1} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    <td> or this </td>\n    <td><img src={card2} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slides 5 and 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (2) _Gradiented, labelable double-arrow banners:_\n\n<img src={arrow} alt=\"Arrow\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (3) _Graphically-augmented tables:_\n\n<img src={gtable} alt=\"Table\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 8](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12))_\n\n#### (4) _Spectrum-like graphical comparisons:_\n\n<img src={gcomp} alt=\"Comparison\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n* * *\n\n(1) Although there may exist libraries that may help construct such graphical elements, I did not want to introduce additional libraries to accomplish my work. Instead, I wanted to make good use of Layer5io's preexisting [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) library. Fortunately, Materialize strongly supports the design of card-like structures, allowing me to more easily [implement some](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-20fc098534d6aab31ad8e5c9db51bde0R10).\n\n(2) Unfortunately, it does not seem that Materialize supports the creation of graphical arrows, so I just ended up [styling my own](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R2).\n\n(3) These tables can be quite easily implemented and styled with or without the use of `<table>` tags. I anticipate these will be given a proper fleshing out after the other graphical elements are further developed.\n\n(4) These unique spectrum graphics present the most challenging, of all the comparison tools, to implement. Snaking spectrum bar aside, I needed to develop a _responsive_ solution that (a) allowed contributors to programmatically place image thumbnails at preset horizontal positions, while (b) ensuring those thumbnails placed at the same position do not overlap with one another (and instead align vertically atop each other).\n\nThis presented a problem to solve: I required a means to 'float' elements toward a horizontal line; to 'stack' thumbnails atop one another, without overlap, if they are given the same horizontal position. After researching quite deeply into potential solutions to this problem, I ended up stumbling across some CSS property-value pairings that I had never heard of before: [`display: grid`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [`grid-auto-flow: row dense`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid-auto-flow.asp). Miraculously, I discovered that these could actually function as [a basis for a solution](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R76).\n\n* * *\n\nAfter styling the graphical elements, I continued the website's trend of using [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid) tags (e.g. [`for`](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/iteration-tags#for)) and [YAML lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) to help modularize my solutions, which should aid future contributors in generalizing them.\n\n* * *\n\nI opened [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238) to share my work as well as invite collaboration:\n\n<img src={pr2112} alt=\"PR 211-2\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): description of tooling introduced\n\n<img src={image21} alt=\"Image\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): example images of tooling introduced\n\nThe pull request was quite well-recieved:\n\n<img src={comment} alt=\"Comment\"/>\n\n[Comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-554181763) by Layer5 team lead on pull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238)\n\nAs I mentioned in a recent Layer5 community meeting, I am very excited to continue working with Layer5; to refine and expand upon this set of new, visionary tooling for their landscape!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Comparative Spectrums to the Layer5 Landscape","date":"Nov 15th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9805825242718447}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/landscape_green.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmIBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSJgAAAABcGPbtpr8WI1TJaGj1tYdWifWsjIF3K10eyUynD+oeEYQERNA9dYbi+s+pWIb1Q8WKhYF/PljFllk8d8U0xgUCEul+XwetyTM5/Oqpdh8Po1YQtEij8wwzRAyNPIMYR+wEjkCwM6HULrNGKSuoN2EFYBxWId7gf4bAODE6bwNdN+u+mBBMhQFUZIkAX9UbKNK9dYbi+s+BVZQOCCkAAAAMAUAnQEqFAAUAD7RXqZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWoAtPYgDeQAGMhLc1H/DL6oPzFChTu32AAA/jFFGJ8niSBnVreaWpa4nP1x1X+3nWWO4WVOC1xl9aML2H9tl9Df3+iYKwGacMsOsKsp0kuYqqfmS1VHbiUUqYm3IfxzOaPVeqOolkWIQKT4Stet4gyBZKd/Y1ANHBrDhHIu/CoOY2il6CMuIQxYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp","srcSet":"/static/5cf346a8332e49fcac54d6c02a4119cc/89f24/landscape_green.webp 206w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.9805825242718447}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/introducing-comparative-spectrums-to-the-layer5-landscape"}},{"id":"c8e6f627-3928-5937-8cef-5afff4fdcc96","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n(ICYMI: [I've made my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/)!)_\n\n[Hacktoberfest 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is now well underway, and I am happy to report that I have made my second contribution to my new favorite open source community, [**Layer5**](https://layer5.io/) ([on GitHub](https://github.com/layer5io))!\n\n_Before I continue on, I want to extend a huge thank-you to Layer5's lead developer, Lee Calcote, as well as the Layer5 community managers for welcoming me into the Layer5 Slack channel, allowing me to introduce myself in their weekly community meeting, and even giving my blog [an awesome shout out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/layer5/status/1180317604168306688?s=12)!_\n\n* * *\n\nThis week, I helped resolve the very first issue that I outlined in my [Planning for #Hacktoberfest 2019](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) post:\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-4.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-4.webp?w=1024)\n\nIssue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65): enhancements for the [Layer5 Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape)\n\nAt the time I found this issue, the second requested enhancement (concerning table row coloration) [was already handled](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commit/b313268cb578e762d1212c9910b522af2869b57b) by another contributor, leaving me with two tasks:\n\n1. Implementing the specified sorting functionalities (for the three tables on the [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape))\n2. Restyling the font color of site hyperlinks (an enhancement [requested later on](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65#issuecomment-483912458) in the issue)\n\n### The strange case of Jekyll\n\nFortunately, thanks to my previous work with Layer5's website, I was already all set up with an offline development environment. However, going into my first task, I knew very little about Jekyll except how to install it.\n\n_[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)... it's got to be like React or Angular, right? I mean, all I need to do is slap in [sort](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/sort/) and [reverse filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/reverse/) and toggle them onclick, right_...?\n\n_...Wait, what's a \"static site generator\"?_\n\n* * *\n\nAfter discovering what Jekyll and Liquid actually were, I determined that I would have to resort to DOM manipulation to fully accomplish my first task. However, I did succeed in accomplishing the default sorting behaviour by enhancing the Liquid tags being used by several tables.\n\nTo do so, I followed coding style on the issue's previous contributor by encapsulating my work within a new JavaScript file in the project's assets folder: a simple bubble sort function.\n\nI chose to implement the [simplest of sorting algorithms](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js#L13) in JavaScript (which I count as study for my _Data Structures and Algorithms_ midterm):\n\n\n```js\n// Excerpted from https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js\nlet bubbleSort = () => {\n  for (i = 0; i < rows.length-1; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j < rows.length-i-1; j++) {\n      if (shouldSwap(text(j), text(j+1))) {\n        rows[j].parentNode.insertBefore(rows[j+1], rows[j]);\n        didSort = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Painting over Pumpkin Bread\n\n[Encycolorpedia.com](https://encycolorpedia.com) lists the hex color code `#fdac40` as \"[Valspar Paint Pumpkin Bread](https://encycolorpedia.com/fdac40)\". Although Layer5.io's then-difficult-to-read hyperlinks were colored `#ffa_b_40`, I'd still like to think that the second task of my second Hacktoberfest contribution was festively-themed!\n\nIn [my last blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/), I mentioned that [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com) was worth further research. Well, after some poking around, I discovered that all of Layer5.io's pumpkin-colored hyperlink styling (both deliberate, and incidental) originated from its materialize.css asset.\n\nAlthough this asset has been [frequently modified](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commits/master/assets/css/materialize.css), I was still hesitant to globally alter the site's styling (in case a return to Pumpkin Bread was desired in the future), so I instead opted to [add a new inline style tag](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209/files#diff-48443fc170100677376b7ee11324494b) to override [a styling rule](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L5149) (on top of removing the 'orange-text' class from individual anchor elements).\n\n* * *\n\nAll of the changes I've made can be viewed through [my (merged) pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209):\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request [layer5io#209](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209): resolved the remainder of issue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)\n\n* * *\n\nI am very fortunate to be so well-supported by the open source communities I have worked with so far, both on-campus and abroad. With their support behind me, I feel equipped to start learning what I need to know to resolve the next two more-difficult issues that lie ahead of me!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: Heating up!","date":"Oct 12th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/90996/hacktoberfestw2.webp 750w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/f5ef2/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1080w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1e91f/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1366w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1918w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5291970802919708}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/90996/hacktoberfestw2.webp 750w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/f5ef2/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1080w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1e91f/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1366w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1918w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5291970802919708}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/hacktoberfest-2019-heating-up"}},{"id":"172f6ae5-8002-5100-a4f7-cba43f99c1be","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIn [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/), I identified three GitHub issues to kick off my participation in Hacktoberfest 2019. Today, I am happy to showcase my resolution of one of those issues, marking my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution!\n\n* * *\n\n#### [Layer5.io](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5)\n\nBefore I continue on, I want to acknowledge the project that I have contributed to. In [an article](/programs/gsod) discussing their participating in the Google Summer of Code 2019 program, [**Layer5**](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5)'s open source community is described cloud native tools for devops engineers. My project was on [service mesh](/resources/service-mesh/service-mesh-fundamentals) helpfully defines a service mesh as \"a dedicated infrastructure layer\" of an application that controls how different parts of that application (\"services\") share data with one another (i.e. 'mesh together').\n\n* * *\n\n### Selecting my first Hacktoberfest issue\n\nAs I mentioned my last post, I came into contact with Layer5 after discovering (through the [Hacktoberfest Issue Finder](https://hacktoberfest-finder.netlify.com/)) its [issue regarding table filtering](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)—and subsequently discovered an unreported styling issue. [![A styling issue with a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's Landscape page.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)\n\nA styling issue affected a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nOf the three GitHub issues I've scoped out, the resolution of this styling issue (i.e. tweaking CSS) represents the simplest of tasks that I have lined up—and an ideal candidate for a first-time Hacktoberfest contribution!\n\nAs far as I could tell, no open issues concerned the styling problem that I discovered. So, as instructed both Layer5's website (and encouraged its extremely-welcoming development team), I opened _my own issue_ - [Enhance landscape categories section wrapping (#191)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191).\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)\n\n### Identifying a solution\n\nTo address this issue, I came up with the idea of realigning the category list items horizontally, transforming the poorly-behaving columns of category 'cards' into rows in a responsive and easily-scalable vertical stack.\n\nImplementating this idea proved quite simple, requiring only [a few added CSS rules](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508), which I first accomplished by tinkering with the live webpage's styling (with the help of the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) browser extension):\n\n\n```css\n.card .card-content li {\n  float: right;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n.card .card-content {\n  border-right: unset;\n  padding: 0 0 5px 0;\n}\n.card .card-content:not(:last-child) {\n  border-bottom-width: 1px;\n  border-bottom-style: dashed;\n  border-bottom-color: var(--main-dark-grey);\n}\n```\n\nThe vertical stack is implemented by the rules in the first selector: list items are floated right and assigned a fixed width, which aligns them neatly. The dashed borders and padding used to separate category lists was also adjusted to accomodate the new design (pictured below):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)\n\nThe above image is one of the [two mockups of the redesign](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508) that I produced for the consideration of the project's developers. As luck would have it, Layer5 project lead [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote) provided [a lightning-quick response](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179), welcoming a pull request to it!\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)\n\n#### Future research area: Materialize CSS\n\nI discovered that the 'cards' comprising the category section are styled using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/). I considered using this framework in my solution, but ultimately decided to opt for a simple, intuitive solution. This framework appears interesting, and would definitely merits research were this a more-involved styling task.\n\n## Implementing the solution\n\nWhile using my browser's developer tools to tinker with styling, I discovered an inline `style` tag that serviced the categories section. I determined that this tag would present the best place to add the styling rules that I wrote (following the coding style of a prior contributor).\n\nFinding the location of this `style` tag (i.e. of the \"Service Mesh Landscape\" page) in the source code was a lot more trouble than I thought it would be. After paging through too many HTML documents, I gave in and used Visual Studio's global search functionality to locate it.\n\n## Testing the solution\n\nAlthough I knew that my styling worked well when loaded from a browser extension, before I could contribute code, I needed to ensure that the styling worked equally-well when loaded inline from an HTML document. Little did I know, at that time, what I would be getting myself into...\n\n#### Ruby, Gems and Jekyll? `rvm`, `bundle` and `make`?\n\nPicking through my ~/.bash\\_history file, here is the sequence of Bash shell commands that I issued (via WSL Ubuntu) in order to execute a local copy of the layer5 website (annotated for your convenience):\n```sh\n## Install dependency packages ##\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\n## Install specific version of Ruby via Ruby Version Manager ##\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rvm\nrvm install \"ruby-2.6.3\" # install specific version of Ruby specified in Layer5's Gemfile\n                         # (Yes, it must be that exact version.)\n\n## Configure RubyGems ##\necho 'export GEM\\_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n## Install Jekyll and dependencies ##\ngem install jekyll bundler\nbundle install           # install dependencies listed in Gemfile\n\n## Execute project! ##\nmake site                # references Layer5's Makefile\n                         # alias for \"bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload\"\n```\n#### Stray thoughts on documentation\n\nReflecting back on the process, a question has stuck with me: how much should projects hold the hands of novice contributors? Setting up the means to run `make site` is not included within Layer5's [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). As such, for the most novice of contributors, like myself (who have never even heard of `make` before), setting up the prerequisite development environment presented a lengthy and piecemeal (albeit ultimately valuable) learning experience.\n\nHow much documentation is too little? Too much? How high should the bar be set for contribution? I suppose it is up to the project's community to decide upon the answers to these questions themselves (and write documentation, accordingly).\n\n## Creating a pull request\n\nAfter successfully testing and fixing the styling on my local fork, I created [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request – [Restyle landscape categories (#192)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192)\n\n...and it got merged! First Hacktoberfest contribution, completed!\n\n## Up next!\n\nI ended [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) by stating that I have yet to gain any experience with makefiles. Well, thanks to my work on Layer5, that is no longer true: I have since used a makefile (to launch a Jekyll executable)! This experience will undoubtedly save me some time with resolving [the Comcast issue I found](https://github.com/Comcast/RestfulHttpsProxy/issues/5)! However, the next Hacktoberfest issue I resolve will be [_the first one I blogged about_](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65).\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: documenting my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution","date":"Oct 2nd, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/25655/hacktoberfest.webp 750w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/d8caf/hacktoberfest.webp 1080w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/bbff9/hacktoberfest.webp 1366w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp 1894w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4736008447729672}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/25655/hacktoberfest.webp 750w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/d8caf/hacktoberfest.webp 1080w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/bbff9/hacktoberfest.webp 1366w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp 1894w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4736008447729672}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/internship-programs/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution"}},{"id":"cac9ddb8-17d6-5815-b6a0-3a849328003b","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport wsldockerstart from \"./wsl-docker-start.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanalogin from \"./wsl-grafana-login.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanaloginsuccess from \"./wsl-grafana-login-success.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanastart from \"./wsl-grafana-start.webp\";\nimport wslk3dstart from \"./wsl-k3d-start.webp\";\nimport wslmesherycomplete from \"./wsl-meshery-complete.webp\";\nimport wslmesherylogin from \"./wsl-meshery-login.webp\";\nimport wslmesheryloginsuccess from \"./wsl-meshery-login-success.webp\";\nimport wslmesherystart from \"./wsl-meshery-start.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nDuring KubeCon EU 2019, I had the chance to discover two new softwares that simply amazed me:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), which is the multi-cluster Kubernetes management plane.\n2. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d), which is used to create a dockerized [k3s](https://k3s.io) server.\n\nAnd, what really appealed to me about both of them is that everything from the installation to the usage was just *simple!*\nAnd cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.\n\n<h4>Environment Setup</h4>\n\nBefore we start having *real* fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery)\n2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n    - Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is also mandatory.\n3. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)\n    - k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.\n4. [WSL2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)\n    - For the (few) ones who know me, my \"OS base\" is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) *(optional)*\n    - Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.\n\n<h4> Nothing is taken for granted </h4>\n\nFor the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won't explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.\n\nThat said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no \"just have to ...\" or \"by simply doing ...\".\n\nIf you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nunixtech) or on the [Layer5 Slack channel](http://slack.layer5.io).\n\n<h4>Meshery Installation</h4>\n\nFor the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:\n\n- Start docker and confirm it's running:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\ndocker version\n```\n\n- Using Docker, install Meshery on your local machine by running the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n<a href={wsldockerstart}>\n    <img src={wsldockerstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wsl-docker-start\" />\n</a>\n\n- Create a new k3d cluster with the <code> WSL2 IP </code>\n\n```bash\nexport mainIP=`hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'`\nk3d list\nk3d create --workers 3 --api-port ${mainIP}:6443\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\nkubectl cluster-info\n```\n\n<a href={wslk3dstart}>\n    <img src={wslk3dstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslk3dstart\" />\n</a>\n<br/>\n- Start Meshery on the newly created cluster\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl system start\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherystart}>\n    <img src={wslmesherystart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherystart\" />\n</a>\n- Once Meshery is fully started, login in your preferred browser using the <code>WSL2 IP</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>\n\n```bash\nexport BROWSER=/mnt/c/Firefox/firefox.exe\n$BROWSER $mainIP:9081 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherylogin}>\n        <img src={wslmesherylogin} alt=\"wslmesherylogin\" />\n</a>\n<a href={wslmesheryloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslmesheryloginsuccess} alt=\"wslmesheryloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### [Optional] More analytics with Grafana\nAs stated above, Meshery can leverage the analytics provided by Grafana. For this blog post, as everything is built from scratch. Here is the setup for a new Grafana dockerized instance.\n\nStart a new Grafana on docker instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-d \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--name=grafana \\\n-e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://$mainIP\" \\\n-e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=MesheryInstance\" \\\ngrafana/grafana\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanastart}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanastart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanastart\" />\n</a>\n\n- Access the new instance with the admin password that you set in the docker environment variable\n```bash\n$BROWSER $mainIP:3000 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanalogin}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanalogin} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanalogin\" />\n</a>\n<br />\n<a href={wslgrafanaloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanaloginsuccess} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanaloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n### An inside look\nWhile everything should run fine, it's always good to have a look at what has been deployed.\n\nIn this case, we are almost exclusively working with Docker and the \"inside look\" should look something like this:\n\n<a href={wslmesherycomplete}>\n    <img src={wslmesherycomplete} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherycomplete\" />\n</a>\n\n#### Conclusion\nAs [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery > k3s (deployed via k3d) > Docker > WSL2 > Windows 10. And he's totally right, still the \"beauty\" here, is that it \"simply works\".\n\nSince the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.\nEven Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.\n\nAnd of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different Kubernetes configurations. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the \"Bonuses\", more fun to come!\n\n<span> > > > <i>Nunix out</i></span>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d","date":"Jul 9th, 2019","author":"Nuno do Carmo","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/getting-started-with-meshery-wsl2-and-k3d"}},{"id":"fbc0a4e6-e2df-5139-835a-843d390eaa13","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport SmiLogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={SmiLogo} alt=\"SMI Logo\"/>\n\nMost began their cloud native journey with their first step being use of containers, and taking a second step, moved into container orchestration as their workloads grew. Now, waves and waves of organizations are considering service meshes as their third significant step in their cloud native journey. As they invest into service meshes as their next layer of key infrastructure, users will continue to look for the same assurances sought from other commonly accepted (standard) interfaces for container runtimes (e.g. CRI), container storage (e.g. CSI), container networking (e.g. CNI) and they will look for a commonly accepted service mesh interface.\n\nAs a prominent supporter of management software for multiple service meshes, Layer5 is pleased to partner with Microsoft in support of the [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io) (SMI). The Service Mesh Interface is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. As such, SMI defines a common standard that can be implemented by a variety of service mesh projects and vendors.\n\nLike standards before SMI, consistent APIs inspire confidence in infrastructure stability, community-managed APIs assuage technology and vendor lock-in concerns, and steward the resounding of core use cases, resulting in streamlining the smaller, but critical-to-users, subset of capabilities offered across the [service mesh landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nMeshery and SMI are aligned on common goals of getting users started quickly, understanding that users want service mesh technology, but have questions as to which service mesh use, how, and when to get started through a common interface. Meshery’s playground capabilities quick provision a variety of service meshes and reduce time to value and time to understanding for those adopting a service mesh.\n\nAs a multi-mesh manager, Meshery, understands that each service mesh has it own strengths. SMI intends to allow for differentiation by service mesh providers, at the same time providing interoperability between service meshes and their surrounding tooling. As a management plane, Meshery enhances networking intelligence in a multi-mesh way, encouraging users to expect more from their infrastructure. Meshery exposes each service mesh’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nSMI’s aim for consistent APIs facilitates Meshery’s same goals, allowing for users and tools to flourish. As SMI unveils today, so does Meshery’s compatibility.

Up to this point, while creating container images, I hadn't paid attention to a particular feature of `docker build`: <i><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/reference/build-checks/\">build checks</a></i>. I had otherwise overlooked warnings and informational notices that were lost among the fray of docker build log lines. I've stopped ignoring them, however. In this post, I'll touch upon a handful of the more common build warnings, delve into the importance of these checks, and explore how and why to address each. But, first...\n\n<BlockquoteAlt\n  style={{ width: \"100%\" }} person=\"Lee Calcote\" quote=\"Build checks are your Dockerfile linter.\" />\n\n###  Why Use Docker Build Checks?\n\nNow, of course we're aware that `docker build` is a bread and butter command (very commonplace), however, if you're like me, you might have overlooked the `--check` flag. Think of build checks as a linter for your Dockerfile, and as it turns out, build checks are a valuable tool for validating your Dockerfile and build options (flags) against established best practices. Build checks help you identify potential issues early on, too, which I've come to appreciate. In fact, whereas am occassionally annoyed by overzealous linting rules, in general, I've turned the corner with lint checks as when you're maintaining large codebases with a couple thousand contributors, it becomes essential to enforce some uniformity and idiomatic coding. \n\nThey analyze your build configuration and provide feedback on potential problems, such as:\n\n* **Inefficiencies:**  Checks can identify unnecessary layers or overly large images, helping you optimize for size and performance.\n* **Security risks:**  They can flag potential security vulnerabilities, like using outdated base images or insecure commands.\n* **Maintainability issues:** Checks can highlight inconsistencies and deviations from best practices, improving the readability and maintainability of your Dockerfiles.\n\n### Under the Hood of Build Checks\n\nIntroduced in Dockerfile 1.8, build checks are integrated into the build process itself. When you invoke a build with the `--check` flag, Docker analyzes your Dockerfile and build options *before* executing any build steps. This pre-emptive analysis allows for early detection of potential issues, saving you time and resources.\n\nDocker employs a rule-based system to perform these checks. Each rule targets a specific aspect of your Dockerfile, such as image size, security practices, or Dockerfile syntax. These rules are continuously updated to reflect evolving best practices and address new vulnerabilities.\n\nAs you familiarize yourself with build checks, you'll notice that they are categorized into three levels, which are pretty self-evident, but worth noting, so that you can prioritize your remediation efforts. These levels are:\n\n* **Errors:**  These are critical issues that prevent the build from completing successfully. Errors must be resolved before you can proceed with the build.\n* **Warnings:**  Warnings indicate potential problems that don't halt the build but should be addressed to ensure best practices.\n* **Info:**  Informational messages provide additional context or suggestions for improving your Dockerfile. While not critical, acting on these messages can enhance your Dockerfile's quality.\n\n## Common Warnings and Remediation\n\nBefore we dive into some common warnings and how to address them, let's review how to run build checks on a Dockerfile.\n#### Running Build Checks\n\nTo run build checks, simply use the `--check` flag with your `docker build` command:\n\n```bash\ndocker build --check .\n```\n\nYes, quite straightforward. This command triggers build checks for the Dockerfile in the current directory. If any issues are detected, Docker will display the corresponding warnings or errors.\n\nNow, we're ready to explore some frequently encountered warnings and how to address them. Here are some of the warnings that I've run into, what they mean, and how to fix them:\n\n### 1. FromAsCasing\n\n\n- **Warning:** `WARN: FromAsCasing: 'as' and 'FROM' keywords' casing do not match`\n- **Explanation:** This warning occurs when the `FROM` and `AS` keywords in a multi-stage build have different casing (e.g., `FROM` and `as`). While Docker allows both uppercase and lowercase, mixing casing can hinder readability. Consistency in casing enhances readability and maintainability, making your Dockerfile easier to understand for both yourself and collaborators.\n- **Remediation:**  Ensure consistent casing for `FROM` and `AS` keywords throughout your Dockerfile.\n\n```docker\n# Incorrect\nFROM ubuntu:latest as builder\n\n# Correct\nFROM ubuntu:latest AS builder\n```\n\n### 2. LatestType\n\n* **Warning:** `WARN: LatestType: 'latest' tag used for base image`\n* **Explanation:** Using the `latest` tag can lead to unpredictable builds since the base image may change unexpectedly. Pinning to specific tags ensures reproducible builds, preventing unexpected behavior due to changes in the base image. This is crucial for production environments where stability is paramount.\n* **Remediation:**  Specify a specific tag for your base image to ensure consistency and reproducibility.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Incorrect\nFROM ubuntu:latest\n\n# Correct\nFROM ubuntu:22.04\n```\n\n### 3. AptGetNoInstallRecommends\n\n* **Warning:** `WARN: AptGetNoInstallRecommends: 'apt-get install' with no ' --no-install-recommends' flag`\n* **Explanation:**  Installing recommended packages can increase image size and potentially introduce unnecessary dependencies. Recommended packages often include extra dependencies that bloat your image size. This can lead to increased storage costs, slower downloads, and potentially longer build times.\n* **Remediation:**  Use the `--no-install-recommends` flag with `apt-get install` to avoid installing recommended packages.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Incorrect\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-name\n\n# Correct\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends package-name\n```\n\n### 4. RunCommandWithNoExecForm\n\n* **Warning:** `WARN: RunCommandWithNoExecForm: 'RUN' command with no 'exec' form`\n* **Explanation:** Using the exec form (`RUN [\"executable\", \"param1\", \"param2\"]`) for RUN commands is generally more efficient and avoids potential issues with shell interpretation. The exec form provides better performance and avoids potential shell injection vulnerabilities by directly executing the command without shell processing.\n* **Remediation:** Use the exec form for `RUN` commands whenever possible.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Incorrect\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-name\n\n# Correct\nRUN [\"apt-get\", \"update\"]\nRUN [\"apt-get\", \"install\", \"-y\", \"--no-install-recommends\", \"package-name\"]\n```\n\n### 5. RedunantAptUpdate\n\n* **Warning:** `WARN: RedundantAptUpdate: 'apt-get update' found in multiple RUN instructions`\n* **Explanation:** Running `apt-get update` multiple times within a Dockerfile is inefficient. Each `apt-get update` fetches package information from repositories. Repeating this unnecessarily consumes bandwidth and increases build time.\n* **Remediation:**  Combine `apt-get update` with the subsequent `apt-get install` command in a single `RUN` instruction.\n\n```dockerfile\n# Incorrect\nRUN apt-get update\nRUN apt-get install -y package-name\n\n# Correct\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y package-name\n```\n\nThese are just the checks that I ran into. See the full list of available checks by running `docker build --help` or visiting the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/build-checks/).\n\n## Beyond the Build Check Basics\n\nNow, that you've gotten started with Dockerfile optimatization, you can further customize build checks to suit your needs. Know that you're not limited to just enabling or disabling all checks, but that Docker offers granular control, allowing you to:\n\n* **Skip specific checks:**  If a particular check isn't relevant to your use case, you can skip it using the `--check=rule1,rule2,!rule3` syntax. This enables `rule1` and `rule2` while skipping `rule3`.\n* **Fail on warnings:** By default, warnings don't halt the build process. However, you can enforce stricter compliance by using the `--fail-on=warn` flag, ensuring any warning triggers a build failure.\n* **Explore experimental checks:**  Push the boundaries with experimental checks by using the `--check=experimental` flag. These checks offer a glimpse into future best practices and can help you stay ahead of the curve.\n\nBuild checks are not just about fixing warnings; they are about proactively adopting best practices. Up your Dockerfile game with these additional tips:\n\n* **Embrace multi-stage builds:**  Leverage multi-stage builds to create smaller, more efficient images by separating build-time dependencies from runtime essentials.\n* **Utilize a `.dockerignore` file:** Exclude unnecessary files from your build context to reduce image size and speed up builds.\n* **Order your instructions strategically:** Place frequently changing instructions towards the end of your Dockerfile to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.\n\nBy understanding the mechanics of build checks and actively addressing the warnings, you can unlock the full potential of Docker and build robust, efficient, and secure containerized applications.\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Docker Build Check Failures","date":"Oct 9th, 2024","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2a7dde65e579f386ecbed3f2fc4606ac/docker-extension-meshery-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2a7dde65e579f386ecbed3f2fc4606ac/ad7cd/docker-extension-meshery-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/2a7dde65e579f386ecbed3f2fc4606ac/ad7cd/docker-extension-meshery-logo.webp 363w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1.0853994490358125}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/2a7dde65e579f386ecbed3f2fc4606ac/docker-extension-meshery-logo.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiwCAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAFQAAQUxQSAMBAAABgGvbtrHn/LHt5Alc2a4yUtl2OrW2bVe2+dtWFTuljd/f9woRMQGg1K1bvB0KKM152EYezgtFGnb4CDfchSKFtzLGW+mOqSwxReDMX5jhLjxuDXK2bFVB0c4Gd4/US8T1NiIIoJ73ZHCJDWxys6oIAb6JdXPYysU296jabqKTm2jXh61sWk40RkEDFrCkPiw5Infp/Vsi6QAAv2Or/lH26pjAqfNNohipZtEkaXZY4c7jL54lyg8OJU+SBdBL50kQvsX8SSQHBS13EsTgXo6VoH0HgApUJACIQlUMAOafKB4MAADqEP3NOYKiJg6JJBuUG86oukoBhAHT57//t0uJWgAAAFZQOCACAQAAEAYAnQEqFAAWAD7RXKZOqCUjIigKqQAaCWwAnTMYL0EzOEYzCUcfGIl3ENai4eFZQu+1MxBrwrAAAP6e2afMPBN+4pGaascUU4u+Q/nINgyrLk2RBNA9vvzhOtWcx2DZE3iPefuoTrIDZcltVH/7R/zVPJLZmhHo6jeqvnraJOwL3nhwxW7mjyuSMBjfIgtbZ8WFXngRTltsvvsMDS5JA9On6QWnBP68Li0bPT0OAJxnEmf3+/qYxHOP+O9KSAEJU2QUNkHP7rG0w9LJx+xRksEQryQ4/yFpjym1b6KAux8wiHfr/5hPUR1pCZgUMmu3K3M4BHbdGETzGS3gItK+SwAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2a7dde65e579f386ecbed3f2fc4606ac/ad7cd/docker-extension-meshery-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/2a7dde65e579f386ecbed3f2fc4606ac/ad7cd/docker-extension-meshery-logo.webp 363w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1.0853994490358125}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/docker/docker-build-check-failures"}},{"id":"de7adc26-cb41-51ca-b5ba-76709f65840e","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport popularProject from \"./number-one-most-popular-project.png\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nThe Layer5 community grows on a daily basis, which means that each day <Link to=\"/community/community-managers\">community managers</Link>, <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</Link>, and other existing <Link to=\"/community/members\">community members</Link> field the question of \"how can I contribute to your project\" any number of times everyday.

Xin is a maintainer of the <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Cloud Native Performance</Link> project. In this interview, we get to know Xin a little better and learn about his journey as an open source project maintainer and with Layer5 community.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Xin, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Xin is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      I’m working around Service Mesh Acceleration in Intel, and noticed the Service Mesh Performance project. So I attended the community meeting — the community is very active and welcoming and they hope for feedback and contribution from me. It’s the main reason that made me stay here and contribute continuously.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Have you worked with any other open source project? How does <Link to=\"/community\">Layer5 community</Link> compare?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Yes, I’ve worked with some open source projects. Layer5 community knows how to cultivate and fulfill the spirit of open source. If you are a newcomer to open source, you can get a big leg up from the Layer5 community.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      What is so fascinating about service meshes? Why are you focused on this technology specifically?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      First, I’m working on Service Mesh Acceleration at Intel. Second, service mesh is a hot area — more and more people and enterprises are trying service mesh in production. Service Mesh is the bridge between developers and infrastructure; how fascinating it is to build something that benefits everyone.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      <Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      I’m focusing on the SMP (Service Mesh Performance) project because it’s closely related to my day job. I also use Meshery to manage our service mesh environment and demonstrate our acceleration efforts. Every project has its own specific goal — I can’t say which one is the “best”.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      What is your favorite Meshery CLI command?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Having worked on and used Meshery’s performance characterization features, I’m biased — I like `mesheryctl perf` the most.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Where do you see Cloud Native Performance, Nighthawk, and Meshery heading?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Meshery has a great vision: to manage **all** cloud and cloud-native technologies. It’s a fantastic idea for infrastructure and platform engineers who are overwhelmed by the explosion of projects.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Do you have any hot tip for working with Service Mesh Performance, Nighthawk, or Meshery that others may not know?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      A very powerful feature is coming: Meshery will externalize <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> as a first-class load generator with full lifecycle management. Nighthawk already supports adaptive load control, and with its plugin system we can feed custom metrics back into Meshery. In the future Meshery will even be able to auto-tune resiliency policies based on performance results. This amount of closed-loop intelligence is extremely exciting.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      Do you have any advice for individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or even maintainers one day?\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Be consistent, take ownership (even of boring tasks), help newcomers, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. The current maintainers have all earned their role through dedication — learn from them and respect their time. High-quality contributions, no matter the size, are what matter most.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewer\">\n      <span>Layer5 Team:</span>\n      In other words, aim for quality over quantity and enjoy the ride!\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"interviewee\">\n      <span>Xin:</span>\n      Exactly. And never forget to have fun while learning and collaborating with this incredibly diverse community.\n    </div>\n\n    <div className=\"note\">\n      <img src={ForkLift} style={{ height: \"100px\", marginBottom: \"1rem\" }} alt=\"Forklift\" />\n      The Meshery project moves at an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like Xin.  \n      **Be like Xin.** Join the <a

{ BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport comparativeCost from \"./comparative-cost-of-observability-signals.png\";\nimport Blockquote from \"../../../../reusecore/Blockquote\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nThe world of software development is embroiled in a silent war – the Observability Arms Race.  On one side, verbose logs, relics of our debugging days, threaten to devour production budgets.  On the other, traces, the Sherlock Holmes of observability, offer targeted insights but come with their own complexities.\n\nAll signals have different ways to be collected/instrumented. They also have different resource costs to obtain, store, and analyze, while providing different ways to observe the same system. Choosing between them, or all of them, is a game of trade-offs like all other tasks in engineering. In the next sections, we’ll help you make this decision by digging deeper into each signal, starting with the most popular ones: metrics, logs and traces, and then the two new possible signals: application profiles and crash dumps.\n\n**The Logpocalypse Looms:**\n\nRemember that single log statement you sprinkled in development?  Imagine it bombarded with millions of hits daily in production.  The cost implications are staggering.  Are we clinging to outdated habits, drowning in a sea of irrelevant data?\n\n<Blockquote quote=\"Log levels area a Band-Aid, not a cure.\" person=\"Lee Calcote\" />\n\nLog levels offer some relief, silencing the noise in production.  But what if that critical error gets buried under an avalanche of info logs?  Is there a risk of sacrificing valuable insights for a false sense of cost control?\n\n**Traces: A Targeted Approach Emerges:**\n\nTraces offer a compelling alternative.  They map a request's journey through your system, meticulously recording events and their connections.  This targeted approach inherently generates less data, making them potentially cost-effective.\n\nTracing offers the ability to granularly track request segments (spans) as the request is processed across various services. It is hard to introduce later, one reason being third party libraries that are used by the application also need to be instrumented. The cost of distributed tracing can be high, and so, most service mesh tracing systems employ various forms of sampling to capture only a certain portion of the observed traces. When traces are sampled performance overhead and storage costs are reduced, but so is your visibility. The rate at which sampling is done is a balance between the frequency by which traces are captured (typically expressed as a percentage in relation to service request volume). \n\n**Figure: Cost vs. Value Spectrum**\n\n<img src={comparativeCost} className=\"image-center-shadow\" style={{width: \"70%\"}} />\n\n_Figure: a comparative spectrum of value provided by and cost of each pillar._\n\nThe figure above presents a visual spectrum that acknowledges that collecting telemetry in production is a compromise between cost in terms of storage and performance (CPU, memory, and request latency) overhead, and the value of information collection, typically in terms of how expressiveness it is or useful it is in solving puzzles of slow or errored responses. \nIt’s argued that metrics provide the highest value for the smallest investment. Given that some service meshes facilitate distributed tracing, an argument that distributed tracing provides the highest value and can be achieved at low investment (relative to the amount of insight provided). Ideally, your instrumentation allows you to dial back the verbosity levels and sampling rate to facilitate control over your overhead costs vs desired observability.\n\n\nWe won't dive into metrics as a signal in this post, but will ackowledge their use and validaty in the converation.  Metrics also represent point in time observations of the state of a system. This differs from logs or traces, which focus on records or information about individual events.\n\n### The Power of Smart Sampling\n\nNot all traces are created equal.  Simple sampling techniques can leave you blindsided.  The key lies in dynamic/adaptive tail sampling – a detective sniffing out the real clues in a crime scene, focusing on the most valuable traces.\n\n**The Power of Smart Sampling with Jaeger**\n\nWe've established that simple, \"dumb\" sampling techniques for traces can leave you blindsided. Imagine a scenario in Jaeger, a popular distributed tracing platform, where every trace has a 10% chance of being captured, regardless of content. Crucial errors with low occurrence might slip through the cracks.\n\nThis is where dynamic/adaptive tail sampling, a champion feature of Jaeger, enters the scene, offering a more intelligent approach. Here's how it works within the Jaeger ecosystem:\n\n* **Jaeger's Collector Takes Center Stage:**  As traces flow into your Jaeger collector, it doesn't make a snap decision about sampling.  Instead, it analyzes key characteristics of each trace using Jaeger's robust sampling framework. This might include:\n    * **Span Duration:**  Did a particular span within the trace take an exceptionally long time, indicating a potential bottleneck in a specific service?\n    * **Error Tags:**  Did any spans within the trace contain error tags, suggesting something went wrong?\n    * **Service Names:**  Was a specific service involved in the trace that's known to be error-prone based on historical data?\n\n* **Prioritizing the Catch:**  Based on analysis, the Jaeger collector assigns a sampling probability to each trace.  Traces with characteristics suggesting valuable insights (e.g., slow spans, errors) will have a higher chance of being captured. On the other hand, common, routine traces might be sampled at a lower rate.\n\n**The Jaeger Detective at Work:**\n\nThink of Jaeger's dynamic/adaptive tail sampling as a detective sifting through a crime scene. They don't blindly collect every span within every trace.  Instead, they prioritize clues based on their potential significance – error tags within a span get captured with a higher probability than a normal database access span in a healthy service. \n\nThis intelligent approach ensures you capture the valuable traces while keeping the cost under control. But even with Jaeger, there are good and bad practices to consider:\n\n* **Bad Practice: Sampling Everything (Jaeger YAML configuration):**\n\n```yaml\n# This configuration captures EVERY trace, defeating the purpose of sampling.\nsampler:\n  type: probabilistic\n  param: 1.0\n```\n\n* **Good Practice: Prioritize Errors (Jaeger YAML configuration):**\n\n```yaml\n# This leverages Jaeger's ability to identify traces with errors.\n\nsampler:\n  type: probabilistic\n  param: 0.1  # Capture 10% of normal traces\n  samplingStrategy:\n    perOperation:  # Define per-operation sampling strategies\n      \"*\": 0.1\n      \"payment-service.processPayment\": 1.0  # Capture all traces for payment-service.processPayment\n```\n\n**Jaeger Tracing Operator: Best Practices**\n\nThe Jaeger Tracing Operator simplifies deploying and managing Jaeger in Kubernetes environments. Here's how to leverage it with best practices:\n\n1.  **Install the Jaeger Operator:**  Follow the official guide to install the Jaeger Operator in your Kubernetes cluster.\n\n2.  **Define Jaeger CRDs with Sampling Strategy:**  Use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) provided by the operator to configure your Jaeger instance. Within the CRD YAML, define the `sampler` section as shown in the good practice example above.\n\n3.  **Tailor Sampling for Specific Services:**  The Jaeger Operator allows granular control over sampling strategies. You can define specific sampling probabilities for individual services within your application landscape. \n\n**Beyond the Basics:**\n\nJaeger's dynamic/adaptive tail sampling offers a robust configuration system. You can define custom sampling strategies based on specific service names, tags, or even regular expressions within your traces. This granular control empowers you to tailor the sampling process to your unique application landscape.\n\n**Jaeger: Ideal, or Not Quite?**\n\nJaeger is a powerful tool for distributed tracing, but it's not a one-size-fits-all solution. Here's a quick reflection:\n\n* **Strengths:** Jaeger excels at cost-effective observability with its smart sampling and ease of use.\n* **Considerations:** While Jaeger offers flexibility, configuration can become complex for intricate setups. Additionally, Jaeger itself requires some infrastructure overhead.\n\n**The Takeaway:**\n\nBy embracing Jaeger's smart sampling techniques and leveraging the Jaeger Tracing Operator for best-practice deployments, you can move beyond the reactive \"log everything\" mentality and enter a new era of cost-conscious, insightful monitoring. Remember, the ideal tool depends on your specific needs. Explore your options – Jaeger might be your perfect partner, or it might be the first step on your journey to finding the ideal distributed tracing solution for you. \n\n**The Future of Observability Beckons:**\n\nThe future of observability isn't about logs versus traces.  It's about embracing a proactive approach.  **It's time to move beyond the reactive \"log everything\" mentality.**  By adopting smarter practices, we can create a future where observability doesn't break the bank.  Let's ditch the cost-prohibitive logpocalypse and unlock the power of targeted, insightful monitoring. The choice is clear. \n\n </BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Observability Arms Race","date":"May 31st, 2024","author":"Lee

captivated the tech world for years. But is this a badge of honor for a select few, or a recruiting pipe dream? Let's dissect the concept to see if it holds water.\n\nOn the one hand, there's no denying vast skill gaps exist. Some engineers possess an uncanny ability to solve problems, architect elegant systems, and write clean, efficient code. Their deep understanding and relentless focus translate to impressive results.  However, is this a tenfold difference?  \n\nHere's where skepticism creeps in. The \"10x\" is a nebulous term.  Metrics for programmer performance are complex.  Lines of code churned? Bug fixes closed?  These don't capture the entire picture.  A single line of genius can be worth weeks of rote coding. \n\nFurthermore, the myth often overlooks the power of teamwork.  A talented engineer paired with a brilliant communicator can achieve far more than the sum of their parts.  A supportive team environment that fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing can significantly elevate everyone's performance. \n\nSo, is the 10x engineer a myth? Not entirely.  There are undoubtedly exceptional engineers who deliver remarkable results. But it's likely a spectrum, not a binary. Focusing on building strong, well-rounded teams that leverage individual strengths and create a space for open communication might be a more fruitful approach than chasing the elusive 10x rockstar. \n\nHere's what we can learn:\n\n* **Celebrate exceptional skills:** Recognize and reward engineers who consistently deliver high-quality work.\n* **Focus on team dynamics:** Foster an environment of collaboration and knowledge sharing to elevate everyone's game. \n* **Beware the myth:** Don't get caught up in the idea of a single superstar solving all your problems. \n\nBy creating a culture of continuous learning and collaboration, you might not find a 10x engineer, but you might just build a 10x team. \n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Mythical 10x Engineer","date":"May 8th, 2024","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADQAAQUxQSDoAAAABT2Akgtr0PYoGOBx6uRYR8akw7KCathXrK4cUQgghgKMSQwoBz3sAIvo/ATXWHtsnfMK2xIQDJIAAVlA4IK4AAACQBACdASoUAA4APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoHgd56oCA4aMdhJR4QGY9gA/qofayMU/lgReuEpKR39SxNWVbJzhOyp/GftzgE+djIyBXzel3U4ctaaAvjoePFJl/BFsnQznl55aHlNXI6A9phW9cnhsl1a49TBbJgIRgv7j0QKJOOqGZrI4rwu9XFJ9Cv7pFLOf4xjQ4FqpIjbWC61zymVn+kOKIlchLix4AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/4b14f/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","srcSet":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/f03b4/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 750w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/3cf39/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1080w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/4b14f/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1193w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6764459346186085}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRg4BAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADQAAQUxQSDoAAAABT2Akgtr0PYoGOBx6uRYR8akw7KCathXrK4cUQgghgKMSQwoBz3sAIvo/ATXWHtsnfMK2xIQDJIAAVlA4IK4AAACQBACdASoUAA4APtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoHgd56oCA4aMdhJR4QGY9gA/qofayMU/lgReuEpKR39SxNWVbJzhOyp/GftzgE+djIyBXzel3U4ctaaAvjoePFJl/BFsnQznl55aHlNXI6A9phW9cnhsl1a49TBbJgIRgv7j0QKJOOqGZrI4rwu9XFJ9Cv7pFLOf4xjQ4FqpIjbWC61zymVn+kOKIlchLix4AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/4b14f/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp","srcSet":"/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/f03b4/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 750w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/3cf39/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1080w,\n/static/1efbfd4d81b7b6d2b7b6eea941f66aeb/4b14f/layer5-five-mascot-means-business.webp 1193w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6764459346186085}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/the-mythical-10x-engineer"}},{"id":"c7d6ad99-b105-58c2-b6b9-3878b0d3e58a","body":"\nimport { BlogWrapper } from \"../../Blog.style.js\";\nimport { Link } from \"gatsby\";\nimport Button from \"../../../../reusecore/Button\";\nimport DockerLogo from \"../../../../assets/images/partners/docker.svg\";\nimport dockercompose_logo from \"../../../../assets/images/dockercompose-logo/dockercompose-logo.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<div className=\"intro\">\nExperience the power and ease of the Docker Meshery Extension.

Models uniformly wrap each component with a layer of metadata therein standardizing all entities (infrasturcture or otherwise) under a common interface much in the same way that the Industrial Revolution offered consistency of parts and interchangability of machinery, Meshery Components become fundamental building blocks. Components are like standard Lego bricks, window pieces, wheels that all snap together - or don't - depending upon way in which they relate to one another.\nAs versioned and portable pacakges, Models provide a structured, reusable, and extensible way to represent infrastructure components and their relationships, going beyond just code. This enables a more flexible and adaptable approach to modeling complex systems. are powerful Relationships and policies. contain Components cannot be directly used to build something complete on their own, but are standardized and reused across different Lego sets (instructions).\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Definition:</strong>&nbsp;Building blocks for infrastructure definition.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Focus:</strong>&nbsp;Describe how to manage specific infrastructure types and their interactions.<img data-file-id=\"2445161\" height=\"223\" src={FiveLegos} style={{ border: \"0px\", width: \"300px\", height: \"223px\", margin: \"0px\", boxShadow: \"none\" }} width=\"300\" className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" /></li>\n\t<li><strong>Content:</strong>&nbsp;Define properties, capabilities, and relationships for infrastructure components.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Usability:</strong>&nbsp;Not directly deployable, but used as building blocks within Designs.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Sharing:</strong>&nbsp;Can be packaged and shared for others to use in their Designs.</li>\n</ul>\n\nMeshery Models are like the individual Lego bricks - they define the building blocks for infrastructure with specific characteristics.\n<h3 style={{ marginTop: \"1.2rem\" }}><strong>Meshery Designs (similar to Lego instructions)</strong></h3>\n\nMeshery Designs provide a collaborative blueprint for building a specific model using Lego bricks (Meshery Models).

We hope you are as excited as we are about all the fantastic things we will learn.\n\nZack and Nic are here in Paris representing TAG Network; today at 2:30. They have a lightning talk, and every afternoon, the TAG Network booth will be open for business!\n\n\nWe're excited to connect with you in person at KubeCon EU! You can find us at kiosk **PP19-A**, located in the **Solutions Showcase | Level 7.2 | Hall 7.2 | Project Pavilion**.\n\nAt the booth, we'll be showcasing demos of our two newest projects:\n\n* **Applying for Sandbox Status:** Learn how to easily apply for Sandbox status for your innovative cloud-native networking project.\n* **ConnectRPC:** Discover a revolutionary new approach to service mesh interoperability with ConnectRPC.\n* **KubeSlice:** Dive into the world of network slicing with KubeSlice, designed for optimal network resource utilization.\n\n<div style={{ display: \"flex\", alignItems: \"center\" }}>\n<h2> Don't forget to catch our lightning talk today at 2:30! </h2>\n<img src={Booth} width=\"400\" />\n</div>\n\n<p />\n\nWhether you're interested in these projects, have questions about the TAG Network, or simply want to chat about cloud-native networking, we'd love to see you! Drop by our booth for a coffee and a conversation – we look forward to meeting you!\n\n\n## Building a Strong Foundation: The TAG Network Mission\n\nThe TAG Network, led by Lee Calcote (Layer5), Nic Jackson (HashiCorp), Zack Butcher (Tetrate), and technical lead Zhonghu Xu (Huawei), is dedicated to empowering the cloud native community. Their mission is fourfold:\n\n* **Clarity and Education:** Providing developers and operators with the knowledge and guidance they need to navigate cloud native networking.\n* **Collaboration and Integration:** Fostering collaboration between network projects and other CNCF initiatives for a unified ecosystem.\n* **Project Growth and Adoption:** Supporting the development and widespread adoption of promising network projects within the CNCF landscape.\n* **Neutral Stewardship:** Ensuring a fair and open environment for innovation in cloud native networking.\n\n## A Look Back: Tracking Progress Through KubeCon Events\n\nThe TAG Network and Service Mesh WG have a strong presence at KubeCon events, showcasing the evolution of cloud native networking:\n\n* **KubeCon NA 2019:** This marked the introduction of foundational projects like CNI (Container Network Interface), CoreDNS, Envoy, and Linkerd, laying the groundwork for future advancements.\n* **KubeCon Throughout 2020 & 2021:** The focus shifted towards service mesh adoption, with projects like BFE, Istio, SMI (Service Mesh Interface), and Meshery taking center stage, empowering developers to manage complex microservices architectures.\n* **Recent KubeCon Events:** The latest gatherings highlighted cutting-edge projects like GetNighthawk (performance analysis), KubeSlice (network slicing), and Connect (service mesh interoperability), demonstrating the continuous push for innovation.\n\n## Unveiling Service Mesh Patterns: Reusability Meets Best Practices\n\nThe Service Mesh WG champions the concept of service mesh patterns, a collection of reusable architectural building blocks designed for:\n\n* **End-User Focus:** Explained in clear language, these patterns are independent of specific service meshes, making them easy to understand and implement.\n* **Flexibility:** While core functionality remains consistent, users can leverage features specific to their chosen service mesh for even greater control.\n* **Reusability:** Patterns are designed to be easily copied, modified, and combined to create complex solutions tailored to your specific needs.\n* **Best Practices Integration:** Each pattern incorporates recommended practices for optimal network design, ensuring a solid foundation for your cloud native applications.\n\nExplore the extensive service mesh pattern library at [https://meshery.io/catalog](https://meshery.io/catalog) to discover a treasure trove of reusable solutions for your cloud native network.\n\n<img src={Catalog} />\n<p/>\n\n## Nighthawk Takes Flight: Distributed Performance Analysis\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance initiative tackles the challenge of accurately measuring service mesh performance under load. Enter Nighthawk, a distributed performance analysis tool that empowers you to:\n\n* Generate realistic load scenarios that mimic real-world traffic patterns for a more accurate picture of your network's behavior.\n* Gain valuable insights into system behavior under pressure, allowing you to make informed decisions about configuration and optimization.\n* Compare performance across different service mesh deployments and configurations to identify the best fit for your specific needs.\n\n<img src={NighthawkSlide} />\n<p/>\n\n## Standardization Efforts: MeshMark and the SMP Spec\n\nThe CNCF TAG Network actively promotes standardization within the cloud native networking space. Two key initiatives are:\n\n #### **MeshMark:** \n <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/meshmark\">MeshMark</a> serves as a performance index gauging the significance and overhead within your cloud native ecosystem.

Buf is one of those projects. This post\n\tpresents an overview of Buf.\n</div>\n\n## What is Buf?\n\nA tool to make Protobuf reliable and easy to use for service owners and clients, while keeping it the obvious choice on the technical merits.\nOur organization should not have to reinvent the wheel to create, maintain, and consume Protobuf APIs efficiently and effectively. It will handle our Protobuf management strategy for us, so we can focus on what matters.\n\n<div className=\"fact\">\n\tLearn more about Buf Protocol, visit\n\t<a href=\"https://buf.build\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n\t\t{\" \"}\n\t\tBuf Protocol{\" \"}\n\t</a>\n\tor their documentation at\n\t<a href=\"https://docs.buf.build/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\n\t\t{\" \"}\n\t\tBuf Protocol Docs{\" \"}\n\t</a>\n</div>\n\n<img className=\"problem-image\" src={Problems} />\n\n## Features\n\n- Automatic file discovery.\n- Selectable configuration - 40 lint checkers and 54 breaking checkers\n- Selectable error output - `file:line:col:message`\n- Check anything from anywhere - proto files, tar, git, pre-built images or file descriptors.\n- [Speed](https://docs.buf.build/tour-8/) - Its internal compiler is super fast (approx. 4x then Protoc)\n- Can use buf as a protoc plugin instead of using it as a standalone tool.\n\n## Buf CLI\n\nBuf attempts to simplify your Protocol Buffers workflow using the Buf CLI and protoc plugins. The Buf CLI currently provides:\n\n- A linter that enforces good API design choices and structure.\n- A breaking change detector that enforces compatibility at the source code level or wire level.\n- A generator that invokes your protoc plugins based on a configurable template. A protoc replacement that uses Buf's newly-developed high performance Protobuf compiler.\n- A configurable file builder that produces Images, our extension of FileDescriptorSets.\n\n## Comparison Between Protobuf and Buf\n\nLayer5 projects currently use protoc as the tool for building their protobuf defintions. The following are some considerations made while determining whether to use Buf.\n\n- Protobuf is not as widely adopted as JSON.\n- API Structure\n  - No standards enforcement\n  - Inconsistency can arise across an organization's Protobuf APIs,\n  - Design decisions can be made that can affect your API's future iterability.\n- Backward Compatibility\n- Stub distribution\n- Tooling\n\nBuf aims to solve the above problems and it's long-term goal is to enable schema-driven development: A future where APIs are defined consistently, in a way that service owners and us can depend on\n\n## Roadmap to Adopting Buf\n\nIn consideration of the use of Buf, we would adopt it in phases, starting with the following ares of integration.\n\n- **API Structure Enforcements**\n\n  - Linter solves this issue by enforcing standards.\n  - Also, we don’t need to use Buf as a standalone tool we can just use linter as plugins.\n\n- **Backward Compatibility**\n  - It will check for different things that can cause breaking change.\n  - For example, type change.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n\tIf these topics excite you and you want to explore more\n\t<a href=\"/resources\"> cloud native technolgies </a>, come and say \"Hi\" on the community{\" \"}\n\t<a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\"> Slack </a> and you are sure to be warmly welcomed.{\" \"}\n\t<span>😀</span>\n</div>\n\n</BufProtocol>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Rethinking Protocol Buffers with Buf","date":"May 24th, 2021","author":"Adithya Krishna","thumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/buf-protocol.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJQBOgA+Tk8aehcycAAP7ATvlxq/O19EhA9XrL+2Tj+Q03SbYzgyfckaPxQws5+ikk5FoYgfquExjejLHTZGOL/rxz2A413CEfQgAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/b9516/buf-protocol.webp 750w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a327/buf-protocol.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a401/buf-protocol.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5619791666666667}}},"darkthumbnail":{"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/buf-protocol.webp","childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJQBOgA+Tk8aehcycAAP7ATvlxq/O19EhA9XrL+2Tj+Q03SbYzgyfckaPxQws5+ikk5FoYgfquExjejLHTZGOL/rxz2A413CEfQgAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/b9516/buf-protocol.webp 750w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a327/buf-protocol.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a401/buf-protocol.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5619791666666667}}}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/cloud-native/rethinking-protocol-buffers-with-buf"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1485533831","4047814605","408154852","4152005505"],"slicesMap":{},"matchPath":"/blog"}
