Offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management, &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; enables the confident operation of any service mesh and their workloads. Built for the world of many service meshes, Meshery interoperates with ten different service meshes embracing their differentiated features. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Service Mesh Management Plane &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re on a mission to see that organizations are successful in their operation of the world’s next layer of cloud native infrastructure: service meshes”, said Layer5 founder and CEO, Lee Calcote. “Through Meshery’s management of powerful, service mesh data planes, users can expect more from their infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/MeshMap-290996214ec89d9d914c4ebfb761cf81.png&quot; alt=&quot;Layer5 MeshMap&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meshery is the perfect tool for ensuring that your service mesh applications are optimally configured and performing well; it also gives you a fantastic visual insight into what can be a large amount of textual configuration.&amp;quot;, said Nic Jackson, Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery provides: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Performance Management&lt;/i&gt; - for workloads on and off of service meshes and inside and outside of Kubernetes clusters. .&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Configuration Management&lt;/i&gt; - with deployment of established usage patterns and analysis against configuration best practices; integration of Open Application Model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lifecycle Management&lt;/i&gt; - for service mesh provisioning and workload onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Intelligence Management&lt;/i&gt; - for dynamic configuration and deployment of WebAssembly filters for Envoy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interoperation and federation&lt;/i&gt; - by managing multiple service meshes concurrently.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;60+ best practice deployment templates are actively being captured in the &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Patterns book&lt;/a&gt;, all of which will be deployable using Meshery. With 20+ service meshes available today, the &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-landscape&quot;&gt;service mesh landscape&lt;/a&gt; offers some perspective as to why Meshery supports 10 different service meshes: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;AWS App Mesh &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Citrix Service Mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HashiCorp Consul &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Istio &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kuma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Linkerd&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Network Service Mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NGINX Service Mesh &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Open Service Mesh &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traefik Mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery and Service Mesh Standards &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery is the canonical implementation of &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance (SMP)&lt;/a&gt; and the conformance tool of &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface (SMI)&lt;/a&gt; - two service mesh specifications both hosted by the CNCF. Meshery implements and validates these specifications so that users can confidently operate their service mesh infrastructure, knowing their service mesh upholds industry standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Layer5 has been instrumental in helping us understand the patterns, best practices, and strategies in our approach to the service mesh ecosystem. Meshery has simplified the process of configuring and operating meshes. Meshery&amp;#x27;s service mesh neutrality, open source governance, and defining of industry standards like SMP, SMI, and now service mesh patterns  will ensure that Meshery helps any organization adopt meshes with utmost clarity curated to their needs&amp;quot;, said Yogi Porla, Customer Success Manager at HPE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/configuration-management-0e387f3c696e0e771fc978a83f3735d7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Meshery-Configuration-Management&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Extensible Service Mesh Manager &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not just a service mesh manager, Meshery comprises a set of microservices each one fitted with extension points. Users and integrators may extend Meshery by taking advantage of designated extension points. “With one of the world’s largest enterprise information technology companies, leveraging Meshery as an extensible platform,” said said Layer5 founder and CEO Lee Calcote, “maintainers have spent a lot of time ensuring that extension points allow a variety of plugins and are available through Meshery’s architecture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CNCF Hosts Meshery &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Donation of Meshery to the CNCF has been the goal from the genesis of the project,” said Lee Calcote, chair of the CNCF’s Technical Advisory Group for Networking. “The community around Meshery is what has made it the success that it is.” The CNCF’s hosting of Meshery further enables existing participation of 300+ contributors from Layer5, Red Hat, VMware, HashiCorp, Cisco, Rackspace, Citrix, Instabase, Microsoft, OpenGov, Computas AS, Rill Data, Quantex, Lumina Networks, Asteria Aerospace and others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery Website &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mesheryio&quot;&gt;Meshery Twitter &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/meshery/&quot;&gt;Meshery LinkedIn &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/subscribe&quot;&gt;Community Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Discussion Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Layer5&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 offers cloud native application management by harnessing the unique position service meshes have in changing how developers write applications, how operators run modern infrastructure and how product owners manage their service offerings.

Your management plane might offer deep insights into the performance of your applications and to the performance of your infrastructure or might deliver a  change in management framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,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&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;meshery-logo&quot; height=&quot;35rem&quot; width=&quot;35rem&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom:5px;padding-top:auto&quot;/&gt; Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/mesh-manager-792b35795ec05b6e2879f29f70418901.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-left&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;mesh-manager&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; manages the lifecycle of service meshes. Meshery does workload management, helps you onboard or offboard your applications onto the mesh. It also lets you do performance management. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/meshsync&quot;&gt;MeshSync&lt;/a&gt;, a custom controller within &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery/meshery-operator&quot;&gt;Meshery operator&lt;/a&gt;, performs discovery of existing service meshes and deep fingerprinting of the specific functions that version of your service mesh is capable of performing. Through MeshSync, Meshery supports brownfield deployments of your service meshes (Meshery discovers your existing service mesh deployment that is already running inside your cluster(s) whether those service meshes were deployed by Meshery or not) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to facilitate such a deep level of understanding of each type of service mesh, &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; has adapters that are specific to each service mesh (given that each service mesh has its own set of features). Consequently, in order to leverage the maximum functionality of each service mesh, Meshery has separate, dedicated adapter for each of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/getting-started/overview#meshery-is-for-any-service-mesh&quot;&gt;supported service meshes&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;table-1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Service Mesh&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;Status&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Consul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/istio&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Istio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/kuma&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Kuma&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/linkerd&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Linkerd&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/nsm&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Network Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/osm&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/traefik-mesh&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Traefik Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/cpx&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;beta&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/nginx-sm&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for NGINX Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;beta&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/app-mesh&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for App Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/tanzu-sm&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Tanzu Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;status&quot;&gt;alpha&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; also lets you integrate your Prometheus and Grafana add-ons so you can import your existing Grafana dashboards to Meshery. When you first start Meshery, we also have a configuration wizard, which basically walks you through the entire setup to get Meshery up and running. By the end of this, it will make sure that you have Meshery running on your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-deployment-57963028cbf4a5891af77ec4aad0a4e3.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-right&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;meshery-deployment&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want a more finer configuration, you can configure your environment through settings and you can configure service meshes, and you can configure the metrics, you can define your performance tests to be reused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For configuration management, &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; will analyze your runtime environment for certain service meshes and tell you if you&amp;#x27;re doing things right or not. What you can do is you can upload your applications directly into Meshery, edit them in the Meshery UI itself and actually apply these applications or onboard these applications on your service

alt=&quot;Meshery-features&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery/meshery-operator&quot;&gt;Meshery operator&lt;/a&gt; is a custom controller called MeshSync. MeshSync helps keep Meshery apprised of the various changes that are going on to the service meshes and various changes that are happening within Kubernetes itself. In this way Meshery supports not only greenfield deployments like deploying service meshes itself, it also supports connecting to existing service mesh deployments, that is, brownfield deployment. So it will discover your existing deployments as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#x27;s an extensible concept in Meshery called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers&quot;&gt;provider&lt;/a&gt;. Providers can typically offer a layer of persistence so to the extent that users are running performance tests intensely or to the extent that users want to have a particular type of directory integrated to bring their own identity to Meshery and have a multi-user experience. The other area of extensibility is the notion that Meshery has a couple of APIs both – rest API and graphql API. It comes with a command-line interface as well as a user interface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Layer5 MeshMap&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another capability of Meshery that is going to be released in the upcoming version is visually configuring your service mesh using MeshMap. You can add filters, applications as well as make other configurations visually here and you can export it as patterns to make it reusable quite easily. It automatically figures out the sample application we have deployed, then generates a visual representation.

pattern is capable of describing the deployment of any of the meshes that Meshery supports as well as the configuration of the mesh. It also notes ongoing behavior so if you wanted to run a canary you can describe that in a pattern. So, patterns are like a template, they&amp;#x27;re customizable and ingestible into Meshery itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/service-mesh-patterns-d7da7c3a86ace66fe44dc28cf0e09487.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-right&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Service-Mesh-Patterns&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery will take action based on what you&amp;#x27;ve described in the pattern, things like generating or running a performance test, generating load, and then doing statistical analysis on that set of results. In the future, if you want to deploy a web assembly filter, you can describe that in a pattern as well and have Meshery apply it. The patterns are service mesh agnostic, they&amp;#x27;re reusable and the initial set of them is being stored in a public-facing repository. There are almost 60 patterns that have been identified. Ultimately, it will allow you to ingest these and measure then orchestrate and apply them to your infrastructure. You can also use Meshery to visually represent them and to visually design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,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&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; alt=&quot;nighthawk-logo&quot; height=&quot;35rem&quot; width=&quot;35rem&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom:5px;padding-top:auto&quot;/&gt; Nighthawk&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a project called &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/nighthawk&quot;&gt;Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt; that helps advance the existing integration of nighthawk and Meshery. Nighthawk is a load generator that is an envoy project. It&amp;#x27;s written in c plus plus and has a couple of intriguing capabilities that are the ongoing study within Nighthawk. There is an ongoing effort to take advantage of nighthawk’s adaptive load controllers, add a couple of those in and expose them through Meshery to let people recursively evaluate what is ultimately an optimal configuration in your environment and the service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/nighthawk-9d758a07ae2f38201ed6c33450b42560.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-right&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;Nighthawk&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you consider that you&amp;#x27;ve got a certain SLO or a certain minimum latency requirement that you need to stick to that but you also want to at the same time maximize resiliency characteristics of your deployment, that can be a difficult thing to figure out particularly if any of your infrastructure changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;if you add another node to your environment, your clusters,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if you upgrade your service mesh,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if you change the configuration of your service mesh,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;if you add another service to your set of workloads that you&amp;#x27;re running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these factors change, so does the ability to run optimization routines. To help you identify the optimal configuration of your mesh but in accordance with your own constraints is again the study of &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/nighthawk&quot;&gt;Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Check out the CNCF On-Demand Webinar: &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; - The Service Mesh Manager to learn more!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;iframe-container&quot;&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;215&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/mU8qHUGYsk8&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meshery Workshop at CCOSS 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

In this talk, he walked through service mesh specifications and why they matter in your deployment. How many service mesh specifications do you know? He went through all of them. So, no worries if you&amp;#x27;re unfamiliar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Specifications:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/abstractions-8e32fa13a33f818f6ce41c6e125b2b95.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;abstractions&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. The Service Mesh Interface (SMI), the Service Mesh Performance (SMP), and Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) are three open specifications solving the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service meshes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn what makes each of them unique and why they are much needed. See each of these three specifications in action as we use Meshery, the open-source service mesh management plane to demonstrate the value and functionality of each service mesh abstraction, and the adherence of these specifications by Istio, Linkerd, Consul and other popular service meshes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud native Journey to service meshes:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/cloud-native-journey-fbbb98c7b17efdd1048ba2497229a8f3.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-right&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;journey-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advent of cloud native was the popularization of containers. Thank you Docker! From there, containers took off like wildfire. Turns out you need an orchestrator to wrangle that sprawl. We saw a number of orchestrators come and we still have a number of orchestrators around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service meshes have become a hot topic in the last few years. They still continue to be, rightfully so, a very powerful piece of technology. “A lot of the power is yet to come from my perspective. For my part, I believe that there is a tomorrow in which data plane intelligence really matters. And matters about how people write cloud native applications.”, Lee emphasized. Not everyone quite understands the capabilities of meshes as they are promoted and spoken about today. So come along into the journey of service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of service meshes out there. One of the community projects is to track the landscape of all of the meshes there are. There’s a lot to say about each of them, their architecture, and their working. Why are they made? Who are they focused on? What do they do? When did they come about? Why are some of them not here anymore? Why are we still seeing new ones? A lot of things to go through. You might be interested in any number of the details that the landscape tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Be Aware, It&amp;#x27;s Meshy Out There!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Interface&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/SMI-demo-0c54dc10e863de6f3eec33bda6696ef3.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;smi-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Its goal and genesis were born inside of Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Being a specification that is native to Kubernetes, its focus is on lowest common denominator functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The focus on bringing forth APIs that highlight and reinforce the most common use cases that service meshes are being used for currently&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leaves space and provides extensibility room for additional APIs to address other service mesh functionality as more people adopt and make use cases well known.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are seven service meshes that claim compatibility with SMI. There&amp;#x27;s been a community effort, open-source effort to create service mesh conformance tests to assert whether or not a given service mesh is compatible with SMI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; In order to facilitate those types of tests, you need to have a tool to provision a sample application on those services which will generate load and test whether traffic splitting behaves as expected or works with that service mesh implementation properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then you need to be able to collect the results, guarantee the provenance of those results and publish them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; As a community, we turned to Meshery as the tool to implement &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance&quot;&gt;SMI conformance&lt;/a&gt; and we have been working with the individual service meshes to validate their conformance. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meshery&lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; We work on an open-source project called &lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Meshery, the service mesh management plane, is the canonical implementation of the service mesh performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The management planes can do a number of things to help bridge the divide between other back-end systems and service meshes. They also help performance management, configuration management, making sure you are following best practices in your implementations by taking common patterns and applying them to your environment &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s take a moment to demo what it looks like to validate conformance in SMI using Meshery.&lt;img src=&quot;static/Graph1-922f70168e5eac45ea8da896ca6e827d.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; We need to spin up Meshery locally&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; We use mesheryctl as the command line interface to work with Meshery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; We can interact with a number of different service mesh. The service mesh we’re going to work with today is an Open service mesh (one of those 7 that is compatible with SMI). Let’s put it to the test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; We&amp;#x27;ll initiate &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance&quot;&gt;SMI conformance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These tests go and do assertions across these different specifications. We’re looking at traffic access, traffic splitting, traffic specification. Meshery then collects these results and will eventually be publishing them in combination with the SMI project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/SMP-159eb977925dc661534a3bd22fc7ca80.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-right&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;smp-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focused on describing and capturing the performance of a service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The overhead of the value is another way of looking at it and characterizing it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trying to characterize the performance of the infrastructure of a service mesh can be really difficult.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Considering the number of variables that you would have to track, how difficult it can be to have repeatable tests, and benchmark your environment, to track your history based on your environment, compare performance between other meshes people need.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SMP creates a standard way of capturing the performance of the mesh to help with these issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#x27;s also the way in which you&amp;#x27;re configuring your control plan of your service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might be using a client library to do some service mesh functionality. Maybe you&amp;#x27;re using those in combination with the service mesh. What costs more? What&amp;#x27;s more efficient? What&amp;#x27;s more powerful? Maybe you&amp;#x27;re using web assembly and filters there.
These are all open questions that &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-performance&quot;&gt;SMP&lt;/a&gt; assists in answering in your environment. You’d be surprised by some of the results of some tests that we have done and that the community has done in combination with a couple of universities and graduate students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance Test&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstration of the implementation of service mesh Performance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/flowchart-fc20a3de23738977db7ad02b1e8a79fc.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;flowchart&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; On the terminal, we have a local deployment of Meshery running. You can also deploy on Kubernetes as well as the vendor Kubernetes platforms like AKS, EKS and GCP or you can use a dockerized container to run Meshery. You can also have your Kubernetes on Docker desktop.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have the Open service mesh deployed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; The Meshery UI is exposed at 9081 port. This is the UI which is used to instantiate a Load test.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; Over here you can see we have 3 load generators fortio, wrk2, nighthawk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; All of these load generators have their own set of attributes which they record correctly and each of its attributes have their own significance. We begin with fortio.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Graph2-fbd2d2bd1413e8d800b88af3d1a9419c.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-right&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; alt=&quot;graph&quot;/&gt;&lt;li&gt; You can actually download the test results or you can just browse into the Results Tab and see all of the tests which you have run until now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next, we used nighthawk to generate the load and benchmark the service for the same. Nighthawk is a load generator which is maintained by the Envoy community and is relatively new. It still hasn&amp;#x27;t got its 1.0 release but right now Nighthawk has sufficient features to compete with different generators which are still in the play. It can generate a gRPC service on its own and it has some more attributes which you can expose using their CLI tools.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt; You can also see that Meshery has the capability to search your environment, see what specifications are being used and what&amp;#x27;s the load on your Kubernetes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jump into the results Tab and see how we compare with these results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can click on the download. You will see that a yaml gets downloaded in which you can browse and see that the start time, load time, the performance latencies, the metrics are being captured.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hamlet or Multi-vendor Service Mesh Interoperation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Hamlet-3ac616c9f16b847f7787694efb6a5719.png&quot; class=&quot;slides-left&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;hamlet-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focus on service mesh federation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Specifies a set of API standards for enabling service mesh federation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hamlet takes on a client-server architecture in which resources and services of one service mesh are discovered, registered and using a common format, information about them is exchanged between different service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rules around authentication and authorization rules around which Services get exposed and to whom and who can communicate with them and whether or not they can do it securely. These are things that Hamlet addresses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The specification currently consists of two APIs:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Federated Resource Discovery API&lt;/strong&gt;: API to authenticate and securely distribute resources between federated service meshes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Federated Service Discovery API&lt;/strong&gt;: API to discover, reach, authenticate and securely communicate with federated services.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Part of the real power is the ability to overcome what are likely to be separate administrative domains. The intention here is to marry up connect two disparate service mesh deployments, those deployments might be of the same type, they might be of two different types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to SMI, SMP and Hamlet there has been an emergence of service mesh patterns, by which people are running and operating service meshes. There is a service mesh working group under CNCFs network that is helping identify those patterns of which there&amp;#x27;s a list right now unbeknownst to you. Reach out, join it, help us work through the 60 patterns that are defined right now. 30 of those are going into an &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/service-mesh-books&quot;&gt;O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt; book called &lt;a href=&quot;/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something that isn’t always obvious to folks is this piece of value that people get from a service mesh and actually from the specifications that we were just mentioning. It is the fact that teams are decoupled when you’re running a mesh. Developers get to iterate a bit independently of operators, and so do operators get to make changes to implement infrastructure to the way that applications behave independent of developers in the presence of a mesh.  Both of these teams are significantly empowered. Everybody gets a piece of power when they deploy a mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.: If these topics excite  come and say &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot; on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Slack Channel&lt;/a&gt; and one of us will reach out to you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meet the Fall Interns of 2021]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you\u2019re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad.

I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don't mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty.

They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software. However, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn't do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community.

Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming. I learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications.

I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to. During the course of my internship, I'll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Meshery cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in \"on premise environments\".

We seek out existing contributors who actively reflect the culture and principles of Layer5 to participate in these programs. Here are the Fall of 2021&amp;#x27;s open source interns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hear about their journeys and follow along this fall as they make waves in the Layer5 community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/&quot;&gt;Bariq Nurlis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/bariq-nurlis-eb9c184747cbc99dc4518d353b5a4cb2.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot; alt=&quot;bariq-nurlis&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of contributing to an open source has been on the back of my mind since I enrolled in college back in 2019. Like how most people formulate what and how they will do in the uni, I also came from normalcy. In Singapore, students are aiming to get the best mark in every possible lesson in college as our grades hold a very high importance in the culture. Going back and forth between classes, planning a startup with my peers, volunteering in community clubs, I had a spectacular two years in uni.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, during the last summer break, I started asking myself questions. How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you’re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad. Frankly, the experience wasn’t as good as I expected. Trying to pinch my way in a Google Summer of Code project, I am overwhelmed by numerous people trying to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I thought open source would be like this all the time and it failed me. But then, I took my second chance and joined Layer5. First two weeks, I tried to familiarize myself with the project and joined in the community calls. I remember sharing my screen the first time in the community call, and it was thrilling, my hands can&amp;#x27;t stop shaking. I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don&amp;#x27;t mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty. My thoughts on open source were wrong and I realize that it&amp;#x27;s just a little badness from the overall goodness. Just like Yin Yang. Layer5 has been a supportive community that not only develops your technical side, it nurtures your thinking and reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/rudraksh-pareek&quot;&gt;Rudraksh Pareek&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/rudraksh-pareek-634f69a6faab03bac16aff67c1c98e81.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot; alt=&quot;rudraksh-pareek&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;My journey with open source started when I got into college and fell into the company of some geeky open source evangelists. They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software. However, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn&amp;#x27;t do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community. Whenever I was assigned something, I tried to get my teeth into it as deep as I could before reaching out for help. This helped me learn a lot in a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was so much happening around and I wanted to be a part of it all. So I started attending all the meetings and was able to put my finger into many pies. I soon became better at expressing my thoughts and pretty soon, I developed an interest in CI/CD practices. Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn&amp;#x27;t be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming. I learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications. However, this short span often leads to unjust outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, I believe paying back for what you give to the project is a philosophy in the best faith of everyone in the long term. I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to. During the course of my internship, I&amp;#x27;ll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Meshery cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in &amp;quot;on premise environments&amp;quot;. I&amp;#x27;ll also be collaborating with Ashish Tiwari on integrating a workflow engine with Meshery introducing best practices to be followed by management software. Looking forward to learning and growing during this time while continuing to try my best to help others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/nithish-karthik&quot;&gt; Nithish Karthik &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/nithish-karthik-91a7f9d3aeb4137027c812c7147f4661.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot; alt=&quot;nithish-karthik&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew exactly what I wanted to do ever since my childhood, I wanted to become a programmer. Technology related stuff always intrigued me. But I had to prepare for an entrance examination IITJEE which required enormous dedication and focus to succeed. And so, I had to put my coding dreams on hold till I joined college.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But after I joined college, I felt a sense of freedom within me, in the sense that I could now pursue my passion wholeheartedly. So, the next question was, &amp;quot;Where do I start ?&amp;quot;.
There were a lot of buzz words going around in my college among my peers like CP, Dev, AI and ML etc. I also noticed that people were forcing themselves to do them even when they had no sense of passion or appreciation towards the field. But for me, I always had more joy in the process of doing something than the outcome I get from it. So, I started exploring various fields to find what I loved the most. And I found that I wanted to do development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, I started working on myself. After I got the fundamentals clear, I wanted to have some practical experience to have an idea of how production grade products are being made. So, I worked on a couple of startups to get an exposure to real world development. And I learned a lot during that period. But then, I felt I needed to switch my gear. The idea of open source has always intrigued me the most but my efforts towards open source contribution has not been a success because,&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;I always got intimidated by the size of codebase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn&amp;#x27;t have people guiding me&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of my seniors, who had the best interest in me, encouraged me to get into open source, but I did not take it seriously because I felt intimidated by the idea. I instead thought I would look for some open source internships that way I would have someone mentoring me and that would help me in starting my open source journey. I went through many programs but most of them were closed at that time, except, Meshery in LFX. I thought, this is the only choice I have, let&amp;#x27;s do it, I had nothing to lose. I applied for that program and as a prerequisite, I had to engage with the community. I looked at the community calendar and I saw that there was a newcomer&amp;#x27;s call that day and I attended it. I have never had such a warm welcome in any other communities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that day, I knew that this community is special and I should spend more time with it. I explored the projects and as usual, I felt intimidated, but this time, I had people, wonderful people to help me. I landed my first open source PR, which was a single line style change. But the encouragement and support I got from the community for that was so wonderful . I realised that this community is not just about building best quality products but also about building best quality human beings. It has been a roller coaster ride with Layer5 since then. I got so involved with the process that I had stopped caring about getting that internship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The community has really wonderful people who taught me not only about coding, but also about &amp;quot;How to be&amp;quot;. I am really grateful that I found this community and I hope that everyone has a chance to experience this. I started engaging more in the community projects, especially Meshery UI and always kept coming up with ways to improve it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And fast forward to September 2021, I was told to enroll for the LFX fall term mentorship program and here I am. But, this has never been the goal for me, there is more to me and Layer5 than this internship. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/ashish-tiwari&quot;&gt; Ashish Tiwari &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/ashish-tiwari-f1166ed55c9652b978cdcd43bb0044cb.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot; alt=&quot;ashish-tiwari&quot;/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started my programming career in 2020 when my classmates were bagging internships.I started late because the first two years of my college I never thought that I was a &amp;quot;programming guy&amp;quot; as I always was more of a Physics/Mathematics guy. But in 2020, when the pandemic hit I started programming from &amp;quot;hello world&amp;quot;. I thought I was too late to the party and often felt overwhelmed. After 1 year of getting a taste of everything from data structures, web development, databases and everything in between that a CS undergraduate comes across; I thought to call myself a Backend dev. But I still was dissatisfied and finding something interesting when I came across the concept of containerization which looked magic to me. From there it was a roller coaster ride to kubernetes and then understanding service meshes. I immediately was drawn into the entire CNCF ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After procrastinating for a while, I learnt golang one night, made a side project to feel confident in it and dove back into watching CNCF talks explaining some exciting technology in Golang code.During all this my friend and also my current mentor, Utkarsh helped me through and through.

Extension points allow you to  augment the behavior of Meshery by either adding entirely new capabilities or affecting the behavior of existing functionality, as see in the figure below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;img-center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/meshery-extensibility-25cf2a9d395d81f8b1c3714b5fe26163.svg&quot; style=&quot;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-extensibility-25cf2a9d395d81f8b1c3714b5fe26163.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see in the diagram, Meshery offers many types of extension points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible Service Mesh Adapters&lt;/strong&gt; - bring your own service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible APIs&lt;/strong&gt; - bring your own GraphQL resolvers and expose new, custom endpoints.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible Load Generators&lt;/strong&gt; - Meshery supports three types of load generators, however, you can bring your own and plug it in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensible Providers&lt;/strong&gt; - the v0.5.0 release delivers dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions. Providers are a powerful mechanism for integrating Meshery into your existing tooling and systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of Providers in Meshery: Local - built into Meshery and Remote - implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery. Remote Provider extensibility includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pluggable UI functionality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pluggable Backend functionality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pluggable Authentication and Authorization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Long-Term Persistence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhanced Visualization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Historical Reporting  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about the platform Meshery provides to extend its funcionality by exploring its &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility&quot;&gt;extension points&lt;/a&gt;. If you have or are building your own &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers&quot;&gt;Remote Provider&lt;/a&gt;, let us know!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MeshKit and Meshery Adapter Library&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a service mesh toolkit, MeshKit aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery Adapter Library&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;img-center&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/meshery-adapter-library-a77bdfbda32296a59459619f8ddd0765.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-adapter-library-a77bdfbda32296a59459619f8ddd0765.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center;margin:2rem 4rem&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&quot;/community/member/michael-gfeller&quot;&gt;Maintainer Michael Gfeller&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x27;s blog post &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/meshery/introducing-meshkit-and-the-meshery-adapter-library&quot;&gt;Introduction MeshKit and the Meshery Adapter Library&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the increasing the number and diversity of service meshes supported by Meshery, you might find the list of &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes&quot;&gt;Supported Service Meshes&lt;/a&gt; a helpful, complete list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meshery Operator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;css-float:left;max-width:300px;width:20%;padding:1.25rem&quot; src=&quot;static/meshery-operator-dark-aabaafd987b887ca9b60c9322b365cf6.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;display:block;width:100%&quot;&gt;As a Kubernetes custom controller, Meshery Operator provides a Kubernetes-native approach to interfacing with Meshery. Kubernetes is where service meshes have gotten their initial foothold, and therefore, important that Meshery interface to Kubernetes natively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads outside of the cluster and will grow in this focus over time. While Meshery Operator is Kubernetes only in the v0.5.0 release, Meshery&amp;#x27;s arichitecture makes considerations for different workload and platform types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:flex;width:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center;flex:50%&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/meshery-operator-v0.5.0-95c340376fe3e365a4331622dbe0af1e.png&quot; style=&quot;background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0)&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width:100%&quot; src=&quot;static/meshery-operator-v0.5.0-95c340376fe3e365a4331622dbe0af1e.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul style=&quot;flex:50%&quot;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery Operator is the multi-service mesh operator that runs as a Kubernetes Operator and defines two custom resources: MeshSync and Meshery Broker (NATS)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service mesh discovery, and data streaming via NATS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;MeshSync&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshSync is available as a Kubernetes custom resource that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes cluster, service meshes, and their workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;display:flex&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;max-width:300px;width:20%;padding:1.25rem&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,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&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator and is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/meshsync&quot;&gt;heartbeat of Meshery&lt;/a&gt;, pumping information about service meshes and their workloads throughout Meshery&amp;#x27;s components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshSync helps Meshery mesh with meshes by helping define a service mesh agnostic object model.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; maintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshSync These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Relational Database&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database&quot;&gt;relational database&lt;/a&gt; serves as a repository for MeshSync data, user preferences, and system settings.

This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshery&amp;#x27;s GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshery server runtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meshery Command Line Interface Enhancements&lt;/h2&gt;The beloved `mesheryctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expands the CLI&amp;#x27;s support of multiple Meshery deployments with the `context` command and control over when Meshery auto-updates with the `channel` command.&lt;h3&gt;Managing Multiple Meshery Deployments&lt;/h3&gt;Introduced in this release is the meshconfig - a configuration file that describes Meshery deployments in separate &lt;i&gt;contexts&lt;/i&gt;. A Meshery &lt;i&gt;context&lt;/i&gt; describes deployments across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl system context&lt;/code&gt; enables user to easy manage multiple deployments of Meshery by quickly switching contexts.&lt;h3&gt;Subscribing to Meshery Release Channels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mesheryctl system channel&lt;/code&gt; allows you to easily set and switch between which Meshery release channel (stable or edge) that you want a particilar Meshery deployment (&lt;code&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;) to use. Meshery deployments subscribe to one of two release channels and can either automatically self-update the deployment or prompt you to update the deployment. Alternatively, you can pin a given Meshery deployment to a specific release should you want tighter control over when Meshery updates. Read more about &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/build-and-release#release-channels&quot;&gt;Meshery&amp;#x27;s &lt;i&gt;stable&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;edge&lt;/i&gt; release channels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl&quot;&gt;mesheryctl Command Reference&lt;/a&gt; for details on all subcommands, flags, and their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;On to v0.6.0&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.5.0 release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.layer5.io/docs/project/releases&quot;&gt;Meshery Documentation&lt;/a&gt;.

We recently launched this new site (it takes a lot to launch a website). Currently, I am working on enhancements to the website and on Layer5’s upcoming discussion forum. I think, after this, you would already know my favorite one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Definitely, winks! Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a part of my college’s open-source organization. I have contributed to and also have mentored a few open-source projects there. Open source is always fun - it doesn&amp;#x27;t matter where you do it. The difference I found here was the vast and diverse community that was missing there. Also, exposure to different technologies was advantageous for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know for me, coming to The Next Generation Layer5 Website was done in the space of 6 months which is really impressive. How was the team able to pull that off?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a pretty big task. Many people have worked on it(At the time of launch we had 140 contributors). It started with Tanuj and me, and then got many hands to help us and strive towards its completion. I can’t write all those names, or else it would take an entire page to note them down. And this is what communities are meant for; open source is intended for. It was a combined effort, and we worked on almost everything. The team worked on Gatsby, GraphQL, SEO, Analytics, and anything related to the website. The two mentors &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote&quot;&gt; Lee &lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/nikhil-ladha&quot;&gt; Nikhil &lt;/a&gt;, were quite helpful for the team to bring it through 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s amazing you are in school and still actively contribute to Layer5, how are you able to multitask it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I once mentioned that while my exams were going on, I would study the entire day, and when I took breaks, I would just open up Github and work on some minor issues. If you are interested in it, you will find a way, I would say. This is what helped me. One of the advantages of being in such a diverse environment is that when you are stuck somewhere, the work doesn&amp;#x27;t stop, some other contributor picks it up, and it goes on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m really curious, what does being a Layer5 maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still remember my first pull request being reviewed. And now I am on the other side, reviewing requests. Being a maintainer was a rollercoaster of an experience to me. You don’t just review PRs and point out changes, but you also have to think of fixes for them. The evolution of green to purple is the joy every open-source contributor wishes to see. And me being the one doing it makes me feel good. Being a maintainer adds responsibility on the one hand and gives freedom on the other hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;I really picked a lot of points on that! Do you have any advice for individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Jash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;My advice would be to not look for becoming something. I never thought of becoming a maintainer. You just enjoy whatever you are doing, and when the time comes, you will get it. Being a maintainer is always special, but what&amp;#x27;s more critical is contributing healthily. A maintainer was always a contributor first, and it is that experience that sails them through. I have already recommended many of my friends and would like to share it with you; if you want to learn open source, Layer5 is the place. We, as a community, are always excited to have more people on board and learning something new from here. I would love to share the stage with you shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was some great advice there and tips! Thanks, Jash for all you do for the community. It’s lovely having you as a maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt; Ruth:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was some great advice there and tips! Thanks, Jash for all you do for the community. It’s lovely having you as a maintainer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;centered-text&quot;&gt;Jash is an impactful contributor and a kind-hearted maintainer. His story is special, but not unique. Take Jash’s advice and engage in our uplifting community. Write your own story. Join the Layer5 Community.

class=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;Meshmate&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;highlight&quot; href=&quot;/community/meshmates&quot;&gt;MeshMate&lt;/a&gt;is a distinction that Layer5 awards select members of the community who innately align with our culture of helping others, paying it forward, and a commitment to knowledge sharing. MeshMates are Layer5 mentors and ambassadors (not employees).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-9kzfnh-0 faVFRg blockquote&quot; style=&quot;position:relative&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Congratulations on the MeshMate of the Year Award, Nikhil, a well-deserved honor for a distinguished gentleman. When I was having a look at the Layer5 community, your member experience blog post stood out and was one of the main reasons for me to join the community. Within the community, it is apparent that your guidance, support, and contributions are very much appreciated. Keep up the excellent work!&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;Michael Gfeller&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Layer5 MeshMate is individual who has consistently demonstrated their commitment to helping community members. The MeshMate program pairs experienced Layer5 community members with community newcomers to ensure a smooth onboarding experience. Helping community members takes all forms from ensuring the member has access to resources, is introduced to others, understands the vision and goals of projects, can build and contribute to projects, can use projects and have their feedback heard. MeshMates aid in identifying areas of projects and activities within the community to engage within, which working groups to join, and in help community members grow in their open source and cloud native knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a lot going in the Layer5 community. Projects and working groups move fast. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates share tips on how to have the best community experience possible, but also build a relationship with the community member inevitably leaving a lasting mark as is evident from member comments about Nikhil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding:2rem 0&quot;&gt;It&amp;#x27;s not easy being a MeshMate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With thousands of members in the Layer5 community, many come and go. Many take and many give. While we hope that each and every individual that joins will find a fit in the community and/or on a project, this isn&amp;#x27;t always the case.&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-1yeq4hm-0 clHbcZ blockquote&quot; style=&quot;position:relative&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;blockquote-quote&quot;&gt;The dedication you have shown on the way to this achievement is impressive, Nikhil. People like you are the key to the great community at Layer5.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;blockquote-person&quot;&gt;—Rodolfo&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;blockquote-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Engaging with and investing in community members can be taxing on mentors in terms of both their time and their emotional investment in seeing the newcomer plant roots, grow, and blossom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the goals MeshMates have is that of enabling the newcomer&amp;#x27;s passion and finding their sweetspot in the community and on a project, so that the newcomer ultimately achieves their goals - goals that are often similar, but different for each person. To help them acheive their goals, each individual is engaged 1:1 by their Meshmate, supporting them in becoming a landstanding Layer5 community member and contributor. MeshMates understand that many mentees start out with the best of intentions, but that not all overcome their hurdles in finding an area of the community to call home or aspect of a project to own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-1yeq4hm-0 clHbcZ blockquote&quot; style=&quot;position:relative&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;blockquote-quote&quot;&gt;Congratulations on being our community maintainer superstar, Nikhil. You has done a great job on our new Layer5 site and your infinite patience on communicating with everyone sets you apart as an awesome community ambassador.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;blockquote-person&quot;&gt;—Aisuko Li&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;blockquote-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;padding:2rem 0&quot;&gt;MeshMates are a massive force&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In just a year&amp;#x27;s time, with thousands of people in the Layer5 community and 500+ contributors to our projects, it&amp;#x27;s clear that Layer5 MeshMates significantly uplift our collaborative efforts and are steady force in the community. In process of confirming Nikhil as the winner of the inaugural MeshMate of the Year award, we looked to the community for validation. Little did I realize that meant reaching out to nearly a hundred people whom Nikhil has mentored or supported in the Layer5 community. More than a few of them had something to say about their time with Nikhil:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;responsive-blog&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-9kzfnh-0 faVFRg blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Nikhil, your Meshery journey probably started in an unbuilt way. Each time you help others to start this awesome journey, you construct a better journey for all, a better way to help others.

It&amp;#x27;s been a long time coming. Honestly, how do you manage your time. I think it&amp;#x27;s safe to say that if it weren&amp;#x27;t for your reviews, half of the codebase in the Meshery UI would be unreadable for new contributors, including my initial commits. Even though we haven&amp;#x27;t interacted much, you have been a great inspiration and I hope that you keep being that inspiration for others joining Layer5.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;Dhruv&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-9kzfnh-0 faVFRg blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hi Mate!

In addition, Meshery adapters can assess to what extent a service mesh complies to the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/announcements/a-standard-interface-for-service-meshes&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface standard&lt;/a&gt;. Meshery adapters support management of multiple versions of their respective service mesh and also come bundled with sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of service mesh capabilities. &lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Meshery adapters manage the lifecycle of service meshes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes the &lt;code&gt;MeshServiceServer&lt;/code&gt;

It does not, as the name might imply, create an instance of a service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;MeshName&lt;/code&gt; returns the name of the mesh, configured in the adapter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SupportedOperations&lt;/code&gt; returns all supported operations, configured in the adapter. An operation is e.g. the installation of a service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ApplyOperation&lt;/code&gt; executes the operation specified in the request. It is one of the supported operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;StreamEvents&lt;/code&gt; allows sending events from the server to the client.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This API is one of the extension points of Meshery, making it easy to add support for new service meshes to Meshery. Meshery adapters abstract away differences in installation and configuration of the various service meshes.&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different service meshes, exposing their differentiated value to users.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the various service mesh implementations are installed and configured in their own way. For instance, some service meshes have their own installer, like &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. One of the purposes of Meshery adapters is to abstract these differences away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meshery Adapter Library&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. Initially, this common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several libraries. After some discussion, the community decided to move some of the more general code to Meshkit, and adapter specific code to a new library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Meshery Adapter Library was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the adapters substantially, making adapter code easier to follow. This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time. For the same reasons, it is important such libraries are easily understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it means new adapters can be implemented quickly, as only configuration and operations that differ between services meshes need to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality that Meshery adapters use for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial commit was submitted on October 6th, 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the Kuma service mesh. Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on the Meshery Adapter Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the Meshery Adapter Library is to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core interface in the library is the adapter &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;/code&gt;

This implementation is also part of the Meshery Adapter Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; embedding, an adapter extends the default implementation &lt;code&gt;Adapter&lt;/code&gt; of the interface &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;/code&gt; from the library.
Usually, it is sufficient that this adapter handler overrides only the &lt;code&gt;ApplyOperation&lt;/code&gt; function from the default implementation.
(There, it is a no-op implementation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure below illustrates this and the usage of the library in an adapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-adapter-library-a77bdfbda32296a59459619f8ddd0765.svg&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; alt=&quot;meshery adapter library&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; package of the adapter, the default configuration provider &lt;code&gt;Viper&lt;/code&gt; from the library is instantiated, and reads the adapter specific configuration. This includes a specification of all available operations. As configuration providers are implementations of an interface, you can choose any of the providers from the library, or implement your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, an instance of the adapter handler is created. Other components, for instance a logger, may be created depending on needs and requirements, which is symbolize by the three dots in the figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;service&lt;/code&gt; is a struct that holds all the parameters that specify an adapter service, like the port the gRPC server is running on, and the instance of the adapter handler created in a previous step. This struct is passed to the &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; function from the library. This &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; function wraps the gRPC server, wiring up all necessary components, and starts the service. The developer does not need to touch any gRPC code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracting common code from adapters to the two new libraries has proven to be a worthwhile investment. It led to cleaner code as well as cleaner application architecture, shortened implementation time for new adapters considerably, and upleveled the quality of Meshery&amp;#x27;s adapters through consistency of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

It also allows me to learn a lot, expanding on my understanding of service meshes, keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and also giving me the opportunity to witness first-hand how others are using them.

Michael is an avid research enthusiast in addition to holding the title of Chief Engineer at his day job. With exhaustive interests ranging from software architecture to systems security, he has been working with cloud architecture for the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the affects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Michael is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made you stay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Shriti, thank you for having me. If I remember correctly, I was looking for a professional focus area earlier this year, and landed on service meshes. I had worked with service meshes before, which piqued my initial interest. I had worked with Istio as part of my work for some time, and in the same context I stumbled across Meshery. I wasn’t able to dig deep in Meshery back then, but the concept sounded fascinating to me. Additionally, I had been benefiting from open source, both personally and professionally for a long time, but apart from a few minor contributions, I had never been able to give back to the community. I hoped to correct that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I re-discovered Meshery and the Layer5 community, listened to a recording of a community meeting, and read a couple of blog posts describing the community and member experience posts. One that stood out for me was a post by &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/nikhil-ladha&quot;&gt;MeshMate Nikhil Ladha&lt;/a&gt;. Going by his words, it appeared to be a warm, diverse and active community. My suspicions were confirmed when I joined. Layer5 offers a wholesome, interactive community in addition to unbiasedly providing help and guidance around the virtual corner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects&quot;&gt;Layer5 projects&lt;/a&gt; has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?&lt;i&gt;Psst.&lt;/i&gt; Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I’m a technical architect and programmer, which made the backend, especially the adapters, a natural choice for me. It involves both contributing to the management plane, but also looking at and using service meshes from an architectural point of view. The possible implementations of service meshes is an area that has been particularly fascinating for me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I’d probably continue to work with the Meshery adapters for now before moving on to other areas of the project. Haha, I would probably name the Meshery Adapter Library as my favorite Layer5 project till date.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have worked and collaborated with several open source communities before, including Eclipse Modelling Framework and Apache ServiceMix . I couldn’t possibly make a very accurate comparison, given by limited interaction with other communities, but the Layer5 community stands out based on the unique and extremely inclusive approach it takes towards upholding community values.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is so fascinating about service meshes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,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&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I find meshes intriguing in general. Meshes can look intricate, layered and complicated at a first glance, and yet they are built on the most basic principles. For me, meshes are visual structures, complete with an aesthetic and artistic dimension. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fun Fact: Overlapping meshes resulting in Moiré patterns are an example of this. They appealed to me from a young age, and I learned about their mathematics from my mathematics teacher.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An increasing number of applications nowadays consist of distributed services, both in the  cloud and on-premises, in mixed and hybrid environments.  Many legacy applications are in express need of modernisation, consuming and being consumed by cloud native applications.  Introducing microservices, also by refactoring monolithic applications, increases the complexity of the service landscape. By delegating cross-cutting infrastructure concerns like security, traffic management, resilience, and observability to the services mesh, some of the complexity is moved from the applications to the service mesh, allowing application developers to focus on business logic. A concern in these distributed, dynamic and scalable systems is that the security also needs to scale. If security doesn’t scale, it becomes very challenging to handle such systems. Services meshes today are already able to support many of these scenarios, and are continuously improving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Service meshes are complex but that is something I enjoy attempting as a challenge, to have control and overview and make it appear simple, investing into automating options. Another field that I’m excited to learn about continuously is related to  the security of distributed systems, and how service meshes contribute to implementing a  zero trust network architecture.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaelgfeller/status/1289951164281233408&quot; target=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dreamed about service mesh&lt;/a&gt; a while ago.

class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haha. Leading on that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Meshery currently does a great job of providing a neutral platform. Continuing in that direction would be a superb base plan.  Enabling innovative applications from vendors, supporting all service meshes, integrating best practice methods, and implementing the SMP and SMI abstractions would probably score the top five positions in Meshery’s new year resolutions in 2021.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interesting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At the moment, Meshery provides a management plane solution and provides support for the SMI and &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; (SMP) specifications. Helpful additions in the future should be the configuration based best practices, especially with regards to security and to possibly extend to owning up specific routes on security. For instance by verifying that the recommendations outlined in the NIST report “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture” by Ramaswamy Chandramouli and Zack Butcher.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are today&amp;#x27;s challenges when working with service meshes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t claim to have worked with many implementations, and to have a good overview and wide experience. A lot of the complexity is already handled, but there is still enough to decide and implement for each solution. The solution makes for a challenging but highly interesting task. Additionally, there are a variety of different solutions from different vendors, which is excellent but it also makes it hard to know which would be the best fit for a given situation. Here, again, Meshery can be of invaluable help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service mesh promise holds a lot of potential, for instance for modernization and ease of use. A lot appears to be happening these times. It will be interesting to see how serverless solutions will be integrated. Enabling a seamless implementation experience for solutions embracing multi-cloud, on-prem and legacy systems is also something to look forward to. Additionally, service meshes are aimed at making your architecture more secure and stable, which makes security a big concern for any service mesh provider. Improvements along these points will be topics I’ll be watching out for over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up. Cloud Native and especially, the field of service meshes evolving exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh implementations consist of many components, and I try to stay up to date in general.  Try to follow as much as possible conferences and vendor announcements, blog posts etc. mainly by following related Twitter accounts. Also, trying to find some time to explore various solutions. Lee’s books are of course an excellent source. Another book I can recommend is Zero Trust Networks book by Gilman and Barth. It really helped me to understand how service meshes relate to zero trust network architecture and can help to move towards it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I take my role as a Meshery maintainer with its benefits and responsibilities. For one, it means to be able to give back to the community. I meet a lot of interesting and friendly people from around the globe, learning about their culture at the same time. Additionally, Open Source allows me to work on and dive into tasks as I like, making it easy to integrate the work with my existing work schedule. It also allows me to learn a lot, expanding on my understanding of service meshes, keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and also giving me the opportunity to witness first-hand how others are using them. This has a quite direct impact on my full-time role, complementing the work I do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A general love for software development combined with a readiness to help out newcomers and participating in the growing community is the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come and visit, there is something for everyone, be it frontend, backend, CI/CD, website, documentation, standards, interfacing with other communities, and more. The friendly community members and the meshmates will provide support and guidance. Browse the Layer5 and Meshery websites and the repositories on GitHub, where issues suitable for newcomers are especially tagged.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/forklift-81115a3780ff378e8848afa4019e458a.svg&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his relatively short tenure at Layer5, Michael has already delivered a wave of meshy contributions enhancing the Meshery adapters and improving upon Meshery’s architecture. With a penchant for looking behind the curtain and tightening loose cogs until they run to perfection, Michael&amp;#x27;s impactful and consistent contributions have him taking his place as Meshery maintainer. The Meshery project moves an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;centered-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Be like Mike&amp;quot;.

As a reliably test tool, Cypress  works with &lt;i&gt;ReactJS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VueJS&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AngularJS&lt;/i&gt; and so on; it is agnostic of the framework you use. You can write all types of tests: &lt;i&gt;end-to-end&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;integration&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;unit tests&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;Tests allow you to ensure that the new code do not break the current one. They help you to develop and integrate new features faster and ensure everything will work after including your changes. The more tests you have, the more coverage you will have (and less likelihood of issues in production).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;UI tests in Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery has two web projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;provider-ui:&lt;/b&gt; A &lt;i&gt;ReactJS&lt;/i&gt; app that allows you to select the Provider to be used for Meshery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;ui:&lt;/b&gt; Also a &lt;i&gt;ReactJS&lt;/i&gt; app where you can do everything related with Meshery. It is the Service Mesh Management Plane.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We create UI tests for both projects using Cypress. Also, we write two types of UI tests at the moment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration:&lt;/b&gt; Test a specific functionality without backend communication (mocking requests and responses)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;End-to-end:&lt;/b&gt; Test a whole flow like setting up Linkerd Service Mesh or running a SMI Performance Test sending requests and validating the responses from the back-end&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to write UI tests for Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are writting your first test, you can read and watch the &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html&quot;&gt;great getting started&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; from Cypress blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you have to add your test below &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;provider-ui/cypress/integration&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;ui/cypress/integration&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; folders (do not forget adding &lt;i&gt;_spec&lt;/i&gt; in the filename).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a basic example of a test validating that &lt;b&gt;Provider UI component&lt;/b&gt; exists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-javascript&quot;

Within cloud native deployments, an increasingly common approach to networking is the service mesh concept. With a service mesh, instead of each individual container requiring a full networking stack, a grouping of containers all benefit from a mesh that provides connectivity and networking with other containers as well as the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh in the wild
While the concept of a service mesh has applicability beyond just Kubernetes deployments, that&amp;#x27;s arguably where the vast majority of deployments are today. Among the earliest cloud-native service mesh approaches is the open source Linkerd project, which is backed by Buoyant and began to really ramp up adoption in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years there has been an explosion of open source service mesh technology. Layer5, which develops service mesh aggregation technology, currently tracks over 20 different open and closed source mesh projects. Beyond Linkerd, among the most popular is the Google-backed Istio project, which recently hit its 1.8 milestone release. Cisco has backed the Network Service Mesh (NSM) effort, which works at a lower level in the networking stack than Linkerd, Istio and most others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each mesh has its own take on configuration and capabilities, which is a good thing for users. Simply put, there is no shortage of options and there is likely to be a service mesh that already exists to meet just about any need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh abstraction
While having lots of different service mesh technologies is good for choice, it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily a good thing for simplicity or interoperability. That&amp;#x27;s where the concept of service mesh abstraction comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the recent KubeCon NA 2020 virtual event, Lee Calcote, co-chair of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) and founder of Layer5, outlined how the different service mesh abstraction technologies fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a way for any compliant service mesh to plug into Kubernetes. The Service Mesh Performance (SMP) abstraction is all about providing visibility into service mesh performance though a common interface. The third key abstraction is known as Hamlet and it provides multi-vendor service interoperation and mesh federation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh benefits
There are a number of different benefits that service meshes can bring, which are helping to accelerate adoption. Calcote explained that with a service mesh there is a decoupling of developer and operations teams such that each can iterate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, operators can make changes to infrastructure independent of developers. DevOps is supposed to mean developer and operations teams work together, but the reality is often quite different and the ability to build application and infrastructure separately is why service mesh has been such a winning proposition for so many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We live within a software defined network landscape, and service meshes in some respects are sort of a next-gen SDN,&amp;quot; Calcote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the full article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/datacenter-blog/service-mesh-cloud-native-networking.html&quot;&gt;Enterprise Networking Planet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[KubeCon+CloudNativeCon]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

Unable to engage all the user requests, the streaming service and the website broke down and ultimately resulted in DoS (Denial of Service). There are numerous examples of service crashes across different platforms, which has forced developers to take a closer look at performance benchmarking and pre-launch performance checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several advantages of preliminary service benchmarking, which may extensively enhance the response time, resolve glitches, enhance the application&amp;#x27;s robustness, and bring together several other commendable factors, including but not limited to stability and dependability within an application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several tools for performance benchmarking. A major one is the interconnected relationship between load generators and benchmarks. Some of the well-known load generators in the cloud native realm are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fortio&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wrk2/Wrk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects/nighthawk&quot;&gt;Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion can be encapsulated as following, Meshery, the service mesh management plane possesses the ability to generate load and benchmark services in/out of your service mesh using Fortio, Wrk2 and now, Nighthawk too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery + Nighthawk = Robust Distributed and Scalable Services&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nighthawk, written and maintained by the Envoy Community, is a L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool that supports performance benchmarking using HTTP or gRPC services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nighthawk is built using open-source builds and test tool Bazel and supports output formatting to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards. To add more to the list, it will soon support distributed performance benchmarking which is currently under an active development stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Meshery, written and maintainer by Layer5 Community is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. With Meshery, you can both, manage your service mesh&amp;#x27;s lifecycle, and benchmark them with industry-grade tools to let you know how much under or over-utilized your services are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/smp-99801e71c2cb321b2eb06c8c3e7efb8e.png&quot; alt=&quot;smp-image&quot; class=&quot;image-left smp-image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, Meshery is going to be a canonical implementation for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; which is a common and standardised format to describe : - Performance test configuration - Service mesh configuration - Environment configuration - Workload configuration - Performance test results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How did we achieve it ?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following project was proposed as a Google Summer of Code Idea, I was selected as a student mentee to draft the design, architecture and code my way from scratch. On my journey, I received guidance from some amazing mentors, colleagues and open-source stake holders. I discussed the design proposal with Envoy Team as well as Layer5 Team and from suggestions from both, I was able to complete my project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the course of the project, I came up with the idea of invoking Nighthawk as a separate container with which Meshery will communicate using a go-lang based middleware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my elation, the project was a huge success and Nighthawk is now invoked as a load-generator in Meshery. Soon, the public release for the new version will be made and users will be able to utilize Nighthawk as a performance-benchamark tool alongside with Fortio and Wrk2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#x27;s next?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just the first relay, in the long run, there are many more milestones to come. The following is a list of projects which will be completed in upcoming months:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Invoke Nighthawk as an gRPC Service and support gRPC connection between Nighthawk &amp;amp; Meshery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implement user-profiles for performance benchmarking which may store some preset preferred values according to users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhance Nighthawk to support distributed load generation and performance benchmarking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;NATS &amp;amp; gRPC Performance Benchmarking for gRPC and NATS services invoked in Meshery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;and many more awesome and bleeding-edge ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can I get involved?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.

Coming to Layer5, the frontend of Meshery is built on React( another masterpiece from Facebook! ), which I learned from scratch when I joined the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/pic2-6dc74a3a8d6efb33343e79e43e2e2a65.jpeg&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;Nikhil-ladha-work&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, months have passed and with some healthy dedication and hours of staring at thousands of lines of code, I have a good base and practical experience with React, something which you can’t hope to gain from personal projects and require a community for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Layer5 and Meshery websites are built using Jekyll, another technology about which I didn’t have any practical knowledge a couple of months ago. Easier than react and harder than CSS, Jekyll is perfect for the aspiring web developers out there and is also another reason for you to pop over to the Layer5 repo after reading this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshy goodness&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;My experience at Layer5 has made me proud of the work that we do and has challenged me time and again to reach for higher goals. I still have a hunch that someway or the other my contributions are responsible for getting me an internship at Red Hat! All heads bowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote/&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt; for his presence and guidance and to the Layer5 community for being as amazing as it is. My journey at Layer5 has been an ever growing curve to be honest from just a contributor to a MeshMate to the maintainer of few projects at Layer5. And, true to god this wouldn’t have been possible without the combined effort from me and our very own Lee Calcote. His trust and confidence in me is what encourages me to contribute more and more at Layer5 and see it grow to some next level in the coming future.

class=&quot;image-left&quot; alt=&quot;Layer5 and Istio&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started learning on Service Mesh and it was a very interesting journey as I explored the Service Mesh
landscape starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/istio-service-mesh-workshop&quot;&gt;Layer5 tutorials&lt;/a&gt; and by exploring
the blogs at &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/&quot;&gt;Istio.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our organization decided to use the features of Istio for securing, managing and automating microservices. However, we have to support a multi-tenant environment and that became a challenge due to lack of sufficient documentation and clarity. To give a little bit of background on the problem, we have a single cluster with multiple tenants in different namespaces sharing the same cluster . We do not want to provide each tenant their own separate Kubernetes Cluster because that would be additional provisioning overhead, management overhead and also additional resource overhead on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will go over the concepts and visual representation as well as the steps to learn and build your setup.
Now there are different combinations possible depending on the requirements. These could be :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Single Istio Control Plane with its own Ingress-Gateway to ensure traffic for the control plane is coming via the same control plane Ingress-Gateway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One or more Workspace namespaces for the workload applications and each with its own instance of the ingress gateway&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More advanced scenario would be multiple Control Plane and its associated Data Plane or essentially Multiple Service Mesh within a single Kubernetes Cluster. This is presently feasible using the Maistra Istio Operator, but its not fully supported using the upstream Istio at present. I intend to go over this use case in a later article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here by Ingress Gateway we mean the Istio Ingress Gateway and not the Kubernetes Ingress Gateway.
Now, before we get into the steps for building an Istio Multi-tenant setup, lets quickly review the prerequisite :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes setup (in the steps below I am using v1.18 on ubuntu 18.04)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-sh&quot;

but before that a few word on the Istio operator would be nice. The Istio Operator follows the Kubernetes Controller and Custom Resource Definition mechanism and basically the above steps create an Istio operator controller in the istio-operator namespace and also registers the CRDs in the Kubernetes Registry. Basically, it extends the API for Kubernetes and allows management of a Custom Resource(CR). A word of caution, the existing upstream Istio Operator does not follow any Operator Framework like kubebuilder or Operator SDK. Hence, many of the expected behavior fail like trying to create two Istio Operator Custom Resource(the community mentions it as &lt;code&gt;iop&lt;/code&gt; instances) in different namespaces or multiple &lt;code&gt;iop&lt;/code&gt; instances and are under heavy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now lets jump into action. We will build our Istio Setup for the scenario 1 &amp;amp;2 above shown in the diagram below. There are three different instances of Ingress Gateway(and it could be egress gateway as well) :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. Ingress Gateway in Control Plane for traffic entry point to the Control plane Observability Components like &lt;code&gt;Kiali&lt;/code&gt;(for the Service Mesh Graph), &lt;code&gt;Prometheus&lt;/code&gt;(for metrics),Grafana(for visual charts of the metrics)and &lt;code&gt;Jaeger&lt;/code&gt; (for distributed tracing between the services)
b. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 1 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 1 microservices.
c. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 2 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 2 microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image1-9ca07a8b7898eea78438d3a29e616607.png&quot; alt=&quot;kubernetes-cluster&quot;/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Single Control Plane with Multiple Data Plane each with separate Ingress Gateway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creation of Control Plane CR and Data Plane CR
A sample CR for creation of the Control plane and Data Plane CR can be referred below :&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-sh&quot;

It is important to ensure the label maps the label on the ingress-gateway.
Once this is done the traffic will start flowing the intended gateway and it could be observed on the Kiali dashboard.
Please note that in this scenario the Kiali is also accessed via the default control plane ingress-gateway running in the istio-system control plane namespace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image3-a7064343f9f3358df30c889083194628.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Kiali view for Workspace-1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image4-9b7ccbc6fb957cb46688f46d86f1f568.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Kiali view for Workspace-2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly, we will go over the 3rd scenario which is to run multiple Istio Control Planes (Multiple Service Meshes) within the same Kubernetes Cluster. For that, we will need to build an open-shift setup and deploy the Maistra Istio Operator.

I did some research on service meshes and made my way to the Layer5 Github repo.

specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec&quot;&gt;SMI Github Repository&lt;/a&gt;. Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;APIs in SMI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs&quot;&gt;Traffic Specs&lt;/a&gt; - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control&quot;&gt;Traffic Access Control&lt;/a&gt; - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split&quot;&gt;Traffic Split&lt;/a&gt; - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics&quot;&gt;Traffic Metrics&lt;/a&gt; - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About SMI Conformance Tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMI Conformance Tests&lt;/strong&gt; check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds fun, right?

align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;checklist&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;  is _the service mesh management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.&lt;p&gt;As you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Forking &lt;a href=&quot;https://kuttl.dev/&quot;&gt;kuttl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt; is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It&amp;#x27;s entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked &lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt; and modified it a little. You can see our modified version &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are planning to use &lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt; for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of &lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/&quot;&gt;Learn Layer5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and &lt;code&gt;smi-conformance&lt;/code&gt; testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.
Head over to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Slack Channel&lt;/a&gt; and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Summer of Code 2020: Service Mesh Performance with Envoy Nighthawk]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;cncf-landscape-stacked-color&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Digging into Service Meshes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half ago I got interested in service mesh technology. A customer needed some advanced routing capabilities and we started looking at Envoy and Istio. Then - invitations to talk about Istio at meetups and conferences started flowing in. That&amp;#x27;s when I got excited about progressive delivery capabilities that service meshes enable. I even wrote a Kubernetes Istio canary controller - BirdWatch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Finding Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging deeper into what service meshes had to offer I discovered Meshery - the universal service mesh management plane. And immediately joined Layer5 - the great, welcoming open-source community that created it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Matters&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a member of Layer5 was one of the nicest community experiences I&amp;#x27;ve ever had. Mainly thanks to community&amp;#x27;s founder and captain - Lee Calcote. He always makes sure everybody feels significant, included and motivated to participate. And this spirit spreads out to all community activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In no time, I had my first commits approved and merged and started joining weekly community and development video calls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We&amp;#x27;re on CNCF Landscape!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now - I won&amp;#x27;t be reviewing Meshery in this post. I&amp;#x27;ve spoken about it in this video and some great introductory articles by community members can be found here and here. This post is more of a celebration, because last week...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5 align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meshery now featured in the CNCF Landscape!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/cncf-meshery-landscape-eb471a881677198903da60e1c7f4fa5d.png&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; alt=&quot;cncf-meshery-landscape&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is only the first step - there&amp;#x27;s already an application filed for Meshery to become a full-fledged CNCF sandbox project. I had a chance to collaborate on the sandbox proposal and am so eager for this to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Getting Meshy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also an invitation to participate - Meshery is a young, ambitious project - it requires a ton of work to make it what it aims to become. Integrating with all of the leading service mesh solutions asks for extensive expertise. In many areas Meshery&amp;#x27;s functionality is still young. But these are normal growth stages, aren&amp;#x27;t they? To put it simple - the community and the project need more hands! And these should be your hands!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;As already mentioned - Layer5 is a very welcoming bunch!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can&amp;#x27;t be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! Hop on to Layer5 Slack and we&amp;#x27;ll happily embrace you and help you get started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it&amp;#x27;s not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example - I sometimes wish I had more time and motivation to code new Meshery features or fix existing bugs. But instead I&amp;#x27;m writing this post. Because lately I enjoy writing texts more than coding. Coding for longer than a couple of days at a time throws me into a coding fatigue… Actually also many other activities do. I&amp;#x27;m just not very good at keeping a routine. But I&amp;#x27;m sure many of you out there aren&amp;#x27;t like me. So why not join forces?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join the service mesh community!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery is an exciting opportunity to learn more about service meshes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#x27;re already on CNCF Landscape and are headed for the sandbox.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now is a great time to hop on board. Are you ready? Get into the mesh pit!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layer5 and HashiCorp Launch Service Mesh Partnership]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

Layer5’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;, the service mesh management plane, and HashiCorp’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://consul.io&quot;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt; integrate to provide advanced, cloud native infrastructure solutions for containerized and non-containerized workloads - strengths of Consul. The marriage of these technologies forms a layering of network planes: data, control, and management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/Layer5-HashiCorp-Service-Mesh-Partnership-44f0a1cc7276da44dd39915fe5bc8b2e.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/Layer5-HashiCorp-Service-Mesh-Partnership-44f0a1cc7276da44dd39915fe5bc8b2e.png&quot; alt=&quot;layer5-hashicorp-partnership&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Service Mesh Planes: Consul and Meshery. Learn more about service mesh planes in &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/books/the-enterprise-path-to-service-mesh-architectures&quot;&gt;The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consul’s broad and prevalent use across &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/datacenter-deploy/reference-architecture&quot;&gt;any runtime or infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; (bare metal servers, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and any cloud) is a key facilitator of the modernization of IT infrastructure - a significant attractant for Layer5 to focus on this integration; to meet customers where they’re at. The lynchpin of the integration of Consul and Meshery is the Meshery Adapter for Consul. Through this adapter, Meshery facilitates lifecycle management of Consul service mesh deployments, evaluates and espouses configuration best practices published by HashiCorp. Meshery provides users with an interface to apply custom configuration to their Consul service mesh in an ad hoc fashion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lifecycle management of sample applications&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Consul&lt;/a&gt; comes bundled with a handful of sample applications for evaluating, exploring, and learning how to operate Consul service mesh. Many operators are new to the ongoing administrative tasks of running a healthy and optimized Consul service mesh deployment. In advance of their production deployments, operators may utilize Meshery to quickly deploy Consul with sample applications to gain familiarity with the many features of Consul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demonstrated at DockerCon 2020, is the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub&quot;&gt;Image Hub&lt;/a&gt;”, a sample application built to allow users to explore Consul’s feature set, and specifically, an experimental area of Consul’s data plane: Envoy’s impending support for WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Performance management of Consul and it’s workloads&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to assess the overall performance of the service mesh, and the overhead of individual, fine-grained traffic control mechanisms defined in Consul’s control plane and enforced through Consul’s intelligent data plane, Meshery provides users with statistical analysis of the responsiveness of their services and performance of the service mesh. As highlighted by Docker Captain, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lucjuggery&quot;&gt;Luc Juggery&lt;/a&gt;, performance is an ongoing concern:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin:20px&quot;&gt;Running a performance test is not a one shot thing. Tests should be run on a regular basis to (re)establish baselines and evaluate configuration changes:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;- for each new release of the chosen service mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- for each change of the configuration of your service mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;- for each new release of the application&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery’s ability to connect to Prometheus instances to retrieve and account for cluster and application-level metrics is popularly used during Meshery’s service mesh performance tests. Likewise, Meshery’s ability to connect to and import existing dashboards, panels, and charts from Grafana is instrumental in allowing users to retain their existing investment in dashboards and metrics they have curated over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meshery Announces Experimental Support for WebAssembly using Consul&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, at &lt;a href=&quot;https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/content/Videos/63TCCNpzDC7Xxnm8b&quot;&gt;DockerCon 2020&lt;/a&gt;, we demonstrate technology leadership in advanced data plane engineering for near-native performance of fine-grained traffic control facilitated by Meshery and Consul with the use of Envoy and WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/layer5-image-hub-on-hashicorp-consul-3c51456fd54ba499b00d97d93f32c996.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/layer5-image-hub-on-hashicorp-consul-3c51456fd54ba499b00d97d93f32c996.png&quot; alt=&quot;layer5-hashicorp-imagehub&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this demonstration, Meshery takes advantage of Consul’s use of Envoy. Envoy support for WebAssembly is impending.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;WebAssembly’s near-native performance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly, or WASM, is an open standard that defines a binary format for executable programs. Through WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), it also defines interfaces for facilitating interaction with host environments. The initial focus of these host environments was browsers and large web applications with the intention of securely running programs to improve performance. As an open standard, WASM is maintained by the W3C, and has been adopted by all modern browsers. After HTML, CSS, and Javascript, WebAssembly is the fourth language to natively run in web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WebAssembly is exciting because of its performance characteristics, running between 10% to 20% overhead as compared to natively executed code for network filtering use cases. WebAssembly bears some resemblance to Docker given its high degree of portability. Like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), WASM’s virtual stack machine is becoming a write once, run anywhere (WORA). WASM executables are precompiled with a healthy variety of languages supporting it as a compilation target - currently about 40 languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASM support is coming to Envoy through the efforts of Google, and Envoy maintainers embedding Google&amp;#x27;s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, V8, into Envoy. Through the WebAssembly System Interface, Envoy exposes an Application Binary Interface (ABI) to WASM modules, so that they can operate as Envoy filters. The way WASI works is straight-forward. You write your application in your favourite languages like Rust, C or C++. Then, build and compile them into a WebAssembly binary targeting the host environment. The generated binary requires the WebAssembly runtime to provide the necessary interfaces to system calls for the binary to execute. Conceptually, this is similar to JVM. If you have a JVM installed then you can run any Java-like languages on it. Similarly, with a runtime, you can run the WebAssembly binary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learn more&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integration of management, control, and data planes is a powerful combination.

Meshery is created by the &lt;a href=&quot;/community&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 is a community-first, service mesh company which has technology &lt;a href=&quot;partners&quot;&gt;partnerships&lt;/a&gt; with various tech giants like Microsoft, HashiCorp, CNCF, RedHat and many more to enlist. The community consists of open source leaders like maintainers of trending open-source projects, Google SoCers, Docker Captains, service mesh maintainers, Cloud Native Ambassadors and many more (&lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;join in!&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is mesheryctl?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery provides you with a clean, robust, streamlined command-line interface to manage and benchmark your service meshes, &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt;. With &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt;, not only you can manage your adapters &amp;amp; containers but you can also benchmark your mesh using the command line. &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt; provides support to a number of platforms so that we never miss out users. &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt; can be installed with a single bash command by simply executing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(130, 170, 255)&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; -L https://git.io/meshery &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token assign-left variable&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(214, 222, 235)&quot;&gt;PLATFORM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kubernetes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(130, 170, 255)&quot;&gt;bash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;in your terminal.

It lets you benchmark your service mesh without using the Meshery UI from the command line interface itself. Once you type &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl perf&lt;/code&gt;, it will present you with all the powerful flags you can control with CLI, including providing it with a &lt;code&gt;--file&lt;/code&gt; flag that points to any of a number of performance test profiles that you may have saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Performance Management and Benchmarking using Meshery CLI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

Speaking about the use of traffic management functionalities, Calcote said: “Folks tend to be a little more advanced as they get into that because they’re at that point they’re actually affecting traffic and then routing requests differently, as opposed to something like just purely observing or getting a ‘read-only’ view in their environment.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;See the full, &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenewstack.io/what-the-numbers-say-about-how-service-meshes-are-used-today/&quot;&gt;original article&lt;/a&gt; published on The New Stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learn Cloud Native: Managing service meshes with Meshery]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

though Istio is getting better in this regard)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is covered in the video? More or less the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;What service mesh tech allows us to do&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What a typical service mesh architecture looks like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Layer5 is about (&lt;i&gt;Lookout - it may surprise you!&lt;/i&gt; 😯)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Meshery is. What Linkerd is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How easy it is to install Meshery on your PC (be it Linux, Mac or Windows)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;All it takes is:&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-sh&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;$ curl -L https://git.io/meshery | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Meshery connects to your Kubernetes cluster (nothing to be done if it’s in your &lt;code&gt;kubectl config current-context&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to correctly install and remove Linkerd on your Kubernetes cluster using Meshery&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to install one of included Linkerd sample applications and verify the installation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s quite a lot of content for a 20 minute clip. In the follow-up videos, we’ll dive deeper into many of these concepts. And also show how to use Meshery with other service mesh providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This video is also the opening shot of Layer5&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A-A6hPO2IN_HSU0pSfijBboiHggs5mC&quot;&gt;Learn to Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt; playlist, which is specifically dedicated to tutorials and webinars.

They also saw it as a way to address unsustainable manual traffic management processes."), mdx("p", null, "In 2019, the success of service mesh implementation inspired a rush of vendors that hoped to cash in on the need to manage services at scale. The industry saw a booming sub-ecosystem around two major service mesh options, Google's Istio and the open source Envoy, plus many \xE0 la carte tools, such as Tetrate and Meshery. A handful of newcomers jumped into the fray, such as HashiCorp, Kong, Containous, Aspen Mesh and Layer5. Despite the competition, Istio and Envoy led the pack."), mdx("p", null, "The service mesh market saw two significant events in 2019. First, Envoy Project Authors fine-tuned its increasingly popular sidecar proxy design pattern. Second, Google kept its service mesh technology, and Istio, out of the open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and thereby retained proprietary control.")));

This way, software teams can centralize communication, rather than monitor each individual service message exchange independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When service mesh emerged in 2018, many saw this technology as a way to tackle the complexity of container deployment at production scale. They also saw it as a way to address unsustainable manual traffic management processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the success of service mesh implementation inspired a rush of vendors that hoped to cash in on the need to manage services at scale. The industry saw a booming sub-ecosystem around two major service mesh options, Google&amp;#x27;s Istio and the open source Envoy, plus many à la carte tools, such as Tetrate and Meshery. A handful of newcomers jumped into the fray, such as HashiCorp, Kong, Containous, Aspen Mesh and Layer5. Despite the competition, Istio and Envoy led the pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service mesh market saw two significant events in 2019. First, Envoy Project Authors fine-tuned its increasingly popular sidecar proxy design pattern. Second, Google kept its service mesh technology, and Istio, out of the open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and thereby retained proprietary control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New Stack: Meshery in top 3 service mesh developments in 2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

More specifically, my contributions concerned one specific page of that website: its &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/landscape&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Landscape page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after making these contributions, I was graciously welcomed into the Layer5 community by its lead developer &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lcalcote?lang=en&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, who later directly approached me to assist him in furthering his vision for the Landscape page by implementing &amp;quot;comparative spectrums&amp;quot;. Wishing to focus on my remaining two Hacktoberfest contributions at the time, I suggested surveying the interest of other potential contributors for this project. As such, an informative issue was opened:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/PR-211-5df0a63f10b16c550989a1077b08b439.png&quot; alt=&quot;PR 211&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211&quot;&gt;layer5#211&lt;/a&gt;: add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month later, I fortunately found time enough to make some major progress into this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This issue is quite highly conceptual, much moreso than any other issue I have thus far worked on. I decided that the best way to approach this issue would be to focus on establishing a set of tools that could be used by more-knowledgeable contributors to later construct comparative spectrums—opinionated data visualizations. As such, my first step was to build a set of responsive graphical elements that resembled &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6&quot;&gt;those provided as examples&lt;/a&gt;.

8&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;(4) &lt;em&gt;Spectrum-like graphical comparisons:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/graph-compare-3f3f78808bcaf390805f39264b791b8e.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Source: &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6&quot;&gt;ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 7&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Although there may exist libraries that may help construct such graphical elements, I did not want to introduce additional libraries to accomplish my work. Instead, I wanted to make good use of Layer5io&amp;#x27;s preexisting &lt;a href=&quot;https://materializecss.com/&quot;&gt;Materialize&lt;/a&gt; library. Fortunately, Materialize strongly supports the design of card-like structures, allowing me to more easily &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-20fc098534d6aab31ad8e5c9db51bde0R10&quot;&gt;implement some&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Unfortunately, it does not seem that Materialize supports the creation of graphical arrows, so I just ended up &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R2&quot;&gt;styling my own&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) These tables can be quite easily implemented and styled with or without the use of &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;table&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. I anticipate these will be given a proper fleshing out after the other graphical elements are further developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) These unique spectrum graphics present the most challenging, of all the comparison tools, to implement. Snaking spectrum bar aside, I needed to develop a &lt;em&gt;responsive&lt;/em&gt; solution that (a) allowed contributors to programmatically place image thumbnails at preset horizontal positions, while (b) ensuring those thumbnails placed at the same position do not overlap with one another (and instead align vertically atop each other).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This presented a problem to solve: I required a means to &amp;#x27;float&amp;#x27; elements toward a horizontal line; to &amp;#x27;stack&amp;#x27; thumbnails atop one another, without overlap, if they are given the same horizontal position. After researching quite deeply into potential solutions to this problem, I ended up stumbling across some CSS property-value pairings that I had never heard of before: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;display: grid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid-auto-flow.asp&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grid-auto-flow: row dense&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Miraculously, I discovered that these could actually function as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R76&quot;&gt;a basis for a solution&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;After styling the graphical elements, I continued the website&amp;#x27;s trend of using &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; tags (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/iteration-tags#for&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html&quot;&gt;YAML lists&lt;/a&gt; to help modularize my solutions, which should aid future contributors in generalizing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I opened &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238&quot;&gt;a pull request&lt;/a&gt; to share my work as well as invite collaboration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/PR-211-2-1d8428a9657f709411d154e1758dc131.png&quot; alt=&quot;PR 211-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull request &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238&quot;&gt;layer5#238&lt;/a&gt;: description of tooling introduced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image-3c0dc8db2002a5f50a0fa91ccfa8c00f.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull request &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238&quot;&gt;layer5#238&lt;/a&gt;: example images of tooling introduced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pull request was quite well-recieved:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/comment-15bfa09e17d2d5a4658073891283ca77.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comment&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-554181763&quot;&gt;Comment&lt;/a&gt; by Layer5 team lead on pull request &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238&quot;&gt;layer5#238&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in a recent Layer5 community meeting, I am very excited to continue working with Layer5; to refine and expand upon this set of new, visionary tooling for their landscape!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forrester: Layer5 and Meshery Help Developers Focus On The Business]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

Although Layer5.io&amp;#x27;s then-difficult-to-read hyperlinks were colored &lt;code&gt;#ffa_b_40&lt;/code&gt;, I&amp;#x27;d still like to think that the second task of my second Hacktoberfest contribution was festively-themed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/&quot;&gt;my last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that &lt;a href=&quot;https://materializecss.com&quot;&gt;Materialize CSS&lt;/a&gt; was worth further research. Well, after some poking around, I discovered that all of Layer5.io&amp;#x27;s pumpkin-colored hyperlink styling (both &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L1751&quot;&gt;deliberate&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L5149&quot;&gt;incidental&lt;/a&gt;) originated from its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css&quot;&gt;materialize.css&lt;/a&gt; asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this asset has been &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commits/master/assets/css/materialize.css&quot;&gt;frequently modified&lt;/a&gt;, I was still hesitant to globally alter the site&amp;#x27;s styling (in case a return to Pumpkin Bread was desired in the future), so I instead opted to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209/files#diff-48443fc170100677376b7ee11324494b&quot;&gt;add a new inline style tag&lt;/a&gt; to override &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L5149&quot;&gt;a styling rule&lt;/a&gt; (on top of removing the &amp;#x27;orange-text&amp;#x27; class from individual anchor elements).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the changes I&amp;#x27;ve made can be viewed through &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209&quot;&gt;my (merged) pull request&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.png?w=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.png?w=1024&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull request &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209&quot;&gt;layer5io#209&lt;/a&gt;: resolved the remainder of issue &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65&quot;&gt;layerio#65&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very fortunate to be so well-supported by the open source communities I have worked with so far, both on-campus and abroad. With their support behind me, I feel equipped to start learning what I need to know to resolve the next two more-difficult issues that lie ahead of me!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hacktoberfest 2019: documenting my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

Today, I am happy to showcase my resolution of one of those issues, marking my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5&quot;&gt;Layer5.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I continue on, I want to acknowledge the project that I have contributed to. In &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/gsoc/2019&quot;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; discussing their participating in the Google Summer of Code 2019 program, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is described as a community which represents &amp;quot;the largest collection of &lt;em&gt;service mesh&lt;/em&gt; projects and their maintainers in the world&amp;quot;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh&quot;&gt;RedHat.com&lt;/a&gt; helpfully defines a service mesh as &amp;quot;a dedicated infrastructure layer&amp;quot; of an application that controls how different parts of that application (&amp;quot;services&amp;quot;) share data with one another (i.e. &amp;#x27;mesh together&amp;#x27;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Selecting my first Hacktoberfest issue&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned my last post, I came into contact with Layer5 after discovering (through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest-finder.netlify.com/&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest Issue Finder&lt;/a&gt;) its &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65&quot;&gt;issue regarding table filtering&lt;/a&gt;—and subsequently discovered an unreported styling issue. &lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.png&quot; alt=&quot;A styling issue with a collection of lists hosted on Layer5&amp;#x27;s Landscape page.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A styling issue affected a collection of lists hosted on Layer5&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/landscape&quot;&gt;Landscape page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the three GitHub issues I&amp;#x27;ve scoped out, the resolution of this styling issue (i.e. tweaking CSS) represents the simplest of tasks that I have lined up—and an ideal candidate for a first-time Hacktoberfest contribution!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as I could tell, no open issues concerned the styling problem that I discovered. So, as instructed both Layer5&amp;#x27;s website (and encouraged its extremely-welcoming development team), I opened &lt;em&gt;my own issue&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191&quot;&gt;Enhance landscape categories section wrapping (#191)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.png?w=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.png?w=1024&quot; alt=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identifying a solution&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this issue, I came up with the idea of realigning the category list items horizontally, transforming the poorly-behaving columns of category &amp;#x27;cards&amp;#x27; into rows in a responsive and easily-scalable vertical stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementating this idea proved quite simple, requiring only &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508&quot;&gt;a few added CSS rules&lt;/a&gt;, which I first accomplished by tinkering with the live webpage&amp;#x27;s styling (with the help of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/&quot;&gt;Stylish&lt;/a&gt; browser extension):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-css&quot;

The dashed borders and padding used to separate category lists was also adjusted to accomodate the new design (pictured below):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above image is one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508&quot;&gt;two mockups of the redesign&lt;/a&gt; that I produced for the consideration of the project&amp;#x27;s developers. As luck would have it, Layer5 project lead &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/leecalcote&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt; provided &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179&quot;&gt;a lightning-quick response&lt;/a&gt;, welcoming a pull request to it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.png?w=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.png?w=1024&quot; alt=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Future research area: Materialize CSS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I discovered that the &amp;#x27;cards&amp;#x27; comprising the category section are styled using &lt;a href=&quot;https://materializecss.com/&quot;&gt;Materialize CSS&lt;/a&gt;. I considered using this framework in my solution, but ultimately decided to opt for a simple, intuitive solution. This framework appears interesting, and would definitely merits research were this a more-involved styling task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Implementing the solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While using my browser&amp;#x27;s developer tools to tinker with styling, I discovered an inline &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag that serviced the categories section. I determined that this tag would present the best place to add the styling rules that I wrote (following the coding style of a prior contributor).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the location of this &lt;code&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; tag (i.e. of the &amp;quot;Service Mesh Landscape&amp;quot; page) in the source code was a lot more trouble than I thought it would be. After paging through too many HTML documents, I gave in and used Visual Studio&amp;#x27;s global search functionality to locate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Testing the solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although I knew that my styling worked well when loaded from a browser extension, before I could contribute code, I needed to ensure that the styling worked equally-well when loaded inline from an HTML document. Little did I know, at that time, what I would be getting myself into...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ruby, Gems and Jekyll? &lt;code&gt;rvm&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picking through my ~/.bash_history file, here is the sequence of Bash shell commands that I issued (via WSL Ubuntu) in order to execute a local copy of the layer5 website (annotated for your convenience):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-sh&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;## Install dependency packages ##&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install build-essential&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get install software-properties-common&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 VeQRG&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

Setting up the means to run &lt;code&gt;make site&lt;/code&gt; is not included within Layer5&amp;#x27;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md&quot;&gt;CONTRIBUTING.md file&lt;/a&gt;. As such, for the most novice of contributors, like myself (who have never even heard of &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt; before), setting up the prerequisite development environment presented a lengthy and piecemeal (albeit ultimately valuable) learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much documentation is too little? Too much? How high should the bar be set for contribution? I suppose it is up to the project&amp;#x27;s community to decide upon the answers to these questions themselves (and write documentation, accordingly).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creating a pull request&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After successfully testing and fixing the styling on my local fork, I created &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192&quot;&gt;a pull request&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.png?w=1024&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.png?w=1024&quot; alt=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pull request – &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192&quot;&gt;Restyle landscape categories (#192)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...and it got merged! First Hacktoberfest contribution, completed!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Up next!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended &lt;a href=&quot;https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; by stating that I have yet to gain any experience with makefiles. Well, thanks to my work on Layer5, that is no longer true: I have since used a makefile (to launch a Jekyll executable)! This experience will undoubtedly save me some time with resolving &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Comcast/RestfulHttpsProxy/issues/5&quot;&gt;the Comcast issue I found&lt;/a&gt;! However, the next Hacktoberfest issue I resolve will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;the first one I blogged about&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

And cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Environment Setup&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we start having &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/install/&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/&quot;&gt;docker-compose&lt;/a&gt; is also mandatory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rancher/k3d&quot;&gt;k3d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/&quot;&gt;WSL2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;For the (few) ones who know me, my &amp;quot;OS base&amp;quot; is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(optional)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h4&gt; Nothing is taken for granted &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won&amp;#x27;t explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no &amp;quot;just have to ...&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;by simply doing ...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nunixtech&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Layer5 Slack channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Meshery Installation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start docker and confirm it&amp;#x27;s running:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eFTvLZ&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 kGfgjg prism-code language-bash&quot;

should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;static/wsl-meshery-complete-7f1e77a7637c9dd06080d03fc90ddf20.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/wsl-meshery-complete-7f1e77a7637c9dd06080d03fc90ddf20.png&quot; class=&quot;thumbnail&quot; alt=&quot;wslmesherycomplete&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lcalcote&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt; put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery &amp;gt; k3s (deployed via k3d) &amp;gt; Docker &amp;gt; WSL2 &amp;gt; Windows 10. And he&amp;#x27;s totally right, still the &amp;quot;beauty&amp;quot; here, is that it &amp;quot;simply works&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.
Even Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different service meshes. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the &amp;quot;Bonuses&amp;quot;, more fun to come!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &amp;gt; &lt;i&gt;Nunix out&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Standard Interface for Service Meshes]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

alt=&quot;SMI Logo&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most began their cloud native journey with their first step being use of containers, and taking a second step, moved into container orchestration as their workloads grew. Now, waves and waves of organizations are considering service meshes as their third significant step in their cloud native journey. As they invest into service meshes as their next layer of key infrastructure, users will continue to look for the same assurances sought from other commonly accepted (standard) interfaces for container runtimes (e.g. CRI), container storage (e.g. CSI), container networking (e.g. CNI) and they will look for a commonly accepted service mesh interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a prominent supporter of management software for multiple service meshes, Layer5 is pleased to partner with Microsoft in support of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://smi-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface&lt;/a&gt; (SMI). The Service Mesh Interface is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. As such, SMI defines a common standard that can be implemented by a variety of service mesh projects and vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like standards before SMI, consistent APIs inspire confidence in infrastructure stability, community-managed APIs assuage technology and vendor lock-in concerns, and steward the resounding of core use cases, resulting in streamlining the smaller, but critical-to-users, subset of capabilities offered across the &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/landscape&quot;&gt;service mesh landscape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery and SMI are aligned on common goals of getting users started quickly, understanding that users want service mesh technology, but have questions as to which service mesh use, how, and when to get started through a common interface. Meshery’s playground capabilities quick provision a variety of service meshes and reduce time to value and time to understanding for those adopting a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a multi-mesh manager, Meshery, understands that each service mesh has it own strengths. SMI intends to allow for differentiation by service mesh providers, at the same time providing interoperability between service meshes and their surrounding tooling. As a management plane, Meshery enhances networking intelligence in a multi-mesh way, encouraging users to expect more from their infrastructure. Meshery exposes each service mesh’s differentiated capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMI’s aim for consistent APIs facilitates Meshery’s same goals, allowing for users and tools to flourish. As SMI unveils today, so does Meshery’s compatibility.
