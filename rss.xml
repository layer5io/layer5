On one side, verbose logs, relics of our debugging days, threaten to devour production budgets.  On the other, traces, the Sherlock Holmes of observability, offer targeted insights but come with their own complexities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signals have different ways to be collected/instrumented. They also have different resource costs to obtain, store, and analyze, while providing different ways to observe the same system. Choosing between them, or all of them, is a game of trade-offs like all other tasks in engineering. In the next sections, we’ll help you make this decision by digging deeper into each signal, starting with the most popular ones: metrics, logs and traces, and then the two new possible signals: application profiles and crash dumps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Logpocalypse Looms:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that single log statement you sprinkled in development?  Imagine it bombarded with millions of hits daily in production.  The cost implications are staggering.  Are we clinging to outdated habits, drowning in a sea of irrelevant data?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div quote=&quot;Log levels area a Band-Aid, not a cure.&quot; person=&quot;Lee Calcote&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log levels offer some relief, silencing the noise in production.  But what if that critical error gets buried under an avalanche of info logs?  Is there a risk of sacrificing valuable insights for a false sense of cost control?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traces: A Targeted Approach Emerges:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traces offer a compelling alternative.  They map a request&amp;#x27;s journey through your system, meticulously recording events and their connections.  This targeted approach inherently generates less data, making them potentially cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing offers the ability to granularly track request segments (spans) as the request is processed across various services. It is hard to introduce later, one reason being third party libraries that are used by the application also need to be instrumented. The cost of distributed tracing can be high, and so, most service mesh tracing systems employ various forms of sampling to capture only a certain portion of the observed traces. When traces are sampled performance overhead and storage costs are reduced, but so is your visibility. The rate at which sampling is done is a balance between the frequency by which traces are captured (typically expressed as a percentage in relation to service request volume). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure: Cost vs. Value Spectrum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/comparative-cost-of-observability-signals-75d487120df6091e4dd1ac12618bf9c5.png&quot; class=&quot;image-center-shadow&quot; style=&quot;width:70%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure: a comparative spectrum of value provided by and cost of each pillar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure above presents a visual spectrum that acknowledges that collecting telemetry in production is a compromise between cost in terms of storage and performance (CPU, memory, and request latency) overhead, and the value of information collection, typically in terms of how expressiveness it is or useful it is in solving puzzles of slow or errored responses.
It’s argued that metrics provide the highest value for the smallest investment. Given that some service meshes facilitate distributed tracing, an argument that distributed tracing provides the highest value and can be achieved at low investment (relative to the amount of insight provided). Ideally, your instrumentation allows you to dial back the verbosity levels and sampling rate to facilitate control over your overhead costs vs desired observability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We won&amp;#x27;t dive into metrics as a signal in this post, but will ackowledge their use and validaty in the converation.  Metrics also represent point in time observations of the state of a system. This differs from logs or traces, which focus on records or information about individual events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Power of Smart Sampling&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all traces are created equal.  Simple sampling techniques can leave you blindsided.  The key lies in dynamic/adaptive tail sampling – a detective sniffing out the real clues in a crime scene, focusing on the most valuable traces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Smart Sampling with Jaeger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#x27;ve established that simple, &amp;quot;dumb&amp;quot; sampling techniques for traces can leave you blindsided. Imagine a scenario in Jaeger, a popular distributed tracing platform, where every trace has a 10% chance of being captured, regardless of content. Crucial errors with low occurrence might slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where dynamic/adaptive tail sampling, a champion feature of Jaeger, enters the scene, offering a more intelligent approach. Here&amp;#x27;s how it works within the Jaeger ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaeger&amp;#x27;s Collector Takes Center Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;  As traces flow into your Jaeger collector, it doesn&amp;#x27;t make a snap decision about sampling.  Instead, it analyzes key characteristics of each trace using Jaeger&amp;#x27;s robust sampling framework. This might include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Span Duration:&lt;/strong&gt;  Did a particular span within the trace take an exceptionally long time, indicating a potential bottleneck in a specific service?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Tags:&lt;/strong&gt;  Did any spans within the trace contain error tags, suggesting something went wrong?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Names:&lt;/strong&gt;  Was a specific service involved in the trace that&amp;#x27;s known to be error-prone based on historical data?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritizing the Catch:&lt;/strong&gt;  Based on analysis, the Jaeger collector assigns a sampling probability to each trace.  Traces with characteristics suggesting valuable insights (e.g., slow spans, errors) will have a higher chance of being captured. On the other hand, common, routine traces might be sampled at a lower rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jaeger Detective at Work:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of Jaeger&amp;#x27;s dynamic/adaptive tail sampling as a detective sifting through a crime scene. They don&amp;#x27;t blindly collect every span within every trace.  Instead, they prioritize clues based on their potential significance – error tags within a span get captured with a higher probability than a normal database access span in a healthy service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This intelligent approach ensures you capture the valuable traces while keeping the cost under control. But even with Jaeger, there are good and bad practices to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Practice: Sampling Everything (Jaeger YAML configuration):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(99, 119, 119);font-style:italic&quot;&gt;# This configuration captures EVERY trace, defeating the purpose of sampling.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;sampler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; probabilistic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token key atrule&quot;&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(247, 140, 108)&quot;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good Practice: Prioritize Errors (Jaeger YAML configuration):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token comment&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(99, 119, 119);font-style:italic&quot;&gt;# This leverages Jaeger&amp;#x27;s ability to identify traces with errors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot; style=&quot;display:inline-block&quot;&gt;

Here&amp;#x27;s how to leverage it with best practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install the Jaeger Operator:&lt;/strong&gt;  Follow the official guide to install the Jaeger Operator in your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Define Jaeger CRDs with Sampling Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt;  Use Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) provided by the operator to configure your Jaeger instance. Within the CRD YAML, define the &lt;code&gt;sampler&lt;/code&gt; section as shown in the good practice example above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tailor Sampling for Specific Services:&lt;/strong&gt;  The Jaeger Operator allows granular control over sampling strategies. You can define specific sampling probabilities for individual services within your application landscape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond the Basics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaeger&amp;#x27;s dynamic/adaptive tail sampling offers a robust configuration system. You can define custom sampling strategies based on specific service names, tags, or even regular expressions within your traces. This granular control empowers you to tailor the sampling process to your unique application landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaeger: Ideal, or Not Quite?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaeger is a powerful tool for distributed tracing, but it&amp;#x27;s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Here&amp;#x27;s a quick reflection:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengths:&lt;/strong&gt; Jaeger excels at cost-effective observability with its smart sampling and ease of use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Considerations:&lt;/strong&gt; While Jaeger offers flexibility, configuration can become complex for intricate setups. Additionally, Jaeger itself requires some infrastructure overhead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Takeaway:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By embracing Jaeger&amp;#x27;s smart sampling techniques and leveraging the Jaeger Tracing Operator for best-practice deployments, you can move beyond the reactive &amp;quot;log everything&amp;quot; mentality and enter a new era of cost-conscious, insightful monitoring. Remember, the ideal tool depends on your specific needs. Explore your options – Jaeger might be your perfect partner, or it might be the first step on your journey to finding the ideal distributed tracing solution for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Future of Observability Beckons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of observability isn&amp;#x27;t about logs versus traces.  It&amp;#x27;s about embracing a proactive approach.  &lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#x27;s time to move beyond the reactive &amp;quot;log everything&amp;quot; mentality.&lt;/strong&gt;  By adopting smarter practices, we can create a future where observability doesn&amp;#x27;t break the bank.  Let&amp;#x27;s ditch the cost-prohibitive logpocalypse and unlock the power of targeted, insightful monitoring. The choice is clear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Simplify Multi-container Application Management with the Docker Meshery Extension]]></title><description><![CDATA[Simplify Multi-container Application Management with the Docker Meshery Extension]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/docker/simplify-multi-container-application-management-with-the-docker-meshery-extension</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/docker/simplify-multi-container-application-management-with-the-docker-meshery-extension</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Layer5 Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 25 Apr 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/c7a2abd06dcfa5a17ef79309fbcb392e/dockercompose-logo.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experience the power and ease of the Docker Meshery Extension.

The primary objectives include identifying bottlenecks, measuring performance, and gaining insights into how the system operates under extreme conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load tests empower developers to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Understand the scalability of the application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Identify and rectify bottlenecks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure reliability and robustness of the application&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predict system behavior under varying conditions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; Load Generator&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s delve into Meshery, a multi-Cloud Native management plane founded by &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt;—a community dedicated to open-source initiatives in network management and observability. Meshery aids developers in assessing the performance of their Cloud Native applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meshery boasts a comprehensive set of features, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cloud Native Lifecycle Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Configuration management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting various load generators like HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/projects/nighthawk&quot;&gt;Nighthawk&lt;/a&gt; and its built-in load generator, Meshery facilitates the creation of synthetic HTTP load and enables benchmarking the performance of Cloud Native applications.
Developers can choose their preferred load generator for tests and benefit from the capability to run tests, providing a more comprehensive performance analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Meshery, developers can:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage the lifecycle of various &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt; applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conduct performance tests and compare results between across different &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt; environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply custom or pre-defined configurations to enhance &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Cloud Native&lt;/a&gt; functionality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Load Balancing&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing is a critical technique that enhances the responsiveness, reliability, and scalability of applications by efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers. In this guide, we&amp;#x27;ll explore various load balancing techniques and algorithms, shedding light on their roles, benefits, and challenges in the context of Kubernetes networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction: The Crucial Role of Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing plays a pivotal role in optimizing the performance of internet applications by efficiently managing network traffic. Imagine a grocery store with multiple checkout lines—one open and the others closed. Load balancing is akin to opening all checkout lines,thereby reducing wait times, and improving overall efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption fig-right&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/Layer5.e3b47339.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Load Balancing Works:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing involves three main components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Balancer:&lt;/strong&gt; Positioned between users and application servers, it monitors incoming traffic and redirects it to the most suitable server. It can be hardware-based or software-based, with the latter running on existing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Application Servers:&lt;/strong&gt; These servers host applications, receiving traffic from the load balancer and serving requested content to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users:&lt;/strong&gt; End-users access applications through the internet or intranet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user initiates a request, the load balancer evaluates factors such as server capacity, usage rate, and response time to determine the optimal server. This process enhances efficiency and reduces user wait times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Load Balancers: Performance, Reliability, and Scalability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Performance:&lt;/strong&gt; By distributing workloads evenly, response time and system latency are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Reliability:&lt;/strong&gt; Fault tolerance is enhanced by detecting and removing failed or unhealthy servers,redirecting traffic to functional servers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt; The system&amp;#x27;s capacity can be horizontally scaled by adding more servers without impacting existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Costs:&lt;/strong&gt; Efficient resource utilization avoids underutilization or overprovisioning of servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Load Balancing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery  serves as a platform for managing various Cloud Native applications . While it doesn&amp;#x27;t directly perform load balancing directly, Meshery allows users to configure and observe load balancing within their chosen Cloud Native Adaptors. Through a unified dashboard, users can customize load balancing settings, monitor relevant metrics, and leverage observability tools to gain insights into the performance and health of load balancing features. Meshery&amp;#x27;s focus is on providing a consistent and user-friendly interface for Cloud Native Lifecycle Management, including load balancing configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adapters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/istio&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/linkerd&quot;&gt;Linkerd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul&quot;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/nsm&quot;&gt;Network Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Types of Load Balancers in Kubernetes: Service, Ingress, and External&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Service Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; This basic Kubernetes tactic routes all requests to a service and directs them to matching pods. It&amp;#x27;s suitable for cluster-internal traffic but lacks advanced features like SSL termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingress Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Handling external traffic, it routes requests based on rules defined in an ingress resource. It offers more flexibility and functionality, including SSL termination and authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External Load Balancing:&lt;/strong&gt; Involving external load balancers from cloud providers (AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancer), it provides layer-4 or layer-7 load balancing and high availability. However, it adds complexity and additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Challenges of Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its advantages, load balancing comes with challenges such as the need for careful configuration to address specific application requirements and potential complexities in managing dynamic workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Load Balance Algorithms: Static and Dynamic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Static Load Balancing Algorithms:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round Robin:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributes requests sequentially across servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hash:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributes requests based on a key, such as client IP address or request URL.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Random:&lt;/strong&gt; Distributes requests randomly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithms:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least Connections:&lt;/strong&gt; Directs requests to the server with the fewest active connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least Response Time:&lt;/strong&gt; Considers active connections and average response time to determine the optimal server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least Bandwidth:&lt;/strong&gt; Routes requests to the server with the least traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right Load Balancer: Tips and Considerations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider factors like application needs, performance requirements, and scalability when selecting a load balancer—whether hardware, software, or a combination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: Empowering Applications with Optimal Load Balancing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balancing is a powerful technique that significantly impacts the performance, reliability, and scalability of applications. Whether distributing workloads based on static or dynamic algorithms, choosing the right load balancing strategy is crucial for delivering an exceptional user experience and optimizing resources. As technologies evolve, staying informed about the latest load balancing practices ensures continuous improvement in application delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comparing Meshery Models and Meshery Designs]]></title><description><![CDATA[Understanding the difference between Meshery Models and Meshery Designs]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/comparing-meshery-models-and-meshery-designs</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/comparing-meshery-models-and-meshery-designs</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 27 Mar 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/849957f6f940bb09802455b7e7411be8/five-legos.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Meshery, two key concepts play a pivotal role in managing infrastructure and deployments: Meshery Models and Meshery Designs. Understanding their difference and their similarities will greatly increase your benefit from these two powerful, systems management paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt;Meshery Models&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt; Meshery Designs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/designs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meshery Designs&lt;/a&gt; are the practical implementations based on Meshery Models. They represent declarations of your infrastructure deployments, customized according to specific use cases, environments, and requirements. Meshery Designs allow you to create, manage, and deploy complex architectures seamlessly, leveraging the power and flexibility of Meshery Models as their foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/five-legos-94699efabf99f5f9208a161510500a42.png&quot; width=&quot;50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meshery Models (similar to Lego bricks)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/models&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Models&lt;/a&gt; are standardized packages that bundle components and characterize their relationships. &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/logical/components&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Components&lt;/a&gt; are often representative of infrastructure, but can, in fact, represent anything (see semantically meaningful vs non-semantically meaingful components). Models uniformly wrap each component with a layer of metadata therein standardizing all entities (infrasturcture or otherwise) under a common interface much in the same way that the Industrial Revolution offered consistency of parts and interchangability of machinery, Meshery Components become fundamental building blocks. Components are like standard Lego bricks, window pieces, wheels that all snap together - or don&amp;#x27;t - depending upon way in which they relate to one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As versioned and portable pacakges, Models provide a structured, reusable, and extensible way to represent infrastructure components and their relationships, going beyond just code. This enables a more flexible and adaptable approach to modeling complex systems. are powerful Relationships and policies. contain Components cannot be directly used to build something complete on their own, but are standardized and reused across different Lego sets (instructions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definition:&lt;/strong&gt; Building blocks for infrastructure definition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Describe how to manage specific infrastructure types and their interactions.&lt;img data-file-id=&quot;2445161&quot; height=&quot;223&quot; src=&quot;/static/five-legos-94699efabf99f5f9208a161510500a42.png&quot; style=&quot;border:0px;width:300px;height:223px;margin:0px&quot; width=&quot;300; box-shadow: none;&quot; class=&quot;image-right-no-shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content:&lt;/strong&gt; Define properties, capabilities, and relationships for infrastructure components.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Usability:&lt;/strong&gt; Not directly deployable, but used as building blocks within Designs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing:&lt;/strong&gt; Can be packaged and shared for others to use in their Designs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery Models are like the individual Lego bricks - they define the building blocks for infrastructure with specific characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;margin-top:1.2rem&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meshery Designs (similar to Lego instructions)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery Designs provide a collaborative blueprint for building a specific model using Lego bricks (Meshery Models).

With Docker as the most popular container engine and image format, but not the only runtime or format, the need for a standardized format to store and distribute container images became apparent and is why the &lt;a href=&quot;https://opencontainers.org&quot;&gt;Open Container Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (OCI) image format comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OCI was established as a community-driven initiative to create open standards for container formats and runtimes. Its goal is to promote interoperability and ensure that containers can be used across different platforms and runtime environments. One of the key components of the OCI initiative is the OCI image format, which has been widely adopted by container registries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why have container registries have embraced the OCI format? How does Meshery, a popular internal developer platform, leverage this format for pushing and pulling design patterns? By understanding the benefits of OCI format for container registries and Meshery&amp;#x27;s support for it, we can gain valuable insights into the advantages of using this standardized format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Container Registries Use OCI Format&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Container registries play a crucial role in the container ecosystem, serving as repositories for storing and distributing container images. These images are the building blocks of containerized applications, containing everything needed to run an application, from the code to the dependencies and configurations. In recent years, container registries have widely adopted the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format as the standard for packaging and distributing container images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benefits of OCI Format&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adoption of OCI format by container registries offers several compelling benefits. Firstly, the OCI format provides a standardized and vendor-neutral way to package and distribute container images. This standardization ensures that images created using one container runtime can be run using a different runtime without any compatibility issues. This portability not only enhances interoperability but also encourages collaboration and innovation within the container ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the OCI format promotes transparency and openness. It allows developers and users to inspect and understand the contents of a container image easily. By providing a clear structure for storing metadata and file system layers, the OCI format enables greater visibility into the image&amp;#x27;s composition, making it easier to identify potential security vulnerabilities or licensing issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Interoperability with Different Container Runtimes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key reason why container registries prefer the OCI format is its compatibility with various container runtimes. Since container runtimes are responsible for executing the container images, it is crucial to have a format that can work seamlessly across different runtime environments. The OCI format achieves this by defining a set of specifications that are implemented by various container runtimes like Docker, containerd, and CRI-O. This compatibility ensures that container images stored in OCI format can be executed on different runtimes, giving developers the flexibility to choose the runtime that best suits their needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security and Trustworthiness&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is a top concern for container registries, and the OCI format offers robust security features. By adhering to the OCI format, container registries can leverage the security mechanisms provided by OCI specifications. These mechanisms include content-addressable storage, which ensures that the integrity of the image is maintained throughout its lifecycle, and digital signatures, which enable image verification and establish trust between the registry and the consumers. The use of the OCI format adds an additional layer of trustworthiness to container images, assuring users that the images have not been tampered with and come from a trusted source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Meshery Design Patterns Utilize OCI Format&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introduction to Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery, an open-source service mesh management plane, has rapidly gained popularity among developers and operators for its ability to simplify and streamline the deployment, management, and observability of service meshes. One of the key features that sets Meshery apart is its utilization of the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format for pushing and pulling design patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Advantages of Pushing and Pulling Design Patterns in OCI Format&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the OCI format for design patterns offers several advantages for Meshery users. Firstly, it ensures that design patterns can be easily shared and reused across different container runtimes, regardless of the specific implementation details. This interoperability simplifies the process of deploying applications on various platforms, eliminating the need for time-consuming modifications and customizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the OCI format enhances security and trustworthiness by providing a standardized and verifiable way to package and distribute design patterns. By utilizing cryptographic signing, developers can ensure the integrity and authenticity of the design patterns they push and pull from container registries. This prevents tampering and reduces the risk of running malicious or compromised design patterns, enhancing the overall security posture of applications deployed using Meshery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another advantage of the OCI format is its ability to encapsulate not only the application code but also the underlying dependencies and runtime environment. This self-contained nature simplifies the process of distributing and maintaining design patterns, as all the necessary components are bundled together. It also allows for more consistent and reproducible deployments, ensuring that the design pattern behaves consistently regardless of the environment in which it is deployed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CTA_FullWidth__CTA_FullWidthWrapper-sc-1rsxguj-0 yZijj&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/meshery-logo-shadow-31f973a6d26622a1ce1dedba0b889cfa.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Meshery is a self-service engineering platform.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cta-content&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where DevOps Collaborates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 kpjYoD appion__btn&quot; title=&quot;See Meshery&quot;&gt; See Meshery&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;## Meshery&amp;#x27;s Support for OCI Format&lt;p&gt;Meshery fully embraces the use of OCI format for pushing and pulling design patterns.

This collaborative environment promotes knowledge sharing, reduces duplication of effort, and facilitates efficient problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cost savings: Building on a solid platform foundation reduces development costs by eliminating the need to reinvent the wheel for each application. Additionally, platforms enable organizations to leverage economies of scale by sharing resources and infrastructure across multiple applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, platform engineering also presents its own set of challenges, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complexity: Building and maintaining a platform can be complex due to the interdependencies between various components and the need for integration with other systems. It requires a deep understanding of the underlying technologies and the ability to manage and mitigate potential risks and issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous evolution: Platforms need to evolve continuously to keep up with changing technologies and user needs. This requires a proactive approach to stay updated with emerging trends, evaluate new tools and frameworks, and invest in ongoing maintenance and upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next section, we will delve into the process of designing and building a platform, exploring the key considerations, requirements, and tools involved in the platform engineering journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;CTA_FullWidth__CTA_FullWidthWrapper-sc-1rsxguj-0 yZijj&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/meshery-logo-shadow-31f973a6d26622a1ce1dedba0b889cfa.webp&quot; alt=&quot;Meshery is a self-service engineering platform.&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;cta-content&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where DevOps Collaborates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud and cloud native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;btnstyle__ButtonStyle-sc-mhxpaj-0 kpjYoD appion__btn&quot; title=&quot;See Meshery&quot;&gt; See Meshery&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Designing and Building a Platform&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a platform is a crucial step in platform engineering. It requires careful consideration of various factors to ensure a robust and scalable infrastructure that meets the needs of the organization and its users. In this section, we will explore the key aspects of designing and building a platform, including identifying platform requirements, architectural considerations, and the tools and technologies involved in platform development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Identifying Platform Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting the design and development process, it is essential to identify the specific requirements of the platform. This involves understanding the goals and objectives of the platform, as well as the target audience and their needs. By clearly defining the requirements, platform engineers can make informed decisions throughout the development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform requirements can vary significantly depending on the industry and organization. For example, an e-commerce platform may need to handle high volumes of traffic and transactions, while a healthcare platform may require stringent security and privacy measures. It is important to consider factors such as scalability, performance, security, integration capabilities, and user experience when determining the platform requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Architectural Considerations for Platform Design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the requirements are in place, the next step is to determine the architectural design of the platform. The architecture serves as the blueprint for the platform and guides the development process. It defines the structure, components, and interactions within the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various architectural patterns to consider, such as monolithic, microservices, serverless, and container-based architectures. Each pattern has its own advantages and trade-offs, and the choice depends on factors like scalability, flexibility, maintainability, and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, platform engineers need to consider factors such as data storage and management, communication protocols, integration with external systems, and fault tolerance. These considerations ensure that the platform is designed to handle the expected workload and can adapt to future needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tools and Technologies for Platform Development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a platform requires the use of various tools and technologies that facilitate the development process. These tools range from integrated development environments (IDEs) to version control systems, testing frameworks, and deployment automation tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the chosen architecture and requirements, platform engineers may utilize technologies like cloud computing platforms, containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, programming languages such as Java, Python, or JavaScript, and frameworks like Spring Boot or Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is crucial for platform engineers to stay updated with the latest tools and technologies in the industry. This enables them to leverage the most efficient and effective solutions for platform development, ensuring optimal performance, scalability, and maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By carefully considering platform requirements, architectural design, and utilizing appropriate tools and technologies, platform engineers can build a robust and scalable platform that meets the organization&amp;#x27;s needs. In the next section, we will explore the operational aspects of platform engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Operating and Maintaining a Platform&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating and maintaining a platform is crucial for ensuring its continued functionality, scalability, and security. This section will explore the key aspects of managing a platform&amp;#x27;s infrastructure, monitoring its performance, and ensuring security and compliance in its operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Managing Platform Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing the infrastructure of a platform involves various tasks, such as provisioning and configuring servers, managing databases, and deploying software updates. It is essential to have a robust infrastructure management strategy to ensure the platform&amp;#x27;s stability and availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key considerations in managing platform infrastructure is scalability. As the platform grows and user demands increase, the infrastructure must be able to handle the load efficiently. This may involve scaling up the existing infrastructure or adopting cloud-based solutions to ensure flexibility and elasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, effective resource allocation is critical for optimizing platform performance and cost-efficiency. By monitoring resource utilization and performance metrics, platform engineers can identify bottlenecks and allocate resources accordingly, ensuring optimal use of available infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Platform Monitoring and Performance Optimization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring the platform&amp;#x27;s performance is essential for identifying and resolving issues proactively. Platform engineers employ various monitoring tools and techniques to track key performance indicators, such as response time, resource utilization, and availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time monitoring enables the early detection of performance degradation or system failures, allowing platform engineers to take immediate action to mitigate the impact on users. Moreover, historical performance data can provide valuable insights for capacity planning and future optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance optimization involves fine-tuning the platform to enhance its efficiency and responsiveness. This may include optimizing database queries, improving caching mechanisms, or implementing load balancing techniques. Regular performance testing and profiling can uncover potential bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ensuring Security and Compliance in Platform Operations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security and compliance are paramount in platform operations, especially when dealing with sensitive data or regulated industries. Platform engineers must implement robust security measures to protect the platform and its users from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may involve implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and regularly patching and updating software components to address security vulnerabilities. Additionally, platform engineers should establish strict access control policies and regularly audit system logs for any suspicious activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compliance with industry regulations and standards is also essential for platform operations. Platform engineers must stay updated with the latest compliance requirements and ensure that the platform meets the necessary standards. This may involve conducting regular audits, documenting compliance processes, and implementing necessary controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating and maintaining a platform requires diligent attention to infrastructure management, performance monitoring, and security and compliance practices. By focusing on these key aspects, platform engineers can ensure the platform&amp;#x27;s stability, scalability, and data integrity, ultimately providing a reliable and secure experience for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, platform engineering plays a crucial role in the development and success of any digital product or service. By providing a robust and scalable foundation, platform engineering enables organizations to accelerate their innovation, streamline operations, and enhance customer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout this article, we have explored the fundamentals of platform engineering, including its definition, importance, and key concepts. We have also discussed the benefits and challenges associated with platform engineering, recognizing that while it offers numerous advantages, it requires careful planning, design, and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designing and building a platform necessitates a thorough understanding of the requirements and architectural considerations. By leveraging the right tools and technologies, organizations can create a platform that aligns with their goals and objectives, while also ensuring flexibility and scalability to accommodate future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operating and maintaining a platform demands ongoing management of the infrastructure, including continuous monitoring and performance optimization. Organizations must also prioritize security and compliance to safeguard sensitive data and ensure regulatory adherence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platform engineering is a dynamic and ever-evolving field, driven by the rapid advancements in technology and the changing needs of businesses and consumers. As organizations embrace digital transformation and seek to stay competitive in the digital age, platform engineering will continue to play a pivotal role in delivering innovative solutions and driving business success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, platform engineering is the backbone of modern-day digital products and services. It empowers organizations to build, operate, and maintain robust platforms that can support their business objectives, enhance customer experiences, and drive growth. By understanding the fundamentals, embracing best practices, and staying abreast of emerging trends, organizations can leverage platform engineering to unlock their full potential in an increasingly digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Kubernetes 1.29 improves open source cloud native production readiness]]></title><link>https://layer5.io/company/news/how-kubernetes-129-improves-open-source-cloud-native-production-readiness</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/company/news/how-kubernetes-129-improves-open-source-cloud-native-production-readiness</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[SDxCentral]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/93e14b4ec9a424898cd9cfea9fe4c089/kubernetes-1-29.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Newsstyle__NewsWrapper-sc-12r6uiw-0 DQvaY&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open source Kubernetes cloud native project is out today with release of version 1.29, codenamed Mandala. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes 1.29 milestone is the final release for 2023 for the open source cloud native technology and introduces a range of new features and enhancements. Kubernetes has multiple updates this year, the new release follows the Kubernetes 1.28 update that came out in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the “Mandala” release after the cosmic circular artwork, Kubernetes v1.29 reflects the project’s interconnected community of contributors. The release was shepherded by a 40-person release team and saw participation from 888 companies and 1,422 individuals over 14 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the major additions in this version are 11 features promoted to stable release status for general availability. This includes the new ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode that ensures only one pod can read/write a volume, node volume expansion secret support for container storage interface (CSI)  drivers and encryption at rest using KMS v2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen features have entered beta, highlighting improvements to scheduling, node lifecycle management  and cleaning up legacy service account tokens. Some of the new alpha functionality includes better pod affinity rules, an nftables backend for kube-proxy networking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking improvements in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.29 multiple networking improvements. The new Kubernetes release will be the first to benefit from the new gateway API that helps to improve overall connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidecar containers also get a major boost. &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote/bio&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;/company/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and a CNCF contributor told  SDxCentral that Kubernetes 1.28 introduced the concept of a sidecar container – a restartable init container. The concept of a sidecar has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. He noted that sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies in service meshes or for logging or running other auxiliary services to the main container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until 1.28, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support, and beginning now in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers, the kubelet (Kubernete node agent) will delay sending a termination signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated,” Calcote said. “Also new in 1.29 is the behavior of sidecar containers being terminated in reverse of the order in which they were initialized, so that they may continue to offer their services up to the very end of the Pod’s lifecycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kubernetes 1.29 Highlights, Features, and Deprecations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Release Notes: What changed in Kubernetes 1.29?]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/kubernetes-new.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the final Kubernetes release of 2023, Kubernetes 1.29 is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/&quot;&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt; of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/cloud-native-performance&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt;. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kubernetes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of enhancements tracked in this release (72), you need to be aware that a number of these are code freezes or deprecations in 1.29. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, and important deprecations, so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s breakdown new K8s features between networking and security categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Networking in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io&quot;&gt;Gateway API reaches 1.0&lt;/a&gt; [Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway API has reached v1.0 in between Kubernetes 1.28 and 1.29. The Gateway API is the eventual successor to the Ingress API and significantly augments the Service API. The Kubernetes Service API is one of the oldest and most used APIs in Kubernetes. The Service API, in fact, was present in the very first public commit of Kubernetes in 2014, and almost everyone who deploys workloads in Kubernetes ends up using Services. Nearly ten years later in 2024, While Service API offers a kitchen sink full of functionality, it’s nearly ten year old design is limiting what can be done in Kubernetes networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway API takes a fresh approach in offering expressive, extensible, and role-oriented interfaces. Gateway API is expressive and extensible in that it offers core support for advanced traffic management (like traffic weighting, header-based matching) that is only possible through customizations in Ingress API. Gateway API is role-oriented in that it defines three main roles: infrastructure provider, cluster operator, and application developer, who need to work together to use and configure Kubernetes service networking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753&quot;&gt;Sidecar Containers&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new sidecar feature enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support. The lack of native support has caused some usage friction, which this enhancement aims to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new feature adds a new restartPolicy field to init containers that is available when the SidecarContainers feature gate is enabled. The field is optional and, if set, the only valid value is Always. Setting this field changes the behavior of init containers as follows: The container restarts if it exits. Any subsequent init container starts immediately after the startupProbe has successfully completed instead of waiting for the restartable init container to exit. The resource usage calculation changes for the pod as restartable init container resources are now added to the sum of the resource requests by the main containers. Pod termination continues to only depend on the main containers. An init container with a restartPolicy of Always (named a sidecar) won’t prevent the pod from terminating after the main containers exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers (init containers with an Always restart policy), the kubelet will delay sending the TERM signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated. The sidecar containers will be terminated in the reverse order they are defined in the Pod spec. This ensures that sidecar containers continue serving the other containers in the Pod until they are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior of this beta capability in 1.29 is that sidecar containers that have a &lt;code&gt;PreStop&lt;/code&gt; hook will be notified when the Pod has begun terminating by executing the &lt;code&gt;PreStop&lt;/code&gt; hook. Once the last primary container terminates, the last started sidecar container is notified by sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt; signal. The next sidecar (in reverse order) is notified by sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt; signal after the previous sidecar container terminates. This continues until all sidecar containers have terminated, or the Pod’s termination grace period expires. In the latter case, all remaining containers are notified by a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a fixed grace period of 2 seconds and finally terminated. The Pod will be terminated after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that slow termination of a main container will also delay the termination of the sidecar containers. If the grace period expires before the termination process is complete, the Pod may enter emergency termination. In this case, all remaining containers in the Pod will be terminated simultaneously with a short grace period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the Pod has a &lt;code&gt;preStop&lt;/code&gt; hook that exceeds the termination grace period, emergency termination may occur. In general, if you have used &lt;code&gt;preStop&lt;/code&gt; hooks to control the termination order without sidecar containers, you can now remove them and allow the kubelet to manage sidecar termination automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4006-transition-spdy-to-websockets&quot;&gt;Transition SPDY to WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change aims to deprecate SPDY in favor of WebSockets for Kubernetes API server communications. WebSockets provide a more modern and scalable protocol that can improve the overall reliability and maintainability of Kubernetes communications. This can enhance security by making sure that the communication protocols used by Kubernetes are robust and well-supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These general enhancements contribute to a more secure and efficient Kubernetes environment. By improving Kubernetes’ underlying reliability, performance, and operational control, the above features lay the groundwork for a more secure infrastructure platform capable of hosting sensitive and critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Security in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2535-ensure-secret-pulled-images&quot;&gt;Ensure Secret Pulled Images&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Container images often contain sensitive components, making the security of image pull operations critical. The new alpha feature makes sure that images are always pulled using Kubernetes secrets of the Pod using them. This is important when Kubelet pulls an image for one Pod and another Pod is pointing to the same image. Up until now, the second Pod’s image request did not need authentication since it still used the first one’s credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access. By securing the image pull process, this enhancement prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with container images, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031&quot;&gt;SignedSigning Release Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume&lt;/code&gt; has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2799-reduction-of-secret-based-service-account-token&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to “Bound Service Account Token Improvements” enhancement and narrowing the scope of service account tokens, this improvement seeks to reduce the reliance on long-lived secret-based service account tokens. By limiting the use of these tokens, the potential attack surface is significantly diminished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move aligns with the broader industry trend of short-lived, just-in-time credentials that minimize the chances of token leakage leading to unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3221-structured-authorization-configuration&quot;&gt;Structured Authentication Configuration&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the authorization counterpart, Kubernetes 1.29 provides another alpha feature for structured configuration for authentication mechanisms. This enhancement offers users a more maintainable and secure approach to managing authentication, allowing administrators to implement complex authentication schemes more efficiently and with less room for error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new enhancement, it is now possible to configure multiple OIDC providers, clients, and validation rules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endeavour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal. Dign into more details about deprecation, removals, and the latest changes in the 1.29 &lt;a href=&quot;https://relnotes.k8s.io/&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Layer5 community and all of the CNCF projects that its contributors steward, thank you to everyone who participated in this Kubernetes release, and congratulations! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#x27;s ahead for Kubernetes in 2024?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI/MLOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI came into the world with a big splash this year and helmsman, Kubernetes, is here helping navigate the AI waters. While some people suggest that the CNCF and Kubernetes ecosystem is in catch up mode in context of GenAI, they perhaps, forget that OpenAI is running a 7,500 node Kubernetes cluster in the development and hosting of GPT-3, CLIP, DALL·E, and research on other models. Where I think that Kubernetes and the CNCF can improve is in embracing and enabling AI/ML as a forerunner of our workload use cases. The CNCF has a massive developer ecosystem that will that can be enabled with MLOps and new model training projects like Kubeflow with its Kartib and KFServing sub-projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking past YAML&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DZone’s annual trend report on Kubernetes in the Enterprise has 55% of respondents identifying &amp;quot;Maintaining YAML files” as one of the more significant, ongoing pain-points in their experience with Kubernetes. In 2024, I’m looking forward to CNCF projects like Meshery addressing this pain-point with &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshmap&quot;&gt;a visual designer for Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; resource and workflow configuration. The inability for some developers to either be capable of or have time to comprehend the intricacies of their virtualized applications by staring at endless lines of YAML is poised to significantly improve in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Navigating Hacktoberfest]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to have a great Hacktoberfest experience and get the most out of participating]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/open-source/navigating-hacktoberfest</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/open-source/navigating-hacktoberfest</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/7e7878515bc5a64e27221318931fe2c6/layer5-hacktoberfest-2023.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the leaves begin to turn and the air grows crisp, it can only mean one thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.com&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; is here! This annual celebration of open source, hosted by Digital Ocean, invites contributors from all over the world to participate in a month-long extravaganza of code contributions. While the allure of limited-edition swag may be enticing, it&amp;#x27;s essential to approach Hacktoberfest with a mindset focused on quality, respect for maintainers, and a commitment to long-term community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 has a long history of participating in Hacktoberfest. 2023 is no different. Our annual &lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest kickoff and prep event&lt;/a&gt; (be sure to join) is tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Purposeful Participation: Beyond Swag Chasing and Profile Building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you embark on your Hacktoberfest journey, take a moment to reflect on your motivation. Are you here solely for the swag, just for the green boxes in your GitHub profile, or do you genuinely want to make a meaningful contribution to a project, learn, grow, and make new friends in the process? Embrace the opportunity to forge lasting connections and dive deeper into topics that resonate with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Quality Over Quantity: Making a Lasting Impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a flurry of pull requests may be impressive, maintainers value contributions that add genuine value. Think beyond code and consider how your unique skills—whether in design, organization, or other areas can enrich the project. Open Source thrives on meaningful contributions, so let&amp;#x27;s aim to make a tangible difference, rather than settling for mediocrity. You will grow in the process and so will the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-1yeq4hm-0 bwvwmu blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;blockquote-quote&quot;&gt;When you are clear about what motivates you, each contribution you make will help you achieve your goals, because you will be working on projects that are aligned with your values.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;blockquote-person&quot;&gt;— Lee Calcote&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;blockquote-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Guidelines Aren&amp;#x27;t Optional: Respecting the Playbook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That CONTRIBUTING.md file? It&amp;#x27;s not there for decoration. Treat it as your playbook, providing guidance for equitable collaboration. Ignoring these guidelines is akin to rearranging someone&amp;#x27;s furniture without permission. Established protocols are crucial, especially in projects with numerous contributors. They help navigate the intricacies of collaborative development. As an example, there is a full set of contributig docs written for Meshery - one for each component:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-gitflow&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery using git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/meshery-windows&quot;&gt;Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Build and Release (CI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cypress&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery&amp;#x27;s End-to-End Tests using Cypress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-adapters&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Adapters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docker-extension&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Docker Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-server&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-models&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-error&quot;&gt;How to write MeshKit compatible errors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui-notification-center&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery UI - Notification Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docs&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide&quot;&gt;Meshery CLI Contributing Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Upholding a Safe Environment: The Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect, collaboration, and kindness are the bedrock of Open Source. The Code of Conduct is non-negotiable, ensuring a secure and inclusive space for all contributors. Reporting mechanisms are in place to uphold these principles. As contributors, it is our duty to champion a culture of respect and security, nurturing an environment where creativity and innovation flourish. The &lt;a href=&quot;/community/handbook&quot;&gt;Layer5 Community Handbook&lt;/a&gt; offers an excellent reference for our community&amp;#x27;s culture norms and practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Engaging Beyond Code: Fostering Holistic Development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t confine yourself to a GitHub profile. Engage in meaningful discussions, participate in webinars, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.layer5.io&quot;&gt;open discussions&lt;/a&gt;. Be a mentor and seek mentorship. Open Source offers a wealth of opportunities for comprehensive growth. While coding skills undoubtedly benefit, the real lessons often lie in understanding people and their diverse perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Compassion Over Code: Recognizing Maintainer Burnout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/handbook/repository-overview&quot;&gt;Maintainers&lt;/a&gt; are the unsung heroes of the open-source world, often overwhelmed by the Hacktoberfest influx. Your seemingly &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; pull request may be the tipping point. Recognize their efforts and respect their capacity. Some projects may not actively seek new contributions, and that&amp;#x27;s perfectly valid. Begin by identifying projects explicitly welcoming newcomers, tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Alayer5labs+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;good first issue&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;help wanted&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. The Virtue of Patience: Embracing the Long Game&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source is a marathon, not a sprint. Feedback may take time, and collaboration may be challenging. Patience is the glue that holds this ecosystem together. Cultivate it as a fundamental habit in your contributor journey. The Layer5 &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members&quot;&gt;community members&lt;/a&gt; invest time, patience, understanding and offer endless hours of support to our contributors. Stick around and benefit. In turn, offer to help others. There&amp;#x27;s little better way to learn, than through teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Humility and Gratitude: The Essence of Meaningful Contributions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, a meaningful contribution is its own reward. Swag and a profile boost is a delightful bonus, not the end goal. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and learn from your experiences. As you recognize that you are part of a much larger movement, we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/community/layer5-recognition-program&quot;&gt;recognize our contributors and users milestones&lt;/a&gt; each step of the way.

Among the updates in Kubernetes 1.28 are enhancements designed to help with resiliency, including the ability to recover from non-graceful node shutdowns. There are also a series of networking-related enhancements that will enable better security and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the case with every Kubernetes release, there is a theme and a code name; for Kubernetes 1.28 the name is “Planternetes.” “So in the northern hemisphere, it’s summer right now and I think the symbolism of the garden and our community goes hand in hand,” Grace Nguyen, release lead for Kubernetes 1.28, told SDxCentral. “Each of us has a very important role in the ecosystem and together we built this big, open-source project that has a lot of impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking enhancements in Kubernetes 1.28&lt;/h3&gt;Looking specifically at the networking capabilities of Kubernetes 1.28, there are a few enhancements that will also help to improve overall performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote/bio&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and a CNCF contributor, explained that one of the key networking updates is an enhancement to the kube-proxy feature that will enable better connection-draining capabilities for load balancers targeting terminating nodes.&lt;p&gt;“This enhancement improves the reliability of load balancer health checks and connection draining for terminating nodes within Kubernetes, so that kube-proxy can independently report its health regardless of the terminating state of the node,” Calcote told SDxCentral. “In this way, cloud providers in particular can be more sophisticated in ascertaining if a load balancer should target a specific node for ingress traffic or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also of note in Kubernetes 1.28 for networking is IPv4 to IPv6 dual-stack transition support for Kubernetes pods. Calcote explained that this enhancement allows pods to access information about both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the node they are running on, thereby enhancing their ability to adapt to dual-stack network transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native networking beyond Kubernetes
While Kubernetes has many built-in capabilities, extensibility of the platform is a key attribute as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcote explained that proxies running in Kubernetes are quite powerful and many support on-the-fly insertion or removal of traffic filters as plugins, with technologies like Envoy, Traefik, and NGINX as prime examples. He noted that each technology varies in support for the chaining of multiple filters and for the programming languages in which developers can create these filters. Envoy, in particular, supports WebAssembly (WASM)-based filters, which means that a number of different languages are supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kubernetes has yet to address this deeper area of network traffic management, which is where CNCF projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; step in with WASM filter management for any Envoy proxy or Envoy-based service-mesh data plane,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.28 has deep roots for stability
Nguyen noted that there are some 45 enhancements in the Kubernetes 1.28 update, spanning new stable, beta and alpha capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is widely deployed on public cloud providers and is also used as the foundation of several commercial offerings, including one from IBM‘s Red Hat business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The latest release of Kubernetes has a number of enhancements to help increase the stability, performance and maintainability of the core platform while also augmenting workload innovation, including AI [artificial intelligence] and virtual machines,” Karena Angell, OpenShift Commons lead and senior principal product manager for Red Hat OpenShift and Hybrid Platforms, told SDxCentral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angell said Red Hat is particularly interested in the new node system memory swap support that has been added to Kubernetes 1.28 to enable better memory performance across a cluster. Additionally, she noted that the Kubernetes Job API now allows for more choices in AI model training and retraining, which is especially key for AI-driven and intelligent workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Kubernetes continues to mature as a platform with release 1.28, we’re very happy to see a number of new features and tweaks that further support production stability and consistency,” Angell said. “Large and complicated jobs can now fail faster and more accurately which, while it sounds strange, contributes to better overall performance of Kubernetes in production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layer5 💚's Open Source]]></title><description><![CDATA[HashiCorp Relicensing and Layer5's Partnership]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/announcements/layer5-s-open-source</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/announcements/layer5-s-open-source</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/72bc74d6687454f7700b4af70521f97a/layer5-open-source.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/10/2723189/0/en/HashiCorp-adopts-the-Business-Source-License-for-future-releases-of-its-products.html&quot;&gt;HashiCorp announced a change in their source code license&lt;/a&gt; from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) v1.1, effective in all future releases of HashiCorp’s core products, including Terraform, Vault, Consul, Boundary, Nomad, Waypoint, Packer, and Vagrant.

This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start&quot;&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt; on your local machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Create a Service Account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named &lt;code&gt;my-service-account&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Create a ClusterRole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#x27;s create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt; that has read-only access to Pods and Services:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

with the ClusterRole &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt;. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role-binding&lt;/code&gt; that associates the Service Account &lt;code&gt;my-service-account&lt;/code&gt; with the ClusterRole &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the &lt;code&gt;Subjects&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RoleRef&lt;/code&gt; sections, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kubernetes clusters&lt;/a&gt;. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Install Meshery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the official Meshery &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Access MeshMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://playground.meshery.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the &amp;quot;Generate Map&amp;quot; button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster&amp;#x27;s architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster&amp;#x27;s lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[HPE's Adoption of Layer5 Meshery and MeshMap]]></title><description><![CDATA[HPE uses Meshery to manage SPIRE instances]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/resources/case-study/hpes-adoption-of-meshery-and-meshmap</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/resources/case-study/hpes-adoption-of-meshery-and-meshmap</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Layer5 Team]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/91d038ef73208e4f202eecb42cb08c1f/meshery-and-hpe.svg" length="0" type="image/svg+xml"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Resourcesstyle__ResourcesWrapper-sc-1y33ukx-0 hKxBLf&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hpestyle__HPEintro-sc-1wo7snj-1 fECvio&quot;&gt;HPE&amp;#x27;s adoption of Meshery was driven by the need to simplify Kubernetes cluster management and monitoring.

and Development: HPE invests significantly in research and development to drive innovation. It operates HPE Labs, which focuses on developing cutting-edge technologies and solutions for the future.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPIRE is a toolchain of APIs for establishing trust between software systems across a wide variety of hosting platforms. SPIRE exposes the SPIFFE Workload API, which can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;hpestyle__HPEbenefits-sc-1wo7snj-2 bWNoXP&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meshery offers several benefits to HPE, including:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;✔️ Consistent service mesh management: HPE can now manage all their service meshes consistently, regardless of the underlying infrastructure or cloud provider.&lt;br/&gt;✔️ Improved observability: With Meshery&amp;#x27;s built-in visualization and observability tools, HPE can gain insights into the behavior of their service meshes, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.&lt;br/&gt;✔️ Simplified testing and validation: Meshery&amp;#x27;s service mesh validation capabilities enable HPE to easily test and validate their service meshes, ensuring that they meet their performance, security, and compliance requirements.&lt;br/&gt;✔️ Enhanced security: With Meshery&amp;#x27;s security features, HPE can ensure that their service meshes are secure and compliant with their organization&amp;#x27;s security policies.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Meshery has helped HPE to streamline their integration of the identity management control plane to reduce complexity, and improve the overall reliability and performance of their Kubernetes environment. SPIFFE is a set of open-source specifications for a framework capable of bootstrapping and issuing identity to services across heterogeneous environments and organizational boundaries. The lifecycle of SPIFFE identities, SVIDs, is managed by SPIRE, a production-ready implementation of the SPIFFE APIs that performs node and workload attestation in order to securely issue SVIDs to workloads, and verify the SVIDs of other workloads, based on a predefined set of conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HPE&amp;#x27;s adoption of Meshery has also been enhanced by the platform&amp;#x27;s ability to integrate with other popular technologies, such as SPIRE and Istio&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;display:flex;justify-content:center;align-item:center;padding:2%&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/meshery-integrations.e82003a0.svg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPIRE is an open-source project that provides a secure and scalable solution for service identity and authentication in distributed systems. HPE uses SPIRE to authenticate and authorize services in their Kubernetes environment, which ensures that only authorized services can communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery&amp;#x27;s integration with SPIRE enables HPE to manage SPIRE instances, issue and revoke service certificates, and automate the management of SPIRE agents across their Kubernetes clusters. This integration ensures that HPE&amp;#x27;s service meshes are secure, and only authorized services can communicate with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Inline-quotes__QuotesWrapper-sc-hv31e3-0 cRZWJU&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quote-box&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;❝ With a goal to bring workload identity and attestation to all service meshes, HPE Security Engineering uses the Meshery&amp;#x27;s Extension to deploy their cloud native infrastructure of choice and test the performance of our SPIFFE and SPIRE-based identity solution.

class=&quot;quote-source&quot;&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Maximiliano Churichi&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software Engineer at HPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, HPE&amp;#x27;s use of Meshery has been enhanced by its integration with Istio, an open-source service mesh that provides a comprehensive solution for traffic management, security, and observability in Kubernetes environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery&amp;#x27;s integration with Istio enables HPE to manage Istio service meshes and configurations, automate the deployment of Istio components, and monitor and visualize Istio metrics and traces. This integration enables HPE to simplify the management of their Istio service meshes, ensure their security and compliance, and gain insights into their behavior for better decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, HPE&amp;#x27;s adoption of Meshery, along with its integration with SPIRE and Istio, has enabled the company to streamline their service mesh management, ensure the security and compliance of their Kubernetes environment, and gain valuable insights into the behavior of their service meshes for improved performance and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Meshery also implements the Service Mesh Performance (SMP) specification&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMP is a community-driven effort that provides a standard for measuring and comparing the performance of different service meshes. It is designed to help users select the best service mesh for their needs by providing a common framework for benchmarking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Inline-quotes__QuotesWrapper-sc-hv31e3-0 cRZWJU&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;quote-box&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;❝ The Layer5 team has been amazing.

Users can select the service mesh they want to test, configure the test parameters (such as the number of requests per second and the number of concurrent clients), and run the test. Meshery will then generate a report that shows the performance metrics for each service mesh, such as latency, throughput, and error rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implementing SMP, Meshery provides a valuable tool for developers and operators who are evaluating different service meshes. Instead of having to create their own benchmarks, they can use SMP to get an objective and standardized view of each service mesh&amp;#x27;s performance characteristics. This can save a significant amount of time and effort, and help users make more informed decisions when choosing a service mesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, HPE&amp;#x27;s use of Meshery and the Docker Extension for Meshery demonstrates the power of cloud native technologies and the importance of open source collaboration. By leveraging these tools, HPE has been able to streamline its development and deployment processes, improve performance and security, and stay at the forefront of the cloud native movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Changing Meshery Release Channels]]></title><description><![CDATA[Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes being added regularly.

To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; How release channels offer subscription &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release Channels offers a subscription where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery. However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it&amp;#x27;s important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It&amp;#x27;s recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(255, 203, 139)&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;stable-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;edge-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel set stable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Switching between Release Channels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we&amp;#x27;ll cover both methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Meshconfig?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the &lt;code&gt;~/.meshery/config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl version&lt;/code&gt;. If you don&amp;#x27;t have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl&quot;&gt;Meshery documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create new Meshery config.yaml file &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-language=bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context create [context-name]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;Example: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes &lt;/code&gt;&lt;li&gt; To view the newly created meshery context use &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context view &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;context-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here&amp;#x27;s how:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/meshery-version-5dbe26bc558062b5cc58ff22a8e88b49.png&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will show you the currently channels ,&lt;b&gt;stable&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;edge&lt;/b&gt;, along with the version number and other information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus. To switch the channel to a specific version, replace &lt;b&gt;Version&lt;/b&gt; with the desired version number.&lt;li&gt; To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again: &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward process. You can do it using mesheryctl or by switching between your meshconfig file. Whether you want stable updates or bleeding-edge features, Meshery has a release channel that suits your needs. Just remember to carefully consider your use case and needs before making any changes to ensure that you have the best Meshery experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Configuring Highly Available Docker Swarm]]></title><link>https://layer5.io/resources/docker/configuring-highly-available-docker-swarm</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/resources/docker/configuring-highly-available-docker-swarm</guid><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/5b72df1802df0608ac6ee6e6bff70c9d/docker-swarm.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Resourcesstyle__ResourcesWrapper-sc-1y33ukx-0 hKxBLf&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Docker Swarm is a &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/kubernetes/management-of-kubernetes&quot;&gt;container orchestration&lt;/a&gt; tool that makes it easy to manage and scale your existing Docker infrastructure. It consists of a pool of Docker hosts that run in Swarm mode with some nodes acting as managers, workers, or both. Using Docker Swarm mode to manage your Docker containers brings the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It allows you to incrementally apply updates with zero downtime.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It increases application resilience to outages by reconciling any differences between the actual state and your expressed desired state.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It eases the process of scaling your applications since you only need to define the desired number of replicas in the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is built into the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; CLI, so you don&amp;#x27;t need additional software to get up and running.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It enables multi-host networking such that containers deployed on different nodes can communicate with each other easily.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you will learn key concepts in Docker Swarm and set up a highly available Swarm cluster that is resilient to failures. You will also learn some best practices and recommendations to ensure that your Swarm setup is fault tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure that you have access to five Ubuntu 22.04 servers. This is necessary to demonstrate a highly available set up, although it is also possible to run Docker Swarm on a single machine. You also need to configure each server with a user that has administrative privileges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following ports must also be available on each server for communication purposes between the nodes. On Ubuntu 22.04, they are open by default:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;TCP port 2377 for cluster management communications,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TCP and UDP port 7946 for communication among nodes,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TCP and UDP port 4789 for overlay network traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;explaining-docker-swarm-terminology&quot;&gt;Explaining Docker Swarm terminology&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding with this tutorial, let&amp;#x27;s examine some terms and definitions in Docker Swarm so that you have enough understanding of what each one means when they are used in this article and in other Docker Swarm resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Node&lt;/strong&gt;: refers to an instance of the Docker engine in the Swarm cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manager nodes&lt;/strong&gt;: they are tasked with handling orchestration and cluster management functions, and dispatching incoming tasks to worker nodes. They can also act as worker nodes unless placed in Drain mode (recommended).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leader&lt;/strong&gt;: this is a specific manager node that is elected to perform orchestration tasks and management/maintenance operations by all the manager nodes in the cluster using the &lt;a rel=&quot;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; class=&quot;whitespace-nowrap&quot; href=&quot;https://raft.github.io/&quot;&gt;Raft Consensus Algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worker nodes&lt;/strong&gt;: are Docker instances whose sole purpose is to receive and execute Swarm tasks from manager nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swarm task&lt;/strong&gt;: refers to a Docker container and the commands that run inside the container. Once a task is assigned to a node, it can run or fail but it cannot be transferred to a different node.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swarm service&lt;/strong&gt;: this is the mechanism for defining tasks that should be executed on a node. It involves specifying the container image and commands that should run inside the container.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drain&lt;/strong&gt;: means that new tasks are no longer assigned to a node, and existing tasks are reassigned to other available nodes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2 id=&quot;docker-swarm-requirements-for-high-availability&quot;&gt;Docker Swarm requirements for high availability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A highly available Docker Swarm setup ensures that if a node fails, services on the failed node are re-provisioned and assigned to other available nodes in the cluster. A Docker Swarm setup that consists of one or two manager nodes is not considered highly available because any incident will cause operations on the cluster to be interrupted. Therefore the minimum number of manager nodes in a highly available Swarm cluster should be three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table below shows the number of failures a Swarm cluster can tolerate depending on the number of manager nodes in the cluster:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Manager Nodes&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Failures tolerated&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, having an even number of manager nodes does not help with failure tolerance, so you should always maintain an odd number of manager nodes. Fault tolerance improves as you add more manager nodes, but Docker recommends no more than seven managers so that performance is not negatively impacted since each node must acknowledge proposals to update the state of the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should also distribute your manager nodes in separate locations so they are not affected by the same outage. If they run on the same server, a hardware problem could cause them all to go down. The high availability Swarm cluster that you will be set up in this tutorial will therefore exhibit the following characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 total nodes (2 workers and 3 managers) with each one running on a separate server.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 worker nodes (&lt;code&gt;worker-1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;worker-2&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;3 manager nodes (&lt;code&gt;manager-1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;manager-2&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;manager-3&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;playground-CTA__DockerExtensionCTAWrapper-sc-1hwzasi-0 kkBDbd&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;Container__ContainerWrapper-sc-1i64mot-0 fjHmlh&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;playground-callout&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;dots-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;card-left&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;meshery-title&quot;

Therefore, execute all the commands below (and in step 2) on all five servers. If your host offers a snapshot feature, you may be able to run the commands on a single server and use that server as a base for the other four instances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s start by installing the latest version of the Docker Engine (20.10.18 at the time of writing). Go ahead and update the package information list from all configured sources on your system:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot;

to use packages over HTTPS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot;

| sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list &amp;gt; /dev/null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, update apt once again and install the Docker Engine:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot;

service using the command below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot;

command can only be executed by the root user or any user in the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; group (auto created on installation). If you execute a &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; command without prefixing it with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; or running it through a user that belongs to the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; group, you will get a permission error that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix:///var/run/docker.sock: Get &amp;quot;http://%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fdocker.sock/v1.24/containers/json&amp;quot;: dial unix /var/run/docker.sock: connect: permission denied&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, using &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; is a security risk, so the solution to the above error is to add the relevant user to the &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; group. This can be achieved through the command below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;sudo usermod -aG docker $USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, run the following command and enter the user&amp;#x27;s password when prompted for the changes to take effect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;su - $USER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should now be able to run &lt;code&gt;docker&lt;/code&gt; commands without prefixing them with &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;. For example, when you run the command &lt;code&gt;docker ps&lt;/code&gt;, you should observe the output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before proceeding to the next step, ensure that all the commands in step 1 and step 2 have been executed on all five servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 3 — Initializing the Swarm Cluster&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, each of your five Docker instances are acting as separate hosts and not as part of a Swarm cluster. Therefore, in this step, we will initialize the Swarm cluster on the &lt;code&gt;manager-1&lt;/code&gt; server and add the hosts to the cluster accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by logging into one of the Ubuntu servers (&lt;code&gt;manager-1&lt;/code&gt;) and retrieve the private IP address of the machine using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;hostname -I | awk &amp;#x27;{print $1}&amp;#x27;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the IP address to your clipboard and replace the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;manager_1_server_ip&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; placeholder in the command below to initialize Swarm mode:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker swarm init --advertise-addr &amp;lt;manager_1_server_ip&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the command is successful, you will see output indicating that the Swarm has been initialized and that the current node is now a manager. It will also provide a command to join worker nodes to the cluster. Copy the command for later use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, SSH into each of the other four Ubuntu servers (manager-2, manager-3, worker-1, and worker-2) and run the command you copied earlier to join them to the Swarm cluster. The command should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker swarm join --token &amp;lt;token&amp;gt; &amp;lt;manager_1_server_ip&amp;gt;:&amp;lt;port&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;After running the command on each server, you should see output indicating that the node has joined the Swarm as either a manager or a worker. To verify the status of the Swarm cluster, you can run the command &lt;code&gt;docker node ls&lt;/code&gt; on the manager node:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker node ls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see a list of all the nodes in the Swarm cluster, including their IDs, hostname, status, availability, and whether they are a manager or a worker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 4 — Deploying the Application Stack&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have a functioning Docker Swarm cluster, you can deploy your application stack. In this tutorial, we will use a simple example of a web application stack consisting of a front-end service and a back-end service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by creating a new directory for your application stack on the manager node:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mkdir app-stack cd app-stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, create a file called &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;app-stack&lt;/code&gt; directory and open it in a text editor:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;nano docker-compose.yml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy and paste the following YAML code into the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;version: &amp;#x27;3.8&amp;#x27; services: frontend: image: nginx:latest ports: - 80:80 deploy: replicas: 2 restart_policy: condition: on-failure backend: image: httpd:latest ports: - 8080:80 deploy: replicas: 2 restart_policy: condition: on-failure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Docker Compose file defines two services: &lt;code&gt;frontend&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;backend&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;frontend&lt;/code&gt; service uses the &lt;code&gt;nginx:latest&lt;/code&gt; image and maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container. It is configured to have 2 replicas and to restart on failure. The &lt;code&gt;backend&lt;/code&gt; service uses the &lt;code&gt;httpd:latest&lt;/code&gt; image and maps port 8080 of the host to port 80 of the container. It is also configured to have 2 replicas and to restart on failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save and close the &lt;code&gt;docker-compose.yml&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deploy the application stack, run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml app-stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the command is successful, you should see output indicating that the services are being deployed. You can check the status of the services by running the command &lt;code&gt;docker service ls&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;docker service ls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see a list of the services in the stack, including their names, mode, replicas, and ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this tutorial, you learned how to set up a highly available Docker Swarm cluster and deploy a simple application stack. This setup provides fault tolerance and load balancing for your applications, allowing you to scale them easily as your needs grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore more Docker Swarm features, such as service updates and rolling updates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deploy your own application stack using Docker Compose.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn about Docker networking and how to create overlay networks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kubernetes NodePorts - Static and Dynamic Assignments]]></title><description><![CDATA[Avoiding Port Collisions with Kubernetes NodePorts Static and Dynamic Assignments]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes provides a Service to offer a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. While it offers a VIP to the clients for access and Kubernetes ensures traffic balancing for the accessing back-end Pods, it has a limitation of routing traffic from outside the cluster. The Kubernetes Service setting of &amp;quot;NodePort&amp;quot; was created to overcome this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting up a mapping to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, a NodePort Service redirects traffic from the outside to the inside of the cluster. When a NodePort Service is created, Kubernetes control plane allocates its corresponding ports in two ways. The first is dynamic, where Kubernetes control plane automatically assigns an unused port at the creation time. The second is static, which assigns a port within the nodeport port range configuration. It is crucial to assign a unique nodePort across the entire cluster while manually assigning nodePort, or it will result in an error if a service of type NodePort already uses that port. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there is a need to run a NodePort Service on well-known ports so that other components and users inside or outside the cluster can use them. In such cases, users need to reserve the required ports before using them. Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature gate &amp;quot;ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange&amp;quot; that allows users to use a different port allocation strategy for type NodePort Services. Enabling this feature gate will divide the port range for NodePort Services based on a formula that uses nodeport size and determines the size of the static port range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of different port ranges and their band offset values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;table-3&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Range properties&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;service-node-port-range&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000-32767&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band Offset&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;86&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30085&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30086&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;32767&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;table-3&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Range properties&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;service-node-port-range&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000-30015&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band Offset&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30015&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NodePort Services can be useful in many scenarios. For example, consider a user that needs to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients running outside the Kubernetes cluster. The agreed port is 30009, and the user needs to create a Service as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;apiVersion: v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kind: Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;metadata:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  name: minio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;spec:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  ports:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  - name: api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    nodePort: 30009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    port: 9000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    protocol: TCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    targetPort: 9000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  selector:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    app: minio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  type: NodePort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the port required for the Minio Service is not reserved and another NodePort (or possibly LoadBalancer) Service is created and dynamically allocated before or concurrently with the Minio Service, the TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that other Service. In this case, creation of the Minio Service will fail due to a node port collision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, using the NodePort Service will help Kubernetes users by allowing traffic to be routed from outside to inside the cluster, providing a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. By enabling the ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange feature gate, users can adopt a different port allocation strategy, reducing the risk of collisions while using a different range of ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
