This includes installation and deletion, configuration, and verification that an installation follows recommended practices. In addition, Meshery adapters can assess to what extent a service mesh complies to the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/announcements/a-standard-interface-for-service-meshes&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface standard&lt;/a&gt;. Meshery adapters support management of multiple versions of their respective service mesh and also come bundled with sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of service mesh capabilities. &lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Meshery adapters manage the lifecycle of service meshes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes the &lt;code&gt;MeshServiceServer&lt;/code&gt;

It does not, as the name might imply, create an instance of a service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;MeshName&lt;/code&gt; returns the name of the mesh, configured in the adapter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;SupportedOperations&lt;/code&gt; returns all supported operations, configured in the adapter. An operation is e.g. the installation of a service mesh.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ApplyOperation&lt;/code&gt; executes the operation specified in the request. It is one of the supported operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;StreamEvents&lt;/code&gt; allows sending events from the server to the client.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This API is one of the extension points of Meshery, making it easy to add support for new service meshes to Meshery. Meshery adapters abstract away differences in installation and configuration of the various service meshes.&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different service meshes, exposing their differentiated value to users.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the various service mesh implementations are installed and configured in their own way. For instance, some service meshes have their own installer, like &lt;code&gt;istioctl&lt;/code&gt; for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. One of the purposes of Meshery adapters is to abstract these differences away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Meshery Adapter Library&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. Initially, this common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several libraries. After some discussion, the community decided to move some of the more general code to Meshkit, and adapter specific code to a new library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the Meshery Adapter Library was born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the adapters substantially, making adapter code easier to follow. This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time. For the same reasons, it is important such libraries are easily understandable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, it means new adapters can be implemented quickly, as only configuration and operations that differ between services meshes need to be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fact&quot;&gt;The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality that Meshery adapters use for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial commit was submitted on October 6th, 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/tag/kuma&quot;&gt;Kuma service mesh&lt;/a&gt;. Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on the Meshery Adapter Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the Meshery Adapter Library is to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core interface in the library is the adapter &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;/code&gt; interface:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 ktJhqS&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 gooVkb&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 ktJhqS prism-code language-go&quot;

style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It corresponds closely to the gRPC API discussed above, and indeed these methods are called in the implementation of the &lt;code&gt;MeshServiceServer&lt;/code&gt; interface. This implementation is also part of the Meshery Adapter Library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; embedding, an adapter extends the default implementation &lt;code&gt;Adapter&lt;/code&gt; of the interface &lt;code&gt;Handler&lt;/code&gt; from the library.
Usually, it is sufficient that this adapter handler overrides only the &lt;code&gt;ApplyOperation&lt;/code&gt; function from the default implementation.
(There, it is a no-op implementation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure below illustrates this and the usage of the library in an adapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-adapter-library-87cadec58c99e3bd648a1bdc74cfe10e.svg&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; alt=&quot;meshery adapter library&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; package of the adapter, the default configuration provider &lt;code&gt;Viper&lt;/code&gt; from the library is instantiated, and reads the adapter specific configuration. This includes a specification of all available operations. As configuration providers are implementations of an interface, you can choose any of the providers from the library, or implement your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, an instance of the adapter handler is created. Other components, for instance a logger, may be created depending on needs and requirements, which is symbolize by the three dots in the figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;service&lt;/code&gt; is a struct that holds all the parameters that specify an adapter service, like the port the gRPC server is running on, and the instance of the adapter handler created in a previous step. This struct is passed to the &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; function from the library. This &lt;code&gt;Start&lt;/code&gt; function wraps the gRPC server, wiring up all necessary components, and starts the service. The developer does not need to touch any gRPC code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extracting common code from adapters to the two new libraries has proven to be a worthwhile investment. It led to cleaner code as well as cleaner application architecture, shortened implementation time for new adapters considerably, and upleveled the quality of Meshery&amp;#x27;s adapters through consistency of implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.S.

Michael is an avid research enthusiast in addition to holding the title of Chief Engineer at his day job. With exhaustive interests ranging from software architecture to systems security, he has been working with cloud architecture for the past four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the affects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Michael is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made you stay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Shriti, thank you for having me. If I remember correctly, I was looking for a professional focus area earlier this year, and landed on service meshes. I had worked with service meshes before, which piqued my initial interest. I had worked with Istio as part of my work for some time, and in the same context I stumbled across Meshery. I wasn’t able to dig deep in Meshery back then, but the concept sounded fascinating to me. Additionally, I had been benefiting from open source, both personally and professionally for a long time, but apart from a few minor contributions, I had never been able to give back to the community. I hoped to correct that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I re-discovered Meshery and the Layer5 community, listened to a recording of a community meeting, and read a couple of blog posts describing the community and member experience posts. One that stood out for me was a post by &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/nikhil-ladha&quot;&gt;MeshMate Nikhil Ladha&lt;/a&gt;. Going by his words, it appeared to be a warm, diverse and active community. My suspicions were confirmed when I joined. Layer5 offers a wholesome, interactive community in addition to unbiasedly providing help and guidance around the virtual corner.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/projects&quot;&gt;Layer5 projects&lt;/a&gt; has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on?&lt;i&gt;Psst.&lt;/i&gt; Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I’m a technical architect and programmer, which made the backend, especially the adapters, a natural choice for me. It involves both contributing to the management plane, but also looking at and using service meshes from an architectural point of view. The possible implementations of service meshes is an area that has been particularly fascinating for me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I’d probably continue to work with the Meshery adapters for now before moving on to other areas of the project. Haha, I would probably name the Meshery Adapter Library as my favorite Layer5 project till date.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have worked and collaborated with several open source communities before, including Eclipse Modelling Framework and Apache ServiceMix . I couldn’t possibly make a very accurate comparison, given by limited interaction with other communities, but the Layer5 community stands out based on the unique and extremely inclusive approach it takes towards upholding community values.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is so fascinating about service meshes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;data:image/svg+xml;base64,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&quot;/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I find meshes intriguing in general. Meshes can look intricate, layered and complicated at a first glance, and yet they are built on the most basic principles. For me, meshes are visual structures, complete with an aesthetic and artistic dimension. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fun Fact: Overlapping meshes resulting in Moiré patterns are an example of this. They appealed to me from a young age, and I learned about their mathematics from my mathematics teacher.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;An increasing number of applications nowadays consist of distributed services, both in the  cloud and on-premises, in mixed and hybrid environments.  Many legacy applications are in express need of modernisation, consuming and being consumed by cloud native applications.  Introducing microservices, also by refactoring monolithic applications, increases the complexity of the service landscape. By delegating cross-cutting infrastructure concerns like security, traffic management, resilience, and observability to the services mesh, some of the complexity is moved from the applications to the service mesh, allowing application developers to focus on business logic. A concern in these distributed, dynamic and scalable systems is that the security also needs to scale. If security doesn’t scale, it becomes very challenging to handle such systems. Services meshes today are already able to support many of these scenarios, and are continuously improving.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Service meshes are complex but that is something I enjoy attempting as a challenge, to have control and overview and make it appear simple, investing into automating options. Another field that I’m excited to learn about continuously is related to  the security of distributed systems, and how service meshes contribute to implementing a  zero trust network architecture.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/michaelgfeller/status/1289951164281233408&quot; target=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;dreamed about service mesh&lt;/a&gt; a while ago. That was almost a bit spooky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;right&quot;

What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;At the moment, Meshery provides a management plane solution and provides support for the SMI and &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; (SMP) specifications. Helpful additions in the future should be the configuration based best practices, especially with regards to security and to possibly extend to owning up specific routes on security. For instance by verifying that the recommendations outlined in the NIST report “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture” by Ramaswamy Chandramouli and Zack Butcher.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are today&amp;#x27;s challenges when working with service meshes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can’t claim to have worked with many implementations, and to have a good overview and wide experience. A lot of the complexity is already handled, but there is still enough to decide and implement for each solution. The solution makes for a challenging but highly interesting task. Additionally, there are a variety of different solutions from different vendors, which is excellent but it also makes it hard to know which would be the best fit for a given situation. Here, again, Meshery can be of invaluable help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The service mesh promise holds a lot of potential, for instance for modernization and ease of use. A lot appears to be happening these times. It will be interesting to see how serverless solutions will be integrated. Enabling a seamless implementation experience for solutions embracing multi-cloud, on-prem and legacy systems is also something to look forward to. Additionally, service meshes are aimed at making your architecture more secure and stable, which makes security a big concern for any service mesh provider. Improvements along these points will be topics I’ll be watching out for over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up. Cloud Native and especially, the field of service meshes evolving exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh implementations consist of many components, and I try to stay up to date in general.  Try to follow as much as possible conferences and vendor announcements, blog posts etc. mainly by following related Twitter accounts. Also, trying to find some time to explore various solutions. Lee’s books are of course an excellent source. Another book I can recommend is Zero Trust Networks book by Gilman and Barth. It really helped me to understand how service meshes relate to zero trust network architecture and can help to move towards it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I take my role as a Meshery maintainer with its benefits and responsibilities. For one, it means to be able to give back to the community. I meet a lot of interesting and friendly people from around the globe, learning about their culture at the same time. Additionally, Open Source allows me to work on and dive into tasks as I like, making it easy to integrate the work with my existing work schedule. It also allows me to learn a lot, expanding on my understanding of service meshes, keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and also giving me the opportunity to witness first-hand how others are using them. This has a quite direct impact on my full-time role, complementing the work I do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shriti:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michael:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A general love for software development combined with a readiness to help out newcomers and participating in the growing community is the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come and visit, there is something for everyone, be it frontend, backend, CI/CD, website, documentation, standards, interfacing with other communities, and more. The friendly community members and the meshmates will provide support and guidance. Browse the Layer5 and Meshery websites and the repositories on GitHub, where issues suitable for newcomers are especially tagged.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/forklift-02625ac7f87b8eaa49dfc1300790002b.svg&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his relatively short tenure at Layer5, Michael has already delivered a wave of meshy contributions enhancing the Meshery adapters and improving upon Meshery’s architecture. With a penchant for looking behind the curtain and tightening loose cogs until they run to perfection, Michael&amp;#x27;s impactful and consistent contributions have him taking his place as Meshery maintainer. The Meshery project moves an impressive pace thanks to maintainers like Michael.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;centered-text&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Be like Mike&amp;quot;.

MeshMates aid in identifying areas of projects to engage within, working groups to join, and in helping community members grow in their open source and cloud native knowledge. By connecting one-on-one, MeshMates will share tips on how to have the best community experience possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/tanuj-agarwal&quot;&gt;Tanuj Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshmate-tanuj-agarwal-49fbd983be2d08e7127e5f44bf5cf6ed.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;tanuj-agarwal&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was introduced to the Layer5 community three months back. Being fairly new to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted! It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/kelechi-nwachukwu&quot;&gt;Kelechi Precious Nwachukwu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshmate-kelechi-precious-a5f2c77ca23dae296e4230523fddabc6.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;kelechi-precious&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn&amp;#x27;t something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous tech domains , I didn&amp;#x27;t even understand some of the jargon, and was too ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;invert&quot; href=&quot;/community/members/ruth-ikegah&quot;&gt; Ruth Ikegah &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshmate-ruth-ikegah-b1376e0b2e55e8fbfc30c2f327f4ebb2.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;ruth-ikegah&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself. Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only 6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel, after which I visited the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail.

Open Service Mesh is a contemporary addition to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/landscape&quot;&gt;service mesh landscape&lt;/a&gt;. Using Envoy as its data plane proxy component and SMI specifications as it&amp;#x27;s control plane APIs, OSM draws lessons and code from existing service mesh projects, like Linkerd. The Open Service Mesh project has some miles to go as it is one of a growing list of choices available in the service mesh landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First pronounced to be SMI compliant by &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;, the service mesh management plane, the first release of OSM supports a myriad of basic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Securing service to service links&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supporting traffic shifting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Managing observability for your services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Validating and Implementing access control policies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Auto addition of applications and services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started with OSM using Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Layer5&amp;#x27;s effort to support our multi-mesh world, our Meshery project provides an effortless way for Kubernetes operators to install, maintain and run service meshes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases/tag/v0.4.3&quot;&gt;Meshery v0.4.3&lt;/a&gt; includes the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-osm&quot;&gt;Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt;, enabling you to quickly provision OSM, run any number of sample applications, manage its performance using &lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io/&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; (SMP), validate OSM&amp;#x27;s compliance to SMI using a suite of conformance tests.

New releases for Meshery are published on a frequent cadence with new features and bug fixes. Today, we are announcing version 0.4.0 of Meshery. This summary highlights Meshery&amp;#x27;s latest developments and elucidates new features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#x27;s New?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The v0.4.0 release of Meshery introduces a plethora of new features and bug fixes across service mesh environments spanning Meshery and it&amp;#x27;s various adapters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery&amp;#x27;s CLI: &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Command Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt; commands and subcommands have been restructured in v0.4.0 into the categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Global Commands and Flags&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery Lifecycle Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Service Mesh Lifecycle Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workload Lifecycle Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizing commnands &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl&quot;&gt;under these categories&lt;/a&gt; is done with both the intention to make &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt; functions intuitively at your fingertips, but also to make room for forthcoming functionality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposing Performance Management in the CLI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;code&gt;perf:&lt;/code&gt; a new &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt;command. Introduction of new performance sub-commands, now benchmark your service mesh at the tip of your fingers using our new CLI command &lt;code&gt;perf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for Scoop&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
Support extended to Scoop Bucket. You can now install mesheryctl on your Windows machine with Scoop Bucket. Visit the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/scoop-bucket&quot;&gt;Meshery Scoop Bucket&lt;/a&gt; to install Meshery on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rename &lt;code&gt;cleanup&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;reset&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;cleanup&lt;/code&gt; is used to reset your Meshery deployment configuration back to its default settings. This command has been renamed to &lt;code&gt;reset&lt;/code&gt; to more appropriately reflect its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;MeshSync&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-operator-dark-582dfb152b2f1df450cc90d895a81b5e.svg&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;meshery-operator-dark&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A component of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator&quot;&gt;Meshery Operator&lt;/a&gt;, MeshSync can scan the environment to get the deployment details of specific types of service meshes and the connected Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshSync is a new component addition to Meshery. Meshery needs to be constantly updated given that service meshes and their underlying infrastructure are dynamic, constantly changing.  Meshery operations should be resilient in the face of this change.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;MeshSync brings a service mesh agnostic object model that defines relationships between all objects under management.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh (beta)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/meshery-architecture-5f354d542fc7574dfa7af90642ce93ad.png&quot; class=&quot;image-right&quot; alt=&quot;meshery-architecture&quot;/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx&quot;&gt;Citrix Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt; is now a supported service mesh. Meshery incorporates support for the Citrix ADC CPX, which is a cloud-ready, container-based application delivery controller that can be provisioned on a Docker host.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CPX runs as the Istio Data Plane component, displacing Envoy as the default data plane service proxy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security &amp;amp; Authentication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery has moved from using session authentication to JWT authentication. Meshery&amp;#x27;s JWT authentication is powered by Hydra Auth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can now opt to authenticate yourself on mesheryctl while performing performance tests using &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl&lt;/code&gt;, you can authenticate yourself by getting the JWT Token from Meshery UI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery Server&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support provided for &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#load-generators&quot;&gt;wrk2 as an alternative load generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility&quot;&gt;Providers&lt;/a&gt; - A new project construct that allows users to select authentication, long-term storage etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ad-hoc &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#grafana-and-meshery&quot;&gt;connectivity tests for Prometheus and Grafana&lt;/a&gt; are now supported.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extraneous information beyond IP address and port in Grafana and Prometheus endpoints have been stripped off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Meshery UI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;ES-Lint has been added to the client side to ensure the quality of code and increase maintainaiblity of code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cypress has been set-up to enable end-to-end tests and integration tests for Meshery UI.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe frameBorder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9D2KgZKxo&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other notable changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;From within the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9D2KgZKxo&amp;amp;list=PL3A-A6hPO2IM7rYiKxG4l3eQNc6X3IUex&quot;&gt;Meshery Continuous Integration Working Group&lt;/a&gt;, we have strengthened our continuous integration (CI) actions &amp;amp; tests by introducing new workflows like &lt;code&gt;static check&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;vet check&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;security check&lt;/code&gt; for our server code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ReleaseDrafter &amp;amp; WelcomeBot has been added to the repository to enable automation of release notes and for welcoming new contributors, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.4.0 release, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/releases&quot;&gt;Meshery Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say &amp;quot;Hi&amp;quot; on our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Slack Channel&lt;/a&gt; and one of us will reach out to you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How I schooled my seniors]]></title><description><![CDATA[function _extends() { _extends = Object.assign || function (target) { for (var i = 1; i < arguments.length; i++) { var source = arguments[i]; for (var key in source) { if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) { target[key] = source[key]; } } } return target; }; return _extends.apply(this, arguments); }

class=&quot;image-left&quot; alt=&quot;Layer5 and Istio&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I started learning on Service Mesh and it was a very interesting journey as I explored the Service Mesh
landscape starting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/istio-service-mesh-workshop&quot;&gt;Layer5 tutorials&lt;/a&gt; and by exploring
the blogs at &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/&quot;&gt;Istio.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our organization decided to use the features of Istio for securing, managing and automating microservices. However, we have to support a multi-tenant environment and that became a challenge due to lack of sufficient documentation and clarity. To give a little bit of background on the problem, we have a single cluster with multiple tenants in different namespaces sharing the same cluster . We do not want to provide each tenant their own separate Kubernetes Cluster because that would be additional provisioning overhead, management overhead and also additional resource overhead on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, I will go over the concepts and visual representation as well as the steps to learn and build your setup.
Now there are different combinations possible depending on the requirements. These could be :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Single Istio Control Plane with its own Ingress-Gateway to ensure traffic for the control plane is coming via the same control plane Ingress-Gateway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One or more Workspace namespaces for the workload applications and each with its own instance of the ingress gateway&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More advanced scenario would be multiple Control Plane and its associated Data Plane or essentially Multiple Service Mesh within a single Kubernetes Cluster. This is presently feasible using the Maistra Istio Operator, but its not fully supported using the upstream Istio at present. I intend to go over this use case in a later article.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here by Ingress Gateway we mean the Istio Ingress Gateway and not the Kubernetes Ingress Gateway.
Now, before we get into the steps for building an Istio Multi-tenant setup, lets quickly review the prerequisite :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes setup (in the steps below I am using v1.18 on ubuntu 18.04)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 ktJhqS&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 gooVkb&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 ktJhqS prism-code language-sh&quot;

but before that a few word on the Istio operator would be nice. The Istio Operator follows the Kubernetes Controller and Custom Resource Definition mechanism and basically the above steps create an Istio operator controller in the istio-operator namespace and also registers the CRDs in the Kubernetes Registry. Basically, it extends the API for Kubernetes and allows management of a Custom Resource(CR). A word of caution, the existing upstream Istio Operator does not follow any Operator Framework like kubebuilder or Operator SDK. Hence, many of the expected behavior fail like trying to create two Istio Operator Custom Resource(the community mentions it as &lt;code&gt;iop&lt;/code&gt; instances) in different namespaces or multiple &lt;code&gt;iop&lt;/code&gt; instances and are under heavy development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok, so now lets jump into action. We will build our Istio Setup for the scenario 1 &amp;amp;2 above shown in the diagram below. There are three different instances of Ingress Gateway(and it could be egress gateway as well) :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;a. Ingress Gateway in Control Plane for traffic entry point to the Control plane Observability Components like &lt;code&gt;Kiali&lt;/code&gt;(for the Service Mesh Graph), &lt;code&gt;Prometheus&lt;/code&gt;(for metrics),Grafana(for visual charts of the metrics)and &lt;code&gt;Jaeger&lt;/code&gt; (for distributed tracing between the services)
b. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 1 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 1 microservices.
c. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 2 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 2 microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image1-bd8836be71e2f6e83d80b6b573f5f48f.png&quot; alt=&quot;kubernetes-cluster&quot;/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Single Control Plane with Multiple Data Plane each with separate Ingress Gateway&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creation of Control Plane CR and Data Plane CR
A sample CR for creation of the Control plane and Data Plane CR can be referred below :&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 ktJhqS&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 gooVkb&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 ktJhqS prism-code language-sh&quot;

It is important to ensure the label maps the label on the ingress-gateway.
Once this is done the traffic will start flowing the intended gateway and it could be observed on the Kiali dashboard.
Please note that in this scenario the Kiali is also accessed via the default control plane ingress-gateway running in the istio-system control plane namespace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image3-d3e81d811eb5c2fc0b6ed775119004a4.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Kiali view for Workspace-1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/image4-8143323bbcc5c75ba6067f32d332d591.png&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot;/&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Kiali view for Workspace-2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly, we will go over the 3rd scenario which is to run multiple Istio Control Planes (Multiple Service Meshes) within the same Kubernetes Cluster. For that, we will need to build an open-shift setup and deploy the Maistra Istio Operator.

From there, it was a swift journey to the Layer5 Slack Channel where I truly understood what Subham had meant about the warm welcome. I was amazed by how helpful and willing the entire community was. Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC)."), mdx("img", {

I did some research on service meshes and made my way to the Layer5 Github repo. From there, it was a swift journey to the Layer5 Slack Channel where I truly understood what Subham had meant about the warm welcome. I was amazed by how helpful and willing the entire community was. Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/pic4-0176c8952a22a968907f730985b44dc8.png&quot; alt=&quot;github-profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is Meshery?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery is a multi-service mesh management plane that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and applications running on top of those meshes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;static/pic1-7b97022179988c7336c13776f966e435.png&quot; alt=&quot;meshry&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery uses a common service mesh performance specification to describe and capture performance benchmarks and results.

My initial interest in Layer5 was sparked when, for a project in my Masters course, I was required to build a microservice architecture and develop a service layer on top of it.
A basic Google search led me to a plethora of resources, which in turn led me to understand how different service meshes could be compared. Comparison and selection of a service mesh was my first step to deploying one on my VM cluster. Amidst the varied resources available to me, stumbling onto Layer5 and Meshery was a happy boon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Meshery?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, Meshery proved to be an intuitive and easy-to-use application. Among other benefits, it could be implemented into my project with ease which was also a major contributing factor behind my choice of taking advantage of its features for my project thesis.

This became apparent by how robust Meshery’s adapter for Istio is, which includes the ability to analyze and validate my deployment’s configuration against best practices. Each adapter includes a set of sample applications that makes it convenient to explore the functionality of different meshes, using the same application across them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior that was of keen interest to me, however, was that of my custom, microservices.

specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec&quot;&gt;SMI Github Repository&lt;/a&gt;. Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;APIs in SMI&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs&quot;&gt;Traffic Specs&lt;/a&gt; - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control&quot;&gt;Traffic Access Control&lt;/a&gt; - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split&quot;&gt;Traffic Split&lt;/a&gt; - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics&quot;&gt;Traffic Metrics&lt;/a&gt; - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About SMI Conformance Tests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SMI Conformance Tests&lt;/strong&gt; check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds fun, right?

align=&quot;left&quot; alt=&quot;checklist&quot; width=&quot;250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/service-mesh-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt;  is _the service mesh management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.&lt;p&gt;As you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Bigger Picture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Forking &lt;a href=&quot;https://kuttl.dev/&quot;&gt;kuttl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt; is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It&amp;#x27;s entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked &lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt; and modified it a little. You can see our modified version &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are planning to use &lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt; for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of &lt;code&gt;kuttl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/&quot;&gt;Learn Layer5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and &lt;code&gt;smi-conformance&lt;/code&gt; testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.
Head over to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://slack.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Slack Channel&lt;/a&gt; and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
