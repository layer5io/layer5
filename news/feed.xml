It also provides access to a catalog of hundreds of pre-built, best-practice design patterns and reference architectures that IT teams can extend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Kanvas also makes available role-based access controls (RBAC) and an ability to import existing Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize configuration and Docker Compose files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available to be deployed by an internal IT team or access as a managed service, Kanvas today provides a drag-and-drop interface for designing and visualizing complex infrastructure and application architectures using Meshery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 is also making available in beta a Kanvas Operator for managing live infrastructure in real-time using a Meshery framework that is currently being advanced under the auspices of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 CEO Lee Calcote said at its core Meshery provides a platform that fosters collaboration in a way that makes it simpler for IT teams to retain tribal knowledge. It allows engineers to see, collaborate on, and approve suggestions on a visual canvas, and even conduct a dry run to validate changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to making it simpler to manage Kubernetes clusters at scale, Kanvas also makes it simpler to onboard additional engineers to a team, noted Calcote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not clear how many Kubernetes clusters are deployed in production environments, but as the number increases, the need for finding ways to manage one of the most complex IT platforms ever created is becoming more acute. There simply are not enough engineers to manage those clusters, so platforms such as Kanvas that make it simpler for small teams to consistently manage the configuration of Kubernetes clusters is crucial, said Calcote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, as various tools make Kubernetes more accessible, organizations will be able to rely more on IT administrators rather than DevOps engineers to manage them. The need for DevOps engineers isn’t likely to be eliminated any time soon, but it should become easier for IT teams to reuse configurations that have already been validated by a DevOps team. In effect, Meshery and Kanvas are making it simpler for IT teams to embrace infrastructure by design principles, noted Calcote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, IT organizations should expect the total number of workloads running on Kubernetes clusters to continue to steadily increase, especially as more artificial intelligence (AI) applications are built and deployed. The challenge, as always, is finding a way to manage large numbers of Kubernetes clusters at higher levels of scale. In fact, arguably there would many more Kubernetes clusters already deployed in the platform if the platform was easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, there will come a day soon when the inherent complexity of Kubernetes is no longer an issue, but until then, the next best thing is to adopt tools that enable IT teams to manage clusters at a much higher level of abstraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudnativenow.com/features/layer5-debuts-enterprise-edition-of-meshery-for-configuring-kubernetes/&quot;&gt;https://cloudnativenow.com/features/layer5-debuts-enterprise-edition-of-meshery-for-configuring-kubernetes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layer5 Unveils Kanvas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Empowering Platform and Operations Teams with Intuitive Tools to Design, Deploy, and Operate Kubernetes and Multi-Cloud Infrastructure]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/company/news/layer5-unveils-kanvas</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/company/news/layer5-unveils-kanvas</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[The Newsroom]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 11 Nov 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/72106b16d634bf9bfc689071f4aba4ce/Layer5-Kanvas-Designer.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Newsstyle__NewsWrapper-sc-12r6uiw-0 bzJNOf&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATLANTA, GA&lt;/strong&gt; - November 11th, 2025 – &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt;, the company behind the popular &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; project, today announced the general availability (GA) of Kanvas.

Kubernetes has multiple updates this year, the new release follows the Kubernetes 1.28 update that came out in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the “Mandala” release after the cosmic circular artwork, Kubernetes v1.29 reflects the project’s interconnected community of contributors. The release was shepherded by a 40-person release team and saw participation from 888 companies and 1,422 individuals over 14 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the major additions in this version are 11 features promoted to stable release status for general availability. This includes the new ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode that ensures only one pod can read/write a volume, node volume expansion secret support for container storage interface (CSI)  drivers and encryption at rest using KMS v2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen features have entered beta, highlighting improvements to scheduling, node lifecycle management  and cleaning up legacy service account tokens. Some of the new alpha functionality includes better pod affinity rules, an nftables backend for kube-proxy networking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking improvements in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.29 multiple networking improvements. The new Kubernetes release will be the first to benefit from the new gateway API that helps to improve overall connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidecar containers also get a major boost. &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote/bio&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;/company/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and a CNCF contributor told  SDxCentral that Kubernetes 1.28 introduced the concept of a sidecar container – a restartable init container. The concept of a sidecar has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. He noted that sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies in service meshes or for logging or running other auxiliary services to the main container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until 1.28, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support, and beginning now in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers, the kubelet (Kubernete node agent) will delay sending a termination signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated,” Calcote said. “Also new in 1.29 is the behavior of sidecar containers being terminated in reverse of the order in which they were initialized, so that they may continue to offer their services up to the very end of the Pod’s lifecycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[ Kubernetes 1.28 improves open-source cloud-native compute and networking]]></title><description><![CDATA[Explore Kubernetes 1.28: the latest update enhancing cloud-native computing.

Among the updates in Kubernetes 1.28 are enhancements designed to help with resiliency, including the ability to recover from non-graceful node shutdowns. There are also a series of networking-related enhancements that will enable better security and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the case with every Kubernetes release, there is a theme and a code name; for Kubernetes 1.28 the name is “Planternetes.” “So in the northern hemisphere, it’s summer right now and I think the symbolism of the garden and our community goes hand in hand,” Grace Nguyen, release lead for Kubernetes 1.28, told SDxCentral. “Each of us has a very important role in the ecosystem and together we built this big, open-source project that has a lot of impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking enhancements in Kubernetes 1.28&lt;/h3&gt;Looking specifically at the networking capabilities of Kubernetes 1.28, there are a few enhancements that will also help to improve overall performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote/bio&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and a CNCF contributor, explained that one of the key networking updates is an enhancement to the kube-proxy feature that will enable better connection-draining capabilities for load balancers targeting terminating nodes.&lt;p&gt;“This enhancement improves the reliability of load balancer health checks and connection draining for terminating nodes within Kubernetes, so that kube-proxy can independently report its health regardless of the terminating state of the node,” Calcote told SDxCentral. “In this way, cloud providers in particular can be more sophisticated in ascertaining if a load balancer should target a specific node for ingress traffic or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also of note in Kubernetes 1.28 for networking is IPv4 to IPv6 dual-stack transition support for Kubernetes pods. Calcote explained that this enhancement allows pods to access information about both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the node they are running on, thereby enhancing their ability to adapt to dual-stack network transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native networking beyond Kubernetes
While Kubernetes has many built-in capabilities, extensibility of the platform is a key attribute as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcote explained that proxies running in Kubernetes are quite powerful and many support on-the-fly insertion or removal of traffic filters as plugins, with technologies like Envoy, Traefik, and NGINX as prime examples. He noted that each technology varies in support for the chaining of multiple filters and for the programming languages in which developers can create these filters. Envoy, in particular, supports WebAssembly (WASM)-based filters, which means that a number of different languages are supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kubernetes has yet to address this deeper area of network traffic management, which is where CNCF projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; step in with WASM filter management for any Envoy proxy or Envoy-based service-mesh data plane,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.28 has deep roots for stability
Nguyen noted that there are some 45 enhancements in the Kubernetes 1.28 update, spanning new stable, beta and alpha capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is widely deployed on public cloud providers and is also used as the foundation of several commercial offerings, including one from IBM‘s Red Hat business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The latest release of Kubernetes has a number of enhancements to help increase the stability, performance and maintainability of the core platform while also augmenting workload innovation, including AI [artificial intelligence] and virtual machines,” Karena Angell, OpenShift Commons lead and senior principal product manager for Red Hat OpenShift and Hybrid Platforms, told SDxCentral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angell said Red Hat is particularly interested in the new node system memory swap support that has been added to Kubernetes 1.28 to enable better memory performance across a cluster. Additionally, she noted that the Kubernetes Job API now allows for more choices in AI model training and retraining, which is especially key for AI-driven and intelligent workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Kubernetes continues to mature as a platform with release 1.28, we’re very happy to see a number of new features and tweaks that further support production stability and consistency,” Angell said. “Large and complicated jobs can now fail faster and more accurately which, while it sounds strange, contributes to better overall performance of Kubernetes in production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Most Innovative Cloud Management Companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Layer5 stands out as one of the most innovative cloud management companies among 100,000 Texas-based startups, acknowledged for its exceptional performance in company track record, executive leadership, market share, innovation, and ESG rating.]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/company/news/the-most-innovative-cloud-management-companies</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/company/news/the-most-innovative-cloud-management-companies</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Best Startup Texas]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 15:58:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/bc8c3bab97b6d1c1577838cfae767899/best-startup-texas.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Newsstyle__NewsWrapper-sc-12r6uiw-0 bzJNOf&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 is featured as one of the most innovative cloud management companies by Best Startup Texas.

And they’re all in one place—look no further than the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).This Linux Foundation body has become a locus of some stellar cloud-native open source projects. The CNCF now hosts an array of helpful packages, spanning container scheduling, observability, persistent storage, container runtime and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odds are the cloud-native DevOps tool you need has already been developed—it’s only a matter of finding it. In recent posts, we highlighted many CNCF tools across various areas. Below, we’ll gloss over each category from a birds-eye view. Click each headline for the full rundown, or read below for a summary of the tools in each category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scheduling  Orchestration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kubernetes is the most popular container scheduling tool. It can be used to automate the deployment and management of multi-cloud applications. Other scheduling and orchestration utilities from CNCF include Crossplane, Fluid, Karmada, kube-rs, Open Cluster Management and Volcano.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Observability and Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prometheus tops the list of observability and analysis tools. The platform can be used to power your monitoring and alerting systems with fine-grained metrics and excellent querying capabilities. Other CNCF tools for observability and analysis include Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Cortex and OpenTelemetry.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security and Compliance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Policy Agent (OPA) can be used to unify cloud-native policies across the cloud-native stack. OPA uses a common language to express authorization policies and provides a policy engine to make authorization decisions. Other CNCF projects that deliver security-as-code include The Update Framework (TUF), Falco, Notary, cert-manager and Curiefense.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CI/CD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argo is a suite of packages that help direct jobs on Kubernetes to aid a continuous delivery pipeline. Using Argo, developers can create multi-step custom workflows and share these workflows across a cluster. Other CI/CD tools hosted by CNCF include Flux, Brigade, Keptn, OpenGitOps and OpenKruise.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linkerd is a highly performant developer-favorite service mesh comprised of a control plane to apply configurations and a data plane that deploys its own unique proxy. This proxy can apply consistent security, observability, monitoring and telemetry features across distributed microservices. Other service mesh tools from CNCF include Kuma, Open Service Mesh (OSM), &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface (SMI) &lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/cloud-native-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance(SMP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Proxies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Envoy is a service proxy commonly used within service meshes like Istio and Kuma. Envoy is intended to run alongside applications to help standardize networking and observability within large microservices networks. Other service proxy projects include Contour BFE and OpenELB.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rook is a tool that helps automate away some of the pains of managing cloud-native persistent storage. Rook supports file, block and object storage types and can be used for programmatic storage, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring and resource management. Other cloud-native persistent storage projects include Longhorn, CubeFS, K8up, OpenEBS, ORAS, Piraeus Datastore and Vineyard.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud-Native Database Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TiKV is a unified distributed storage layer that can process large amounts of data. The project supports a key-value API and has rapid response times. Other cloud-native database utilities include Vitess, a clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL and SchemaHero, a Kubernetes operator for declarative database schema management.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Container Runtime&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime supported by most container-based systems. Originally built as part of Docker, containerd was donated to the Linux Foundation in 2015. Other notable CNCF container runtime utilities include CRI-O, Inclavare Containers and WasmEdge Runtime.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;App Definition and Build Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helm is a prevalent Kubernetes package manager widely used to share a manifest of dependencies. Operators often use Helm charts to find and install third-party applications. Other notable tools which help address operational concerns of Kubernetes include Buildpacks, KubeVirt, Operator Framework and Backstage.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud-Native Networking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cilium is a tool that brings eBPF-based networking, security and observability. Cilium helps build out networking between container workloads and cross-cluster connectivity. Additional cloud-native networking utilities include Antrea, CNI-Genie, Kube-OVN, Network Service Mesh (NSM) and Submariner. There’s also the Container Network Interface (CNI), an interface specification for container networking.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Streaming and Messaging&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CloudEvents offers a specification intended to help standardize the event-based communication from various event publisher systems. By having a way to describe events consistently, developers could solve interoperability issues. Other CNCF streaming and messaging projects include NATS, Pravega, Strimzi and Tremor.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Chaos Engineering&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chaos Mesh is a chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes. Using Chaos Mesh, operators can push their Kubernetes deployments to the limit with stress testing, fault injections, and other testing behaviors. You can also schedule routine tests. Other cloud-native chaos testing tools from CNCF include Litmus and ChaosBlade.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Management&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SPIFFE is defined as a universal identity control plane for a distributed architecture. Using SPIFFE, engineers can quickly construct a standard method to identify workloads and automatically secure service-to-service communication. SPIRE is the product-ready reference implementation of SPIFFE. Other key management tools from CNCF include Athenz and Teller.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Edge Computing and Bare Metal&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;KubeEdge helps extend cloud-native capabilities into edge computing. It’s specifically designed with the constraints of edge nodes in mind, such as reliability and resource limitations. Other projects that help extend Kubernetes to the edge include Akri, OpenYurt and SuperEdge. Other tools aid in provisioning K8s on bare metal, such as Metal3.io and Tinkerbell.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Forecast Looks Cloud-Native&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By 2023, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://containerjournal.com/features/majority-of-apps-will-use-cloud-native-development-by-2023/&quot;&gt;majority of applications will be cloud-native&lt;/a&gt;. The cloud-native world is here to stay, and open source is the foundation to support our new era of microservices, containerization and DevOps.&lt;p&gt;Although you could technically self-host your way through development and operations using these open source projects, organizations will most likely adopt a blend of open source, proprietary and as-a-service cloud offerings to get the job done. Regardless, it’s cool to know what’s available for free use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also be mentioned that tools change from time to time. As such, you can always view the up-to-date CNCF landscape here. Stay tuned as we keep an eye on CNCF and related bodies that continue to carry the cloud-native torch forward!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel, Layer5 Announce MeshMark to Quantify Cloud-Native Performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[MeshMark, a metric introduced by Intel and Layer5, helps quantify and optimize cloud-native service mesh deployments.

In cloud-native environments, the use of service mesh technologies to connect different operations is a growing trend. What isn&amp;#x27;t always clear with a service mesh though is how well it&amp;#x27;s actually working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshMark, an open source effort jointly announced by Intel and service mesh startup Layer5 on May 18, looks to help organizations measure and quantify the performance and value of a service mesh deployment.

The project also aims to provide the details in a consistent approach that can enable organizations to develop a baseline for an environment, as well as benchmark in a consistent way. Simply being aware of what&amp;#x27;s running in a service mesh isn&amp;#x27;t quite enough though, and there is a need for a performance metric, which is where the new MeshMark effort comes into play. Mrittika Ganguli, principal engineer and network architect at Intel, explained that MeshMark is a cloud-native value measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With MeshMark, you&amp;#x27;re essentially trying to measure if the performance of your infrastructure matches what kind of business value you want to get from your deployment,&amp;quot; Ganguli said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A business value could be defined with key performance indicators on, for example, how well video gets loaded on a particular webpage, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you click on something, you may often see the text get rendered first and then the video,&amp;quot; Ganguli said. &amp;quot;The load latency of the video traffic is what impacts what you see visually.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshMark aims to provide metrics that an organization can use to determine how resources are being used. Ganguli said that in a cloud-native environment an organization is utilizing different kinds of resources. The utilization classes include, for example, compute or network or any other type of resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshMark provides an efficiency metric called Mesh Utilization Efficiency (MUE) that can help determine a score for a given resource utilization and the level of optimization. The MeshMark score will be able to help identify what the load latency is for a given workload, given the available resources. Overall, the goal with MeshMark is to take a number of different signals coming from a service mesh and combine them into an approach that can help organizations understand how well a deployment is, or isn&amp;#x27;t, working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The need to better understand the performance of service meshes was further underscored by a report released on May 17 by the CNCF. The report found that 60% of surveyed organizations are using a service mesh in production today — and that key challenges for deployment of service meshes are a lack of guidance, blueprints, and best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[MeshMark: the Cloud Native Value Measurement]]></title><description><![CDATA[Layer5, a provider of cloud native management software, announced today the general availability of the Meshery Docker Extension.

As such, it now makes more sense to enable contributors working on both Istio and Kubernetes to work more closely with one another, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to apply to become an incubation project comes on the heels of the donation of Knative, an open source middleware for connecting Kubernetes clusters to serverless computing frameworks—also originally created by Google—to the CNCF. Assuming the CNCF accepts the Istio contribution, the three major cloud-native initiatives led by Google would all be governed under the auspices of a CNCF consortium that requires organizations to give up control over the trademarks attached to any open source project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan says IT organizations should expect to see ongoing innovation in the months ahead as competition between various service mesh platforms intensifies. At the same time, there may be opportunities to share advances across multiple service meshes being governed by the CNCF. Those service meshes currently include Linkerd, originally developed by Buoyant, and Kuma, originally developed by Kong, Inc. The CNCF is also home to a Meshery framework for managing service meshes created by Layer5 and a Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project originally created by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service meshes initially emerged as a way to manage APIs at scale instead of relying on proxy software or an API gateway alone. More recently, IT organizations have started to appreciate the programmable layer of abstraction that a service mesh creates above lower-level networking and security interfaces. That layer of abstraction makes those underlying services more accessible to developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition between service mesh platforms revolves around two core issues. Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio’s advocates argue that it’s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Top 12 CNCF Sandbox Projects of 2021]]></title><link>https://layer5.io/company/news/the-top-12-cncf-sandbox-projects-of-2021</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/company/news/the-top-12-cncf-sandbox-projects-of-2021</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[TechGenix]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 12:15:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/abf5f4cf9b2c509696212a4a40922083/tech-genix-cover.jpg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Newsstyle__NewsWrapper-sc-12r6uiw-0 bzJNOf&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work with container technology and cloud platforms, it is nearly impossible to not have heard of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
The CNCF organization promotes innovations in accessible container technology by supporting open-source, vendor-neutral projects in the cloud-native ecosystem.
Its first, and perhaps most famous, project was the container orchestration platform Kubernetes, which has continued to lead and shape the industry.
Since then, CNCF has continued to develop open-source tools, standards, and resources that have formed the core of the cloud strategy of hundreds of organizations around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CNCF’s technical oversight committee (TOC) meets regularly to vote to decide which projects are accepted into the foundation.
Projects are ranked according to three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated — listed in increasing order of maturity.
The criteria for each maturity level depends on adoption by end users, quality of end products, and adherence to standards for security, governance, committers, and infrastructure.
Sandbox projects are usually projects in the early stages of development that show promise.
I’ve gathered some of the rising Sandbox projects added by the CNCF in 2021 for you, so that you can take a look at the tools that are driving the future of cloud native technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Meshery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; was created by &lt;a href=&quot;/company/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and joined the ranks of the CNCF in October 2021 as the cloud native mananagement plane. As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud native infrastructure.&lt;p&gt;Meshery gives you a plane to set up, deploy, and benchmark several configuration options available on the market. With Meshery, you can apply custom configurations based on industry best practices to your infrastructure and monitor its performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analyzing Service Mesh Performance]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learn how to effectively analyze and optimize service mesh performance to enhance your cloud-native infrastructure.

However, it’s challenging to manage a sea of disparate microservices. It’s specifically difficult to consistently apply standard features such as traffic management, security and observability mechanisms across all microservices. This issue grows as the number of microservices climbs into the hundreds and thousands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where service mesh comes in. Service mesh helps to apply common observability and security features across applications. It’s typically split into a control plane, used to configure features, and a data plane, consisting of a sidecar proxy alongside each application. Nowadays, several service mesh options exist in the market, each with varying levels of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is home to much of today’s innovative cloud-native technology. The foundation now hosts a few service meshes and related projects.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure”, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. “Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of  service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;standard benchmarks of service mesh performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.”, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. “SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/smp-meshery-6f64e8445e9156f17ba3eca28c081ab7.webp&quot; alt=&quot;SMP in Meshery&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;object-fit:contain;margin:20px 0px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking”, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. “Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments”. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. “An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change“, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Partnership with University of Texas at Austin, Intel, HashiCorp, and Red Hat engineers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More than performance, in collaboration with our maintainers from Layer5, Intel, Red Hat, and HashiCorp, we are actively standardizing service mesh value measurement in the form of a new index to be announced early next year”, said Calcote. “As a foundation for this research, 5,000 service mesh performance tests donated by users of Meshery have been donated and are under analysis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance tests are run by Meshery, the open source, multi-mesh manager. Meshery is the canonical implementation of Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and the conformance tool of Service Mesh Interface (SMI). Meshery implements and helps users adopt and vendors uphold these specifications. A jointly authored paper on service mesh performance methodologies will be published by the IEEE later this month, which explores how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much operators value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, and latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Performance Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io/subscribe&quot;&gt;Community Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Discussion Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrncjtPpg4&amp;amp;list=PL3A-A6hPO2INwi8A3NNClvdCxDoHa9NOU&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Layer5&lt;/h3&gt;Layer5 offers cloud native application management by harnessing the unique position service meshes have in changing how developers write applications, how operators run modern infrastructure and how product owners manage their service offerings.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure&amp;quot;, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. &amp;quot;Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io/&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;standard benchmarks of service mesh performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh&amp;#x27;s efficiency against deployments in other organizations&amp;#x27; environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.&amp;quot;, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. &amp;quot;SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;height:auto&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/smp-fbf44036f1edbc12671349a63c6cbde6.webp&quot; alt=&quot;SMP in Meshery&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; style=&quot;object-fit:contain;margin:20px 0px&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking&amp;quot;, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. &amp;quot;Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments&amp;quot;. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. &amp;quot;An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change&amp;quot;, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
