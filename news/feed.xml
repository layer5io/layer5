<p>
[Salt Lake City, UT] [KubeCon + CloudNativeCon] - November 14th, 2024 – <Link to="/">Layer5</Link>, the open source company behind the popular <a href="https://meshery.io">Meshery</a> project, announces Kanvas, a new collaboration platform that is like Google Workspace, but designed for engineering teams.
</p>

<a href={KanvasScreenshot}><img src={KanvasScreenshot} alt="Layer5 Kanvas Designer" width="100%" className="block-display align-center" /></a>

<p><a href="https://kanvas.new/">Kanvas</a> is a multi-modal collaboration suite built atop one of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation’s highest velocity open source projects: Meshery. Kanvas’s two modes, Designer and Operator, offer declarative and imperative DevOps workflows, respectively. Both modes provide a visual interface for creating and managing complex cloud native infrastructure, expediting collaborative problem-solving, brainstorming and innovation, engineer onboarding, and auto-documented infrastructure. Importantly, Kanvas helps teams avoid finger-pointing and the blame-game by allowing them to be on the same page - literally.</p>

<BlockquoteAlt 
  quote="Partnering on Dapr’s integration with Meshery has been eye-opening. Kanvas promotes collaboration in the design and discussion of cloud native applications, eliminating misunderstandings between teams. It is a game-changer for how we navigate the complexities of relationships between system components"
  person="Mauricio Salatino"
  title="Software Engineer at Diagrid and author of Platform Engineering on Kubernetes"
  />

<p>
As an extensible, self-service engineering platform with hundreds of technology integrations, supporting multi-cloud and Kubernetes native infrastructure, Meshery is the ideal management platform upon which to build Kanvas’ novel collaboration experience. Meshery has thousands of pre-built components supporting Kubernetes and Cloud services and with over 2,000 contributors, Meshery is the 9th fastest growing CNCF (out of 200+ projects).
</p>


<Blockquote
  quote="Internal developer platforms, like Meshery, are rising in popularity, because engineering teams remain siloed with disparate tooling, inconsistent workflow, lack of collaboration and shared process. A lack of collaboration plagues engineering teams with 83% of IT organizations implementing DevOps practices. 62% of organizations are stuck mid-DevOps evolution, teams tightly coupled and responsibilities diffused. Engineering teams desperately need to collaborate, but lack tooling specifically designed for cloud native infrastructure."

<div> 

The open source Kubernetes cloud native project is out today with release of version 1.29, codenamed Mandala. 

The Kubernetes 1.29 milestone is the final release for 2023 for the open source cloud native technology and introduces a range of new features and enhancements. Kubernetes has multiple updates this year, the new release follows the Kubernetes 1.28 update that came out in August.

Dubbed the “Mandala” release after the cosmic circular artwork, Kubernetes v1.29 reflects the project’s interconnected community of contributors. The release was shepherded by a 40-person release team and saw participation from 888 companies and 1,422 individuals over 14 weeks.

Among the major additions in this version are 11 features promoted to stable release status for general availability. This includes the new ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode that ensures only one pod can read/write a volume, node volume expansion secret support for container storage interface (CSI)  drivers and encryption at rest using KMS v2.

Nineteen features have entered beta, highlighting improvements to scheduling, node lifecycle management  and cleaning up legacy service account tokens. Some of the new alpha functionality includes better pod affinity rules, an nftables backend for kube-proxy networking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes Services.

<h3>Networking improvements in Kubernetes 1.29</h3>

Kubernetes 1.29 multiple networking improvements. The new Kubernetes release will be the first to benefit from the new gateway API that helps to improve overall connectivity.

Sidecar containers also get a major boost. <Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote/bio">Lee Calcote</Link>, founder of <Link to ="/company/about">Layer5</Link> and a CNCF contributor told  SDxCentral that Kubernetes 1.28 introduced the concept of a sidecar container – a restartable init container. The concept of a sidecar has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. He noted that sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies in service meshes or for logging or running other auxiliary services to the main container.

“Until 1.28, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support, and beginning now in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers, the kubelet (Kubernete node agent) will delay sending a termination signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated,” Calcote said. “Also new in 1.29 is the behavior of sidecar containers being terminated in reverse of the order in which they were initialized, so that they may continue to offer their services up to the very end of the Pod’s lifecycle.”

The open-source Kubernetes cloud-native platform is out with its second major update of 2023, introducing a long list of enhancements for operators in the new 1.28 release.

Kubernetes is an open-source project, originally started by Google and now developed under the Linux Foundation’s Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), benefiting from the contributions of more than 900 companies. Among the updates in Kubernetes 1.28 are enhancements designed to help with resiliency, including the ability to recover from non-graceful node shutdowns. There are also a series of networking-related enhancements that will enable better security and performance.

As is the case with every Kubernetes release, there is a theme and a code name; for Kubernetes 1.28 the name is “Planternetes.” “So in the northern hemisphere, it’s summer right now and I think the symbolism of the garden and our community goes hand in hand,” Grace Nguyen, release lead for Kubernetes 1.28, told SDxCentral. “Each of us has a very important role in the ecosystem and together we built this big, open-source project that has a lot of impact.”

<h3>Networking enhancements in Kubernetes 1.28</h3>
Looking specifically at the networking capabilities of Kubernetes 1.28, there are a few enhancements that will also help to improve overall performance.
<br></br>
<br></br>

<Link to="/community/members/lee-calcote/bio">Lee Calcote</Link>, founder of <Link to="/about">Layer5</Link> and a CNCF contributor, explained that one of the key networking updates is an enhancement to the kube-proxy feature that will enable better connection-draining capabilities for load balancers targeting terminating nodes.

“This enhancement improves the reliability of load balancer health checks and connection draining for terminating nodes within Kubernetes, so that kube-proxy can independently report its health regardless of the terminating state of the node,” Calcote told SDxCentral. “In this way, cloud providers in particular can be more sophisticated in ascertaining if a load balancer should target a specific node for ingress traffic or not.”

Also of note in Kubernetes 1.28 for networking is IPv4 to IPv6 dual-stack transition support for Kubernetes pods. Calcote explained that this enhancement allows pods to access information about both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the node they are running on, thereby enhancing their ability to adapt to dual-stack network transitions.

Cloud-native networking beyond Kubernetes
While Kubernetes has many built-in capabilities, extensibility of the platform is a key attribute as well.

Calcote explained that proxies running in Kubernetes are quite powerful and many support on-the-fly insertion or removal of traffic filters as plugins, with technologies like Envoy, Traefik, and NGINX as prime examples. He noted that each technology varies in support for the chaining of multiple filters and for the programming languages in which developers can create these filters. Envoy, in particular, supports WebAssembly (WASM)-based filters, which means that a number of different languages are supported.

“Kubernetes has yet to address this deeper area of network traffic management, which is where CNCF projects like <a href="https://meshery.io/">Meshery</a> step in with WASM filter management for any Envoy proxy or Envoy-based service-mesh data plane,” he said.

Kubernetes 1.28 has deep roots for stability
Nguyen noted that there are some 45 enhancements in the Kubernetes 1.28 update, spanning new stable, beta and alpha capabilities.

Kubernetes is widely deployed on public cloud providers and is also used as the foundation of several commercial offerings, including one from IBM‘s Red Hat business unit.

“The latest release of Kubernetes has a number of enhancements to help increase the stability, performance and maintainability of the core platform while also augmenting workload innovation, including AI [artificial intelligence] and virtual machines,” Karena Angell, OpenShift Commons lead and senior principal product manager for Red Hat OpenShift and Hybrid Platforms, told SDxCentral.

Angell said Red Hat is particularly interested in the new node system memory swap support that has been added to Kubernetes 1.28 to enable better memory performance across a cluster. Additionally, she noted that the Kubernetes Job API now allows for more choices in AI model training and retraining, which is especially key for AI-driven and intelligent workloads.

“As Kubernetes continues to mature as a platform with release 1.28, we’re very happy to see a number of new features and tweaks that further support production stability and consistency,” Angell said. “Large and complicated jobs can now fail faster and more accurately which, while it sounds strange, contributes to better overall performance of Kubernetes in production.”

Other projects that help extend Kubernetes to the edge include Akri, OpenYurt and SuperEdge. Other tools aid in provisioning K8s on bare metal, such as Metal3.io and Tinkerbell.
<br /> <br />

### The Forecast Looks Cloud-Native
<br />
By 2023, the <Link to="https://containerjournal.com/features/majority-of-apps-will-use-cloud-native-development-by-2023/">majority of applications will be cloud-native</Link>. The cloud-native world is here to stay, and open source is the foundation to support our new era of microservices, containerization and DevOps.

Although you could technically self-host your way through development and operations using these open source projects, organizations will most likely adopt a blend of open source, proprietary and as-a-service cloud offerings to get the job done. Regardless, it’s cool to know what’s available for free use.

It should also be mentioned that tools change from time to time. As such, you can always view the up-to-date CNCF landscape here. Stay tuned as we keep an eye on CNCF and related bodies that continue to carry the cloud-native torch forward!

<div className="test">

The open source Service Mesh Performance project is getting a new metric called MeshMark to help organizations manage and measure cloud-native environments. In cloud-native environments, the use of service mesh technologies to connect different operations is a growing trend. What isn't always clear with a service mesh though is how well it's actually working.

MeshMark, an open source effort jointly announced by Intel and service mesh startup Layer5 on May 18, looks to help organizations measure and quantify the performance and value of a service mesh deployment. MeshMark is part of the Service Mesh Performance project at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which hosted its ServiceMeshCon EU event on May 18, co-located alongside KubeCon EU 2022.

"We're missing some performance characteristics," Lee Calcote, founder and CEO of Layer5 and co-chair of the CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network, said during a ServiceMeshCon EU session. "We have a need for a clear and concise way of conveying the characters and the performance of an environment."

<h3>MeshMark Brings Metrics to Cloud-Native Service Mesh</h3>

The Service Mesh Performance project at its core is an effort to define specifications for capturing the details of a cloud-native environment in a uniform and consistent way, according to Calcote. In cloud-native environments, the use of service mesh technologies to connect different operations is a growing trend. What isn't always clear with a service mesh though is how well it's actually working.

MeshMark, an open source effort jointly announced by Intel and service mesh startup Layer5 on May 18, looks to help organizations measure and quantify the performance and value of a service mesh deployment. MeshMark is part of the Service Mesh Performance project at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which hosted its ServiceMeshCon EU event on May 18, co-located alongside KubeCon EU 2022.

"We're missing some performance characteristics," Lee Calcote, founder and CEO of Layer5 and co-chair of the CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network, said during a ServiceMeshCon EU session. "We have a need for a clear and concise way of conveying the characters and the performance of an environment."

The Service Mesh Performance project looks at capturing infrastructure and service mesh configuration details and then providing a means to characterize the details of running workloads. The project also aims to provide the details in a consistent approach that can enable organizations to develop a baseline for an environment, as well as benchmark in a consistent way. Simply being aware of what's running in a service mesh isn't quite enough though, and there is a need for a performance metric, which is where the new MeshMark effort comes into play. Mrittika Ganguli, principal engineer and network architect at Intel, explained that MeshMark is a cloud-native value measurement.

"With MeshMark, you're essentially trying to measure if the performance of your infrastructure matches what kind of business value you want to get from your deployment," Ganguli said.

A business value could be defined with key performance indicators on, for example, how well video gets loaded on a particular webpage, she said.

"If you click on something, you may often see the text get rendered first and then the video," Ganguli said. "The load latency of the video traffic is what impacts what you see visually."

MeshMark aims to provide metrics that an organization can use to determine how resources are being used. Ganguli said that in a cloud-native environment an organization is utilizing different kinds of resources. The utilization classes include, for example, compute or network or any other type of resource.

MeshMark provides an efficiency metric called Mesh Utilization Efficiency (MUE) that can help determine a score for a given resource utilization and the level of optimization. The MeshMark score will be able to help identify what the load latency is for a given workload, given the available resources. Overall, the goal with MeshMark is to take a number of different signals coming from a service mesh and combine them into an approach that can help organizations understand how well a deployment is, or isn't, working.

The need to better understand the performance of service meshes was further underscored by a report released on May 17 by the CNCF. The report found that 60% of surveyed organizations are using a service mesh in production today — and that key challenges for deployment of service meshes are a lack of guidance, blueprints, and best practices.

VALENCIA, Spain (May 17th, 2022) - ServiceMeshCon EU /KubeCon EU - <a href="https://smp-spec.io/meshmark">MeshMark</a> is a performance index that measures the <i>value</i> and <i>overhead</i> of your cloud native environment. By converting performance measurements into insights about the value of individual, cloud native application networking functions, MeshMark distills a variety of overhead signals and key performance indicators into a simple index to facilitate quick and common comprehension.

<p>
By specifying a uniform way to analyze and report on the degree to which measured performance provides business value, MeshMark converts these metrics into insights about the efficiency and value of the functions your cloud native infrastructure is providing to your applications and services.
</p>

<h2>Service Mesh Performance, the project</h2>
<p>
<Link to="/company/news/cncf-adopts-service-mesh-performance-standard-established-by-layer5">Adopted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)</Link> in October of 2021, <Link to="/projects/cloud-native-performance">Service Mesh Performance</Link> is an open source standard for service mesh efficiency, a growing consideration for cloud native operators and developers utilizing a service mesh in their infrastructure. With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.
</p>

<Blockquote 
  quote="Many cloud native adopters have been put off from using service mesh due to the extra resource consumption and complexity that it can involve. We welcome MeshMark as an objective measure of that overhead, to help drive efficiency and make it easier for users to compare service mesh options."

<h2>MeshMark, the formula</h2>
<Blockquote className="pull-right"
  quote="Are my resources utilized as best as possible? Why am I not getting the SLO met with 4 resources when I only needed 1 resource without the service mesh?

<p>
MeshMark functions as a value performance index (a scale) to provide organizations the ability to weigh the value of their service mesh versus the overhead of their service mesh and assess whether they are getting out of the mesh what they are “paying” for in it. MeshMark’s scoring system ranges from 0 to 100 and incorporates collections of resource utilization efficiency calculations, categorized into similar consumption classes.

import { NewsWrapper } from "../../News.style.js";

<NewsWrapper>

Google and the Istio Steering Committee today announced at an IstioCon 22 event that they have submitted the open source Istio service mesh for consideration to become an incubating project administered by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

Previously, Google and the Istio Steering Committee had, for unspecified reasons, declined to donate the Istio service mesh to the CNCF even though the CNCF governs both the Kubernetes orchestration platform and Envoy proxy software upon which Istio depends.

Louis Ryan, a principal engineer for Google, says since then, the Istio project has matured while the Kubernetes community simultaneously advanced the development of a network application programming interface (API) that makes it simpler for service meshes to abstract away the underlying complexity associated with programmatically invoking network services. As such, it now makes more sense to enable contributors working on both Istio and Kubernetes to work more closely with one another, he adds.

The decision to apply to become an incubation project comes on the heels of the donation of Knative, an open source middleware for connecting Kubernetes clusters to serverless computing frameworks—also originally created by Google—to the CNCF. Assuming the CNCF accepts the Istio contribution, the three major cloud-native initiatives led by Google would all be governed under the auspices of a CNCF consortium that requires organizations to give up control over the trademarks attached to any open source project.

Ryan says IT organizations should expect to see ongoing innovation in the months ahead as competition between various service mesh platforms intensifies. At the same time, there may be opportunities to share advances across multiple service meshes being governed by the CNCF. Those service meshes currently include Linkerd, originally developed by Buoyant, and Kuma, originally developed by Kong, Inc. The CNCF is also home to a Meshery framework for managing service meshes created by Layer5 and a Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project originally created by Microsoft.

Service meshes initially emerged as a way to manage APIs at scale instead of relying on proxy software or an API gateway alone. More recently, IT organizations have started to appreciate the programmable layer of abstraction that a service mesh creates above lower-level networking and security interfaces. That layer of abstraction makes those underlying services more accessible to developers.

Competition between service mesh platforms revolves around two core issues. Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio’s advocates argue that it’s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines.

Regardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow.

If you work with container technology and cloud platforms, it is nearly impossible to not have heard of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). 
The CNCF organization promotes innovations in accessible container technology by supporting open-source, vendor-neutral projects in the cloud-native ecosystem.
Its first, and perhaps most famous, project was the container orchestration platform Kubernetes, which has continued to lead and shape the industry.
Since then, CNCF has continued to develop open-source tools, standards, and resources that have formed the core of the cloud strategy of hundreds of organizations around the globe.

The CNCF’s technical oversight committee (TOC) meets regularly to vote to decide which projects are accepted into the foundation.
Projects are ranked according to three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated — listed in increasing order of maturity.
The criteria for each maturity level depends on adoption by end users, quality of end products, and adherence to standards for security, governance, committers, and infrastructure.
Sandbox projects are usually projects in the early stages of development that show promise.
I’ve gathered some of the rising Sandbox projects added by the CNCF in 2021 for you, so that you can take a look at the tools that are driving the future of cloud native technology.

<h3>8. Meshery</h3>
<Link to="/cloud-native-management/meshery">Meshery</Link> was created by <Link to ="/company/about">Layer5</Link> and joined the ranks of the CNCF in October 2021 as the cloud native mananagement plane. As a self-service engineering platform, Meshery enables collaborative design and operation of cloud native infrastructure.

Meshery gives you a plane to set up, deploy, and benchmark several configuration options available on the market. With Meshery, you can apply custom configurations based on industry best practices to your infrastructure and monitor its performance.

As a forthcoming, ubiquitous layer of cloud native infrastructure, service meshes offer deep and uniform control and visibility into the topology and state of ephemeral microservices. Managing the myriad configurations of cloud native infrastructure is greatly facilitated by a service mesh, but succinctly summarizing and characterizing the performance of your service mesh in context of your unique workloads and your infrastructure of choice is a challenge unto its own.

We explore how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before you deploy to production. Readers will understand how distributed performance analysis offers unique insights on the behavior of microservices and their efficiency of operation, see examples of how common types of workloads perform under specific service mesh functions, and be empowered with analytical tooling that can be used to make optimized configurations.

Microservices have grown tremendously in use—they enable decoupled, reusable components and support a rapid development approach. However, it’s challenging to manage a sea of disparate microservices. It’s specifically difficult to consistently apply standard features such as traffic management, security and observability mechanisms across all microservices. This issue grows as the number of microservices climbs into the hundreds and thousands.

This is where service mesh comes in. Service mesh helps to apply common observability and security features across applications. It’s typically split into a control plane, used to configure features, and a data plane, consisting of a sidecar proxy alongside each application. Nowadays, several service mesh options exist in the market, each with varying levels of complexity.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is home to much of today’s innovative cloud-native technology. The foundation now hosts a few service meshes and related projects. Below, we’ll outline the CNCF service mesh toolset to better understand how engineers can adopt these tools and their benefits.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced this week during the ServiceMeshCon/KubeCon + CloudNativeCon conference that Meshery, a service mesh management plane created by Layer5, has become a sandbox-level project.

In addition, Layer5 has also donated Service Mesh Performance (SMP), a set of tools for measuring the efficiency of a service mesh, to the CNCF. SMP provides an open source framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations and measurements as part of an effort to create a MeshMark index for rating a service mesh. A set of service mesh performance methodologies will also be published by the IEEE later this month, developed in collaboration with engineers from Layer5, Intel, Red Hat and HashiCorp.

Layer5 CEO Lee Calcote said the goal is to make it simpler for IT teams to determine which service mesh to employ based on their specific use case requirements.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 13, 2021 - ServiceMeshCon/KubeCon + CloudNativeCon: Layer5 today announced Service Mesh Performance, an open source standard for service mesh efficiency, a growing consideration for cloud native operators and developers utilizing a service mesh in their infrastructure. With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.

“We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure”, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. “Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of  service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.”

<h3>Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement</h3>

<a href="https://smp-spec.io">Service Mesh Performance</a> is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.
<ol>
    <li>the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.</li>
    <li>standard benchmarks of service mesh performance</li>
    <li>common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh</li>
    <li>apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.</li>
    <li>a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.</li>
</ol>

<p>"A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.”, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. “SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements."
</p>

<h3>CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project</h3>

With multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.

“As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking”, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. “Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments”. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. “An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change“, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.


<h3>Partnership with University of Texas at Austin, Intel, HashiCorp, and Red Hat engineers</h3>

“More than performance, in collaboration with our maintainers from Layer5, Intel, Red Hat, and HashiCorp, we are actively standardizing service mesh value measurement in the form of a new index to be announced early next year”, said Calcote. “As a foundation for this research, 5,000 service mesh performance tests donated by users of Meshery have been donated and are under analysis.” 

Performance tests are run by Meshery, the open source, multi-mesh manager. Meshery is the canonical implementation of Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and the conformance tool of Service Mesh Interface (SMI). Meshery implements and helps users adopt and vendors uphold these specifications. A jointly authored paper on service mesh performance methodologies will be published by the IEEE later this month, which explores how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much operators value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, and latency.

<p>Layer5 announced Service Mesh Performance, an open source standard for service mesh efficiency, a growing consideration for cloud native operators and developers utilizing a service mesh in their infrastructure. With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.</p>

<p>"We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure", said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. "Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes."</p>

<h4>Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement</h4>
<p><a href="https://smp-spec.io/">Service Mesh Performance</a> is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.</p>

<ol>
  <li>the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.
  </li>
  <li>standard benchmarks of service mesh performance</li>
  <li>common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh</li>
  <li>apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.</li>
  <li>a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh's efficiency against deployments in other organizations' environments.</li>
</ol>

<p>"A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.", said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. "SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements."</p>

import { NewsWrapper } from "../../News.style.js";

Both the Meshery and Service Mesh Performance (SMP) projects joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) earlier this month at the Sandbox level.

Meshery is a multiservice mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads, while SMP is a standard for capturing and characterizing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.

When the projects first applied in April for inclusion, the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) had one clarifying question for them: should they be combined with or aligned in some manner with the Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project?

Lee Calcote, founder of Layer5, the company partly behind both of the projects, explained that it was an alluring prospect for the CNCF, but that, for the time being at least, the projects would continue on their own separate paths.

Calcote, who also serves as the chair of the Network special interest group (SIG) at the CNCF, said he then presented to the CNCF the following diagram, which shows the relation between the three projects. For the time being, he said, both SMI and SMP are “relatively younger projects, both of which still are figuring out what they want to be when they grow up,” and may be considered for consolidation later on down the line, while Meshery has a larger focus than the two projects and will definitely be kept on its own.

While the SMI works to define the broadest characteristics that could apply to something defined as a service mesh, looking for the lowest common denominator, Meshery works in the opposite direction, trying to accentuate the differences and strengths of the individual services meshes. SMP, meanwhile, is more of a specification and works to provide a common format for capturing and describing data around the performance of the service mesh itself.

In comparison to SMI, Calcote said that “SMP essentially just goes a lot deeper. Part of what is trying to address is this long-standing question — and it’s a question that faces the people who are adopting a service mesh today, people who are adopting service mesh tomorrow, people who have already adopted a service mesh — What should I be measuring to consider how efficiently I’m running my service mesh?”

Between the three projects, then, users have not just a way to interface with any SMI-compatible service mesh via a common API, but also a way to measure the performance of different service meshes, and finally, a method with which to interface with and operate those service meshes while taking advantage of their specific advantages.

“Part of the belief is that service meshes are an inevitable new layer in your cloud native infrastructure that over time will be a ubiquitous component,” said Calcote. “There’s a lot that can be done in the network, a lot of intelligence, and so Meshery, as a management plane, picks off some of those features.”

DevOps teams use the right tools to automate deployment plans to minimize risk to the product and customer experience. These service mesh tools also provide synchronization with web communication standards, adapted to varying security protocols, and offer better management.

## Here are some lesser-known Kubernetes service mesh tools:

**Autopilot:** Autopilot is a toolkit and SDK used for deploying and developing service mesh operators. It is developed by Solo.io, a service connectivity company. This service was launched in late-2019. The service allows its users to automate the service mesh interface for chaos experimentation, adaptive security, canary automation, and more.

**Consul:** Consul, a service mesh solution, has a full-featured control plane. It was first released in 2014 and developed by HashiCorp. This service mesh can be installed and configured on an existing Kubernetes cluster. Its latest version is 1.9.5 that was released on April 15, 2021

**OSM:** Open Service Mesh (OSM) is an open-source service mesh created by Microsoft that supports the Kubernetes environment. It is a cloud-native service mesh that allows users to manage and secure service meshes consistently. It also offers out-of-the-box observability features for dynamic microservice environments.

**Layer5:** Layer5 is a service mesh company and a worldwide community that offers a large collection of service mesh projects. The community creates and maintains several projects that focus on the service mesh-centric capabilities in a cloud-based environment.
The key projects operating under the Layer5 community include: `Meshery`, `Learn Layer5`, `Service Mesh Landscape`, `Image Hub`, `Meshery Operator`, `Service Mesh Interface Conformance`, and `NightHawk`.

**Kuma:** Kuma is an open-source service mesh that provides support for multiple environments across clouds, such as Kubernetes and virtual machines. It was created by Kong, and it was recently added to CNCF as a Sandbox project. Moreover, Kuma is production-ready, and it is still under active development.

"Cloud native" doesn't just mean "running in the cloud." It's a specific deployment paradigm and uses containers and an orchestration system (usually Kubernetes) to help provision, schedule, run and control a production workload in the cloud, or even across multiple clouds. Within cloud native deployments, an increasingly common approach to networking is the service mesh concept. With a service mesh, instead of each individual container requiring a full networking stack, a grouping of containers all benefit from a mesh that provides connectivity and networking with other containers as well as the outside world.

Service mesh in the wild
While the concept of a service mesh has applicability beyond just Kubernetes deployments, that's arguably where the vast majority of deployments are today. Among the earliest cloud-native service mesh approaches is the open source Linkerd project, which is backed by Buoyant and began to really ramp up adoption in 2017.

Over the past three years there has been an explosion of open source service mesh technology. Layer5, which develops service mesh aggregation technology, currently tracks over 20 different open and closed source mesh projects. Beyond Linkerd, among the most popular is the Google-backed Istio project, which recently hit its 1.8 milestone release. Cisco has backed the Network Service Mesh (NSM) effort, which works at a lower level in the networking stack than Linkerd, Istio and most others.

Each mesh has its own take on configuration and capabilities, which is a good thing for users. Simply put, there is no shortage of options and there is likely to be a service mesh that already exists to meet just about any need.

Service mesh abstraction
While having lots of different service mesh technologies is good for choice, it's not necessarily a good thing for simplicity or interoperability. That's where the concept of service mesh abstraction comes into play.

At the recent KubeCon NA 2020 virtual event, Lee Calcote, co-chair of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) and founder of Layer5, outlined how the different service mesh abstraction technologies fit together.

The Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a way for any compliant service mesh to plug into Kubernetes. The Service Mesh Performance (SMP) abstraction is all about providing visibility into service mesh performance though a common interface. The third key abstraction is known as Hamlet and it provides multi-vendor service interoperation and mesh federation capabilities.

Service mesh benefits
There are a number of different benefits that service meshes can bring, which are helping to accelerate adoption. Calcote explained that with a service mesh there is a decoupling of developer and operations teams such that each can iterate independently.

As such, operators can make changes to infrastructure independent of developers. DevOps is supposed to mean developer and operations teams work together, but the reality is often quite different and the ability to build application and infrastructure separately is why service mesh has been such a winning proposition for so many organizations.

"We live within a software defined network landscape, and service meshes in some respects are sort of a next-gen SDN," Calcote said.

As more organizations implement service meshes, they are finding what works and what needs more work, and they are creating new management practices around this knowledge. A few tried-and-tested best practices were detailed last month during KubeCon+CloudNativeCon.

“There’s a lot to say about each of these service meshes and how they work: their architecture, why they’re made, what they’re focused on, what they do when they came about and why some of them aren’t here anymore and why we’re still seeing new ones,” Lee Calcote, founder of Layer5, explained during his talk entitled “Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter in Your Deployment.”

Service mesh is increasingly seen as a requirement to manage microservices in Kubernetes environments, offering a central control plane to manage microservices access, testing, metrics and other functionalities. One-third of the respondents in The New Stack survey of our readers said their organizations already use service mesh. Among the numerous service mesh options available; Envoy, Istio, Linkerd and Kuma are but a few on offer.

### Interoperability Is Key as Service Meshes Come and Go

Organizations will likely look to use at least more than one API service layer and service mesh for their clusters. This is why interoperability, and thus specifications, are critical for control planes as well. During his talk — “Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter in Your Deployment” mentioned above — for example, Calcote, asked rhetorically:

“How many specifications, how many standards are there that have come to the rescue, so to speak, for understanding and interoperating with the various service meshes that are out there?” Calcote said.

<a href={serviceMeshAbstractions}><img src={serviceMeshAbstractions} alt="service-mesh-abstractions" width="100%" /></a>

A service mesh can be used for testing router performance, service latency and other variables. However, determining service mesh performance in an apples-to-apples way can be challenging. When studying “published results from some of the service meshes [from providers] that do publish results about performance… what you’ll find is that they’re probably using an environment that isn’t necessarily like yours,” Calcote said. “They’re also using different statistics and metrics to measure [their service meshes] … and it doesn’t help.”

<a href={serviceMeshPerformance}><img src={serviceMeshPerformance} alt="service-mesh-performance" width="100%" /></a>

Service mesh performance (SMP) was created in an attempt to establish a way of comparing the performance of different services. “The SMP was born in combination with engaging with a few of those different service mesh maintainers and creating a standard way of articulating a performance of a mesh,” Calcote said.

Among the variables in consideration, in addition to the service mesh itself, include the number of clusters, workloads, the types of nodes, control plan configuration and the use of client libraries all affect performance.

“What costs more, what’s more efficient and what’s more powerful: These are all open questions that SMP assists in answering in your environment,” Calcote said.
