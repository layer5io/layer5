Kubernetes has multiple updates this year, the new release follows the Kubernetes 1.28 update that came out in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the “Mandala” release after the cosmic circular artwork, Kubernetes v1.29 reflects the project’s interconnected community of contributors. The release was shepherded by a 40-person release team and saw participation from 888 companies and 1,422 individuals over 14 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the major additions in this version are 11 features promoted to stable release status for general availability. This includes the new ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode that ensures only one pod can read/write a volume, node volume expansion secret support for container storage interface (CSI)  drivers and encryption at rest using KMS v2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen features have entered beta, highlighting improvements to scheduling, node lifecycle management  and cleaning up legacy service account tokens. Some of the new alpha functionality includes better pod affinity rules, an nftables backend for kube-proxy networking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking improvements in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.29 multiple networking improvements.

And they’re all in one place—look no further than the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).This Linux Foundation body has become a locus of some stellar cloud-native open source projects. The CNCF now hosts an array of helpful packages, spanning container scheduling, observability, persistent storage, container runtime and other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odds are the cloud-native DevOps tool you need has already been developed—it’s only a matter of finding it. In recent posts, we highlighted many CNCF tools across various areas. Below, we’ll gloss over each category from a birds-eye view. Click each headline for the full rundown, or read below for a summary of the tools in each category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Scheduling  Orchestration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kubernetes is the most popular container scheduling tool. It can be used to automate the deployment and management of multi-cloud applications. Other scheduling and orchestration utilities from CNCF include Crossplane, Fluid, Karmada, kube-rs, Open Cluster Management and Volcano.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Observability and Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prometheus tops the list of observability and analysis tools. The platform can be used to power your monitoring and alerting systems with fine-grained metrics and excellent querying capabilities. Other CNCF tools for observability and analysis include Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Cortex and OpenTelemetry.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Security and Compliance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Open Policy Agent (OPA) can be used to unify cloud-native policies across the cloud-native stack. OPA uses a common language to express authorization policies and provides a policy engine to make authorization decisions. Other CNCF projects that deliver security-as-code include The Update Framework (TUF), Falco, Notary, cert-manager and Curiefense.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CI/CD&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Argo is a suite of packages that help direct jobs on Kubernetes to aid a continuous delivery pipeline. Using Argo, developers can create multi-step custom workflows and share these workflows across a cluster. Other CI/CD tools hosted by CNCF include Flux, Brigade, Keptn, OpenGitOps and OpenKruise.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linkerd is a highly performant developer-favorite service mesh comprised of a control plane to apply configurations and a data plane that deploys its own unique proxy. This proxy can apply consistent security, observability, monitoring and telemetry features across distributed microservices. Other service mesh tools from CNCF include Kuma, Open Service Mesh (OSM), &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Interface (SMI) &lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&quot;/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/cloud-native-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance(SMP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Proxies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Envoy is a service proxy commonly used within service meshes like Istio and Kuma. Envoy is intended to run alongside applications to help standardize networking and observability within large microservices networks. Other service proxy projects include Contour BFE and OpenELB.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Persistent Storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rook is a tool that helps automate away some of the pains of managing cloud-native persistent storage. Rook supports file, block and object storage types and can be used for programmatic storage, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring and resource management. Other cloud-native persistent storage projects include Longhorn, CubeFS, K8up, OpenEBS, ORAS, Piraeus Datastore and Vineyard.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud-Native Database Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TiKV is a unified distributed storage layer that can process large amounts of data. The project supports a key-value API and has rapid response times. Other cloud-native database utilities include Vitess, a clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL and SchemaHero, a Kubernetes operator for declarative database schema management.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Container Runtime&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime supported by most container-based systems. Originally built as part of Docker, containerd was donated to the Linux Foundation in 2015. Other notable CNCF container runtime utilities include CRI-O, Inclavare Containers and WasmEdge Runtime.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;App Definition and Build Tools&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Helm is a prevalent Kubernetes package manager widely used to share a manifest of dependencies. Operators often use Helm charts to find and install third-party applications. Other notable tools which help address operational concerns of Kubernetes include Buildpacks, KubeVirt, Operator Framework and Backstage.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud-Native Networking&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cilium is a tool that brings eBPF-based networking, security and observability.

The CNCF organization promotes innovations in accessible container technology by supporting open-source, vendor-neutral projects in the cloud-native ecosystem.
Its first, and perhaps most famous, project was the container orchestration platform Kubernetes, which has continued to lead and shape the industry.
Since then, CNCF has continued to develop open-source tools, standards, and resources that have formed the core of the cloud strategy of hundreds of organizations around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CNCF’s technical oversight committee (TOC) meets regularly to vote to decide which projects are accepted into the foundation.
Projects are ranked according to three maturity levels: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated — listed in increasing order of maturity.
The criteria for each maturity level depends on adoption by end users, quality of end products, and adherence to standards for security, governance, committers, and infrastructure.
Sandbox projects are usually projects in the early stages of development that show promise.
I’ve gathered some of the rising Sandbox projects added by the CNCF in 2021 for you, so that you can take a look at the tools that are driving the future of cloud native technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure”, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. “Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of  service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;standard benchmarks of service mesh performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.”, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. “SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/smp-meshery-6f64e8445e9156f17ba3eca28c081ab7.webp&quot; alt=&quot;SMP in Meshery&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking”, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. “Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments”. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. “An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change“, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Partnership with University of Texas at Austin, Intel, HashiCorp, and Red Hat engineers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More than performance, in collaboration with our maintainers from Layer5, Intel, Red Hat, and HashiCorp, we are actively standardizing service mesh value measurement in the form of a new index to be announced early next year”, said Calcote. “As a foundation for this research, 5,000 service mesh performance tests donated by users of Meshery have been donated and are under analysis.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performance tests are run by Meshery, the open source, multi-mesh manager. Meshery is the canonical implementation of Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and the conformance tool of Service Mesh Interface (SMI). Meshery implements and helps users adopt and vendors uphold these specifications. A jointly authored paper on service mesh performance methodologies will be published by the IEEE later this month, which explores how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much operators value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, and latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service Mesh Performance Resources&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io/subscribe&quot;&gt;Community Newsletter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Discussion Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/smp_spec&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/service-mesh-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrncjtPpg4&amp;amp;list=PL3A-A6hPO2INwi8A3NNClvdCxDoHa9NOU&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Layer5&lt;/h3&gt;Layer5 offers cloud native application management by harnessing the unique position service meshes have in changing how developers write applications, how operators run modern infrastructure and how product owners manage their service offerings.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure&amp;quot;, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. &amp;quot;Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io/&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;standard benchmarks of service mesh performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh&amp;#x27;s efficiency against deployments in other organizations&amp;#x27; environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.&amp;quot;, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. &amp;quot;SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/smp-fbf44036f1edbc12671349a63c6cbde6.webp&quot; alt=&quot;SMP in Meshery&quot;/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking&amp;quot;, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. &amp;quot;Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments&amp;quot;. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. &amp;quot;An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change&amp;quot;, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[CNCF Projects Bring Service Mesh Interoperability, Benchmarks]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

Simply put, there is no shortage of options and there is likely to be a service mesh that already exists to meet just about any need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh abstraction
While having lots of different service mesh technologies is good for choice, it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily a good thing for simplicity or interoperability. That&amp;#x27;s where the concept of service mesh abstraction comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the recent KubeCon NA 2020 virtual event, Lee Calcote, co-chair of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) and founder of Layer5, outlined how the different service mesh abstraction technologies fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a way for any compliant service mesh to plug into Kubernetes. The Service Mesh Performance (SMP) abstraction is all about providing visibility into service mesh performance though a common interface. The third key abstraction is known as Hamlet and it provides multi-vendor service interoperation and mesh federation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh benefits
There are a number of different benefits that service meshes can bring, which are helping to accelerate adoption. Calcote explained that with a service mesh there is a decoupling of developer and operations teams such that each can iterate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, operators can make changes to infrastructure independent of developers. DevOps is supposed to mean developer and operations teams work together, but the reality is often quite different and the ability to build application and infrastructure separately is why service mesh has been such a winning proposition for so many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We live within a software defined network landscape, and service meshes in some respects are sort of a next-gen SDN,&amp;quot; Calcote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[KubeCon+CloudNativeCon]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];
