MeshMark will model and provide an index in answer to such questions.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;person&quot;&gt;Mrittika Ganguli&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;Principal Engineer &amp;amp; Director Cloud Native Network Pathfinding&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;MeshMark functions as a value performance index (a scale) to provide organizations the ability to weigh the value of their service mesh versus the overhead of their service mesh and assess whether they are getting out of the mesh what they are “paying” for in it. MeshMark’s scoring system ranges from 0 to 100 and incorporates collections of resource utilization efficiency calculations, categorized into similar consumption classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/MeshMark-Formula-2d9704dfd0fe98f83e65c69f644fffd5.png&quot; alt=&quot;MeshMark Formula&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Mesh Utilization Efficiency (MUE) is a calculated, combined ratio of specific infrastructure resource utilizations to assigned resources to cloud native infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-1yeq4hm-0 bFJrJG blockquote&quot; title=&quot;Founder and CEO of Layer5, and Co-Chair of the CNCF TAG Network&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;blockquote-quote&quot;&gt;A sophisticated, but simply communicated value-performance index, MeshMark, redefines efficiency utilization, bringing business, application, and infrastructure KPIs under a single unit of measure.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;blockquote-person&quot;&gt;—Lee Calcote&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;blockquote-title&quot;&gt;Founder and CEO of Layer5, and Co-Chair of the CNCF TAG Network&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn how we distill a variety of microarchitecture performance signals and application key performance indicators into a simple measurement scale.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure”, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. “Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of  service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://smp-spec.io&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt; is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;standard benchmarks of service mesh performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.”, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. “SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/smp-meshery-6d6670922291e90b030f1b684fbcef04.png&quot; alt=&quot;SMP in Meshery&quot;/&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking”, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. “Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments”.

Within cloud native deployments, an increasingly common approach to networking is the service mesh concept. With a service mesh, instead of each individual container requiring a full networking stack, a grouping of containers all benefit from a mesh that provides connectivity and networking with other containers as well as the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh in the wild
While the concept of a service mesh has applicability beyond just Kubernetes deployments, that&amp;#x27;s arguably where the vast majority of deployments are today. Among the earliest cloud-native service mesh approaches is the open source Linkerd project, which is backed by Buoyant and began to really ramp up adoption in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past three years there has been an explosion of open source service mesh technology. Layer5, which develops service mesh aggregation technology, currently tracks over 20 different open and closed source mesh projects. Beyond Linkerd, among the most popular is the Google-backed Istio project, which recently hit its 1.8 milestone release. Cisco has backed the Network Service Mesh (NSM) effort, which works at a lower level in the networking stack than Linkerd, Istio and most others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each mesh has its own take on configuration and capabilities, which is a good thing for users. Simply put, there is no shortage of options and there is likely to be a service mesh that already exists to meet just about any need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh abstraction
While having lots of different service mesh technologies is good for choice, it&amp;#x27;s not necessarily a good thing for simplicity or interoperability. That&amp;#x27;s where the concept of service mesh abstraction comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the recent KubeCon NA 2020 virtual event, Lee Calcote, co-chair of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) and founder of Layer5, outlined how the different service mesh abstraction technologies fit together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a way for any compliant service mesh to plug into Kubernetes. The Service Mesh Performance (SMP) abstraction is all about providing visibility into service mesh performance though a common interface. The third key abstraction is known as Hamlet and it provides multi-vendor service interoperation and mesh federation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service mesh benefits
There are a number of different benefits that service meshes can bring, which are helping to accelerate adoption. Calcote explained that with a service mesh there is a decoupling of developer and operations teams such that each can iterate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, operators can make changes to infrastructure independent of developers. DevOps is supposed to mean developer and operations teams work together, but the reality is often quite different and the ability to build application and infrastructure separately is why service mesh has been such a winning proposition for so many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We live within a software defined network landscape, and service meshes in some respects are sort of a next-gen SDN,&amp;quot; Calcote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[KubeCon+CloudNativeCon]]></title><description><![CDATA[var _excluded = ["components"];

Specific use cases and needs for service meshes also vary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The New Stack recently completed a survey about service mesh use cases. While one third of those surveyed said their organizations already use service meshes to control traffic between microservices and Kubernetes environments, adoption rates and use varied significantly among the respondents. Sixteen percent of respondents said that their organization broadly uses service mesh in production environments and 17% said service meshes have limited use in production environments, for example.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this latest episode of The New Stack Analysts podcast, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, an analyst and founder of service mesh provider &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianredbeard/&quot;&gt;Brian “Redbeard” Harrington&lt;/a&gt;, a principal product manager for OpenShift service mesh at Red Hat, discussed the many nuances of what the survey numbers really mean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;166&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameBorder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/774586579%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-es7L3&amp;amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;amp;auto_play=false&amp;amp;hide_related=false&amp;amp;show_comments=true&amp;amp;show_user=true&amp;amp;show_reposts=false&amp;amp;show_teaser=true&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Calcote notes how traffic management is seen as a key feature among the many different service mesh capabilities, but it’s most useful to advanced users. Speaking about the use of traffic management functionalities, Calcote said: “Folks tend to be a little more advanced as they get into that because they’re at that point they’re actually affecting traffic and then routing requests differently, as opposed to something like just purely observing or getting a ‘read-only’ view in their environment.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
