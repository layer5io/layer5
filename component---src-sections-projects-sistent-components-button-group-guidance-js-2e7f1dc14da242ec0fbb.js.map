The ButtonGroup should also provide visual feedback when a\n            user hovers over a button, to indicate that the button is clickable.\n            Additionally, the ButtonGroup should be accessible via keyboard\n            navigation, and screen readers should be able to read the labels of\n            the buttons within the group.\n          </p>\n          <a id=\"Styling\">\n            <h2>Styling</h2>\n          </a>\n          <p>\n            The ButtonGroup component should be styled in a way that is\n            consistent with the rest of the application. The buttons within the\n            group should be styled in a way that is visually distinct from other\n            buttons on the page, to indicate that they are part of a group. The\n            ButtonGroup should also be styled in a way that is accessible to\n            users with color blindness or low vision. The buttons within the\n            group should have a visible focus state, and the focus should be set\n            to the first button in the group by default.\n          </p>\n          <a id=\"Accessibility\">\n            <h2>Accessibility</h2>\n          </a>\n          <p>\n            The ButtonGroup component should be accessible to all users,\n            including those with disabilities.
