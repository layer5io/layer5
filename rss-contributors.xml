Kubernetes has multiple updates this year, the new release follows the Kubernetes 1.28 update that came out in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the “Mandala” release after the cosmic circular artwork, Kubernetes v1.29 reflects the project’s interconnected community of contributors. The release was shepherded by a 40-person release team and saw participation from 888 companies and 1,422 individuals over 14 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the major additions in this version are 11 features promoted to stable release status for general availability. This includes the new ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode that ensures only one pod can read/write a volume, node volume expansion secret support for container storage interface (CSI)  drivers and encryption at rest using KMS v2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nineteen features have entered beta, highlighting improvements to scheduling, node lifecycle management  and cleaning up legacy service account tokens. Some of the new alpha functionality includes better pod affinity rules, an nftables backend for kube-proxy networking, and managing IP address ranges for Kubernetes Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking improvements in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.29 multiple networking improvements. The new Kubernetes release will be the first to benefit from the new gateway API that helps to improve overall connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sidecar containers also get a major boost. &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote/bio&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;/company/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and a CNCF contributor told  SDxCentral that Kubernetes 1.28 introduced the concept of a sidecar container – a restartable init container. The concept of a sidecar has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. He noted that sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies in service meshes or for logging or running other auxiliary services to the main container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until 1.28, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support, and beginning now in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers, the kubelet (Kubernete node agent) will delay sending a termination signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated,” Calcote said. “Also new in 1.29 is the behavior of sidecar containers being terminated in reverse of the order in which they were initialized, so that they may continue to offer their services up to the very end of the Pod’s lifecycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kubernetes 1.29 Highlights, Features, and Deprecations]]></title><description><![CDATA[Release Notes: What changed in Kubernetes 1.29?]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-129-highlights-features-and-deprecations</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/a4d33a4caec76921f0279be3c71b48ae/kubernetes-new.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the final Kubernetes release of 2023, Kubernetes 1.29 is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/&quot;&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt; of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/cloud-native-performance&quot;&gt;Cloud Native Performance&lt;/a&gt;. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kubernetes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of enhancements tracked in this release (72), you need to be aware that a number of these are code freezes or deprecations in 1.29. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, and important deprecations, so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s breakdown new K8s features between networking and security categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Networking in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io&quot;&gt;Gateway API reaches 1.0&lt;/a&gt; [Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway API has reached v1.0 in between Kubernetes 1.28 and 1.29. The Gateway API is the eventual successor to the Ingress API and significantly augments the Service API. The Kubernetes Service API is one of the oldest and most used APIs in Kubernetes. The Service API, in fact, was present in the very first public commit of Kubernetes in 2014, and almost everyone who deploys workloads in Kubernetes ends up using Services. Nearly ten years later in 2024, While Service API offers a kitchen sink full of functionality, it’s nearly ten year old design is limiting what can be done in Kubernetes networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gateway API takes a fresh approach in offering expressive, extensible, and role-oriented interfaces. Gateway API is expressive and extensible in that it offers core support for advanced traffic management (like traffic weighting, header-based matching) that is only possible through customizations in Ingress API. Gateway API is role-oriented in that it defines three main roles: infrastructure provider, cluster operator, and application developer, who need to work together to use and configure Kubernetes service networking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/753&quot;&gt;Sidecar Containers&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new sidecar feature enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without native support. The lack of native support has caused some usage friction, which this enhancement aims to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new feature adds a new restartPolicy field to init containers that is available when the SidecarContainers feature gate is enabled. The field is optional and, if set, the only valid value is Always. Setting this field changes the behavior of init containers as follows: The container restarts if it exits. Any subsequent init container starts immediately after the startupProbe has successfully completed instead of waiting for the restartable init container to exit. The resource usage calculation changes for the pod as restartable init container resources are now added to the sum of the resource requests by the main containers. Pod termination continues to only depend on the main containers. An init container with a restartPolicy of Always (named a sidecar) won’t prevent the pod from terminating after the main containers exit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in Kubernetes 1.29, if your Pod includes one or more sidecar containers (init containers with an Always restart policy), the kubelet will delay sending the TERM signal to these sidecar containers until the last main container has fully terminated. The sidecar containers will be terminated in the reverse order they are defined in the Pod spec. This ensures that sidecar containers continue serving the other containers in the Pod until they are no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior of this beta capability in 1.29 is that sidecar containers that have a &lt;code&gt;PreStop&lt;/code&gt; hook will be notified when the Pod has begun terminating by executing the &lt;code&gt;PreStop&lt;/code&gt; hook. Once the last primary container terminates, the last started sidecar container is notified by sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt; signal. The next sidecar (in reverse order) is notified by sending a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt; signal after the previous sidecar container terminates. This continues until all sidecar containers have terminated, or the Pod’s termination grace period expires. In the latter case, all remaining containers are notified by a &lt;code&gt;SIGTERM&lt;/code&gt;, followed by a fixed grace period of 2 seconds and finally terminated. The Pod will be terminated after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that slow termination of a main container will also delay the termination of the sidecar containers. If the grace period expires before the termination process is complete, the Pod may enter emergency termination. In this case, all remaining containers in the Pod will be terminated simultaneously with a short grace period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if the Pod has a &lt;code&gt;preStop&lt;/code&gt; hook that exceeds the termination grace period, emergency termination may occur. In general, if you have used &lt;code&gt;preStop&lt;/code&gt; hooks to control the termination order without sidecar containers, you can now remove them and allow the kubelet to manage sidecar termination automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-api-machinery/4006-transition-spdy-to-websockets&quot;&gt;Transition SPDY to WebSockets&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This change aims to deprecate SPDY in favor of WebSockets for Kubernetes API server communications. WebSockets provide a more modern and scalable protocol that can improve the overall reliability and maintainability of Kubernetes communications. This can enhance security by making sure that the communication protocols used by Kubernetes are robust and well-supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These general enhancements contribute to a more secure and efficient Kubernetes environment. By improving Kubernetes’ underlying reliability, performance, and operational control, the above features lay the groundwork for a more secure infrastructure platform capable of hosting sensitive and critical workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Security in Kubernetes 1.29&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/2535-ensure-secret-pulled-images&quot;&gt;Ensure Secret Pulled Images&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Container images often contain sensitive components, making the security of image pull operations critical. The new alpha feature makes sure that images are always pulled using Kubernetes secrets of the Pod using them. This is important when Kubelet pulls an image for one Pod and another Pod is pointing to the same image. Up until now, the second Pod’s image request did not need authentication since it still used the first one’s credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access. By securing the image pull process, this enhancement prevents attackers from intercepting or tampering with container images, which is vital for maintaining the integrity of workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031&quot;&gt;SignedSigning Release Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume&lt;/code&gt; has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/2799-reduction-of-secret-based-service-account-token&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to “Bound Service Account Token Improvements” enhancement and narrowing the scope of service account tokens, this improvement seeks to reduce the reliance on long-lived secret-based service account tokens. By limiting the use of these tokens, the potential attack surface is significantly diminished. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This move aligns with the broader industry trend of short-lived, just-in-time credentials that minimize the chances of token leakage leading to unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-auth/3221-structured-authorization-configuration&quot;&gt;Structured Authentication Configuration&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the authorization counterpart, Kubernetes 1.29 provides another alpha feature for structured configuration for authentication mechanisms. This enhancement offers users a more maintainable and secure approach to managing authentication, allowing administrators to implement complex authentication schemes more efficiently and with less room for error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the new enhancement, it is now possible to configure multiple OIDC providers, clients, and validation rules:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endeavour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal. Dign into more details about deprecation, removals, and the latest changes in the 1.29 &lt;a href=&quot;https://relnotes.k8s.io/&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On behalf of the Layer5 community and all of the CNCF projects that its contributors steward, thank you to everyone who participated in this Kubernetes release, and congratulations! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#x27;s ahead for Kubernetes in 2024?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AI/MLOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI came into the world with a big splash this year and helmsman, Kubernetes, is here helping navigate the AI waters. While some people suggest that the CNCF and Kubernetes ecosystem is in catch up mode in context of GenAI, they perhaps, forget that OpenAI is running a 7,500 node Kubernetes cluster in the development and hosting of GPT-3, CLIP, DALL·E, and research on other models. Where I think that Kubernetes and the CNCF can improve is in embracing and enabling AI/ML as a forerunner of our workload use cases. The CNCF has a massive developer ecosystem that will that can be enabled with MLOps and new model training projects like Kubeflow with its Kartib and KFServing sub-projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking past YAML&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DZone’s annual trend report on Kubernetes in the Enterprise has 55% of respondents identifying &amp;quot;Maintaining YAML files” as one of the more significant, ongoing pain-points in their experience with Kubernetes. In 2024, I’m looking forward to CNCF projects like Meshery addressing this pain-point with &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshmap&quot;&gt;a visual designer for Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; resource and workflow configuration. The inability for some developers to either be capable of or have time to comprehend the intricacies of their virtualized applications by staring at endless lines of YAML is poised to significantly improve in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Navigating Hacktoberfest]]></title><description><![CDATA[How to have a great Hacktoberfest experience and get the most out of participating]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/open-source/navigating-hacktoberfest</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/open-source/navigating-hacktoberfest</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/7e7878515bc5a64e27221318931fe2c6/layer5-hacktoberfest-2023.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the leaves begin to turn and the air grows crisp, it can only mean one thing: &lt;a href=&quot;https://hacktoberfest.com&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt; is here! This annual celebration of open source, hosted by Digital Ocean, invites contributors from all over the world to participate in a month-long extravaganza of code contributions. While the allure of limited-edition swag may be enticing, it&amp;#x27;s essential to approach Hacktoberfest with a mindset focused on quality, respect for maintainers, and a commitment to long-term community engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 has a long history of participating in Hacktoberfest. 2023 is no different. Our annual &lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest kickoff and prep event&lt;/a&gt; (be sure to join) is tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Purposeful Participation: Beyond Swag Chasing and Profile Building&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you embark on your Hacktoberfest journey, take a moment to reflect on your motivation. Are you here solely for the swag, just for the green boxes in your GitHub profile, or do you genuinely want to make a meaningful contribution to a project, learn, grow, and make new friends in the process? Embrace the opportunity to forge lasting connections and dive deeper into topics that resonate with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Quality Over Quantity: Making a Lasting Impact&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a flurry of pull requests may be impressive, maintainers value contributions that add genuine value. Think beyond code and consider how your unique skills—whether in design, organization, or other areas can enrich the project. Open Source thrives on meaningful contributions, so let&amp;#x27;s aim to make a tangible difference, rather than settling for mediocrity. You will grow in the process and so will the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquotestyle__BlockquoteStyle-sc-1yeq4hm-0 bwvwmu blockquote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;blockquote-container&quot;&gt;&lt;h1 class=&quot;blockquote-quote&quot;&gt;When you are clear about what motivates you, each contribution you make will help you achieve your goals, because you will be working on projects that are aligned with your values.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;blockquote-person&quot;&gt;— Lee Calcote&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5 class=&quot;blockquote-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Guidelines Aren&amp;#x27;t Optional: Respecting the Playbook&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;That CONTRIBUTING.md file? It&amp;#x27;s not there for decoration. Treat it as your playbook, providing guidance for equitable collaboration. Ignoring these guidelines is akin to rearranging someone&amp;#x27;s furniture without permission. Established protocols are crucial, especially in projects with numerous contributors. They help navigate the intricacies of collaborative development. As an example, there is a full set of contributig docs written for Meshery - one for each component:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-gitflow&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery using git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/meshery-windows&quot;&gt;Setting up Meshery Development Environment on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/build-and-release&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Build and Release (CI)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cypress&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery&amp;#x27;s End-to-End Tests using Cypress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-adapters&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Adapters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docker-extension&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Docker Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-server&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-models&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Models&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-error&quot;&gt;How to write MeshKit compatible errors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery UI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-ui-notification-center&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery UI - Notification Center&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-docs&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery Docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli&quot;&gt;Contributing to Meshery CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/project/contributing/contributing-cli-guide&quot;&gt;Meshery CLI Contributing Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Upholding a Safe Environment: The Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect, collaboration, and kindness are the bedrock of Open Source. The Code of Conduct is non-negotiable, ensuring a secure and inclusive space for all contributors. Reporting mechanisms are in place to uphold these principles. As contributors, it is our duty to champion a culture of respect and security, nurturing an environment where creativity and innovation flourish. The &lt;a href=&quot;/community/handbook&quot;&gt;Layer5 Community Handbook&lt;/a&gt; offers an excellent reference for our community&amp;#x27;s culture norms and practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Engaging Beyond Code: Fostering Holistic Development&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t confine yourself to a GitHub profile. Engage in meaningful discussions, participate in webinars, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://discuss.layer5.io&quot;&gt;open discussions&lt;/a&gt;. Be a mentor and seek mentorship. Open Source offers a wealth of opportunities for comprehensive growth. While coding skills undoubtedly benefit, the real lessons often lie in understanding people and their diverse perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Compassion Over Code: Recognizing Maintainer Burnout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/handbook/repository-overview&quot;&gt;Maintainers&lt;/a&gt; are the unsung heroes of the open-source world, often overwhelmed by the Hacktoberfest influx. Your seemingly &amp;quot;simple&amp;quot; pull request may be the tipping point. Recognize their efforts and respect their capacity. Some projects may not actively seek new contributions, and that&amp;#x27;s perfectly valid. Begin by identifying projects explicitly welcoming newcomers, tagged with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Alayer5labs+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;good first issue&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;help wanted&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. The Virtue of Patience: Embracing the Long Game&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open source is a marathon, not a sprint. Feedback may take time, and collaboration may be challenging. Patience is the glue that holds this ecosystem together. Cultivate it as a fundamental habit in your contributor journey. The Layer5 &lt;a href=&quot;/community/members&quot;&gt;community members&lt;/a&gt; invest time, patience, understanding and offer endless hours of support to our contributors. Stick around and benefit. In turn, offer to help others. There&amp;#x27;s little better way to learn, than through teaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. Humility and Gratitude: The Essence of Meaningful Contributions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, a meaningful contribution is its own reward. Swag and a profile boost is a delightful bonus, not the end goal. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and learn from your experiences. As you recognize that you are part of a much larger movement, we &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/community/layer5-recognition-program&quot;&gt;recognize our contributors and users milestones&lt;/a&gt; each step of the way. Earn any number of &lt;a href=&quot;https://badges.layer5.io&quot;&gt;Layer5 badges&lt;/a&gt; as you grow with the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. Earn a Badge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earn a Hacktoberfest Contributor badge by contributing to Layer5 projects during this Hacktoberfest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/hacktoberfest-contributor-0c87d6b9edd34f4c7ac267254ac44dc4.png&quot; style=&quot;width:250px&quot;/&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Join Layer5&amp;#x27;s Hacktoberfest Event&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption&quot; style=&quot;width:80%&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/hacktoberfest-2023-with-layer5-d75ad4f9d2094005dd4e683555130e23.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;display:flex;gap:2rem&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/events/hacktoberfest-prep-2023-easing-into-cncf-open-source-projects&quot;&gt;Hacktoberfest Prep 2023: Easing into CNCF Open Source Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;DATE: September 29, 2023&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;TIME: 3PM UTC | 10AM Central | 8:30PM IST&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;EVENT: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meet.layer5.io/community&quot;&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Open GitHub Issues by Label:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22hacktoberfest%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hacktoberfest&amp;quot; issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;help wanted&amp;quot; issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Alayer5labs+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;good first issue&amp;quot; issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hacktoberfest is an opportunity for transformation, a time when contributors and maintainers can connect on a deeper level. Let&amp;#x27;s be the contributors that maintainers celebrate, rather than dread. Whether maintainers actively seek contributions or focus on internal tasks, respect their choices. Remember, we&amp;#x27;re all weaving the rich tapestry of the open-source community, and together, we&amp;#x27;re contributing to something far greater than a month-long treasure hunt. So, dive in, make a splash, and keep coming back for more than just the loot. Happy Hacking!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Unlocking the Power of WebAssembly in Service Mesh Management]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is a short summary of my blog post.

Maybe someone has even asked you to star their repository. If you&amp;#x27;ve ever wondered how much of an impact your star could make on their project, you&amp;#x27;re in the right place. Let&amp;#x27;s explore what GitHub Stars are and explore the significant role they play in boosting a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are GitHub Stars?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;GitHub stars are like virtual thumbs-up or bookmarks that you can give to projects you like on the GitHub platform. They&amp;#x27;re a way to show that you find a project interesting, useful, or valuable. When you star a project, when you star a project, it&amp;#x27;s represented at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meshery/meshery/stargazers&quot;&gt;stargazers&lt;/a&gt; section of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stars are one of the key metrics that GitHub uses to track and identify trending projects on its platform. When a repository gains a significant number of stars within a relatively short period, it can be an indicator that the project is gaining popularity, and consequently, qualifies as a &amp;quot;trending project&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#x27;s how GitHub uses stars to track trending projects:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Activity&lt;/strong&gt; -
GitHub monitors the rate at which repositories are being starred. Projects that receive a sudden surge of stars are likely to catch the attention of GitHub&amp;#x27;s algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Interval&lt;/strong&gt; -
GitHub takes into account the time frame within which stars are accumulated. Projects that gain stars rapidly in a short span of time are considered for trending status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relative Comparison&lt;/strong&gt; -
Trending repositories are often determined based on a comparison with their usual star activity. If a repository&amp;#x27;s star activity significantly exceeds its typical rate, it might be flagged as trending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency&lt;/strong&gt; -
While rapid stars are important, consistent activity also matters. Projects that sustain their increased star activity over time are more likely to be recognized as trending.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a repository meets these criteria, it might be highlighted on GitHub&amp;#x27;s Trending page or other curated sections of the platform. This visibility can attract even more attention and stars, creating a feedback loop that amplifies the project&amp;#x27;s popularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Effect of Stars on a Project&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starring a project on GitHub does not directly impact the project’s functionality, but it can have several positive effects which include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visibility&lt;/strong&gt; -
Starring a project increases its visibility. Projects with more stars tend to appear higher in search results, making it easier for others to discover and contribute to the project&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community Engagement&lt;/strong&gt; -
A higher number of stars can attract more contributors, users, and potential collaborators. It indicates that the project has generated interest and resonates with others.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation&lt;/strong&gt; -
For project maintainers and contributors, seeing their project receive stars can be motivating. It shows that their work is appreciated and valued by the community.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recognition&lt;/strong&gt; - Starring a project is a way for users to acknowledge and recognize the effort put into it. It’s a form of social validation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributor Potential&lt;/strong&gt; - Potential contributors might use the number of stars a project has as a signal of the project’s importance and popularity. A well-started project might attract developers looking for projects to contribute to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback and Support&lt;/strong&gt; - Starring can also serve as a lightweight way for users to express their support for the project or to keep track of projects they find interesting even if they don’t actively contribute.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, starring a project helps create a positive cycle where visibility leads to engagement, engagement leads to contributions, and contributions lead to a stronger project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Star a Repository&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starring a repository is a simple two-step process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt; On &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/meshery/meshery&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, navigate to the main page of the repository.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; At the top-right corner of the page, click Star.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/before-5af3f194d9e1fbc380e882ef34e9f8fd.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before adding a star&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;display:flex;justify-content:center&quot;&gt; This is what a project will look like after you have starred it: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;imgWithCaption&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/after-20552f5c81a0de6fb0b053f6f9cb0f51.png&quot;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adding a star&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Five Needs Your Stars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you understand how much impact stars can make, take a moment to help &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/five/vol1/mascot-five-adventure-github-stars.pdf&quot;&gt;Five on his Cloud Native journey&lt;/a&gt;.

Among the updates in Kubernetes 1.28 are enhancements designed to help with resiliency, including the ability to recover from non-graceful node shutdowns. There are also a series of networking-related enhancements that will enable better security and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As is the case with every Kubernetes release, there is a theme and a code name; for Kubernetes 1.28 the name is “Planternetes.” “So in the northern hemisphere, it’s summer right now and I think the symbolism of the garden and our community goes hand in hand,” Grace Nguyen, release lead for Kubernetes 1.28, told SDxCentral. “Each of us has a very important role in the ecosystem and together we built this big, open-source project that has a lot of impact.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Networking enhancements in Kubernetes 1.28&lt;/h3&gt;Looking specifically at the networking capabilities of Kubernetes 1.28, there are a few enhancements that will also help to improve overall performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/community/members/lee-calcote/bio&quot;&gt;Lee Calcote&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;Layer5&lt;/a&gt; and a CNCF contributor, explained that one of the key networking updates is an enhancement to the kube-proxy feature that will enable better connection-draining capabilities for load balancers targeting terminating nodes.&lt;p&gt;“This enhancement improves the reliability of load balancer health checks and connection draining for terminating nodes within Kubernetes, so that kube-proxy can independently report its health regardless of the terminating state of the node,” Calcote told SDxCentral. “In this way, cloud providers in particular can be more sophisticated in ascertaining if a load balancer should target a specific node for ingress traffic or not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also of note in Kubernetes 1.28 for networking is IPv4 to IPv6 dual-stack transition support for Kubernetes pods. Calcote explained that this enhancement allows pods to access information about both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses associated with the node they are running on, thereby enhancing their ability to adapt to dual-stack network transitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud-native networking beyond Kubernetes
While Kubernetes has many built-in capabilities, extensibility of the platform is a key attribute as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calcote explained that proxies running in Kubernetes are quite powerful and many support on-the-fly insertion or removal of traffic filters as plugins, with technologies like Envoy, Traefik, and NGINX as prime examples. He noted that each technology varies in support for the chaining of multiple filters and for the programming languages in which developers can create these filters. Envoy, in particular, supports WebAssembly (WASM)-based filters, which means that a number of different languages are supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Kubernetes has yet to address this deeper area of network traffic management, which is where CNCF projects like &lt;a href=&quot;https://meshery.io/&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; step in with WASM filter management for any Envoy proxy or Envoy-based service-mesh data plane,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.28 has deep roots for stability
Nguyen noted that there are some 45 enhancements in the Kubernetes 1.28 update, spanning new stable, beta and alpha capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is widely deployed on public cloud providers and is also used as the foundation of several commercial offerings, including one from IBM‘s Red Hat business unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The latest release of Kubernetes has a number of enhancements to help increase the stability, performance and maintainability of the core platform while also augmenting workload innovation, including AI [artificial intelligence] and virtual machines,” Karena Angell, OpenShift Commons lead and senior principal product manager for Red Hat OpenShift and Hybrid Platforms, told SDxCentral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angell said Red Hat is particularly interested in the new node system memory swap support that has been added to Kubernetes 1.28 to enable better memory performance across a cluster. Additionally, she noted that the Kubernetes Job API now allows for more choices in AI model training and retraining, which is especially key for AI-driven and intelligent workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As Kubernetes continues to mature as a platform with release 1.28, we’re very happy to see a number of new features and tweaks that further support production stability and consistency,” Angell said. “Large and complicated jobs can now fail faster and more accurately which, while it sounds strange, contributes to better overall performance of Kubernetes in production.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layer5 💚's Open Source]]></title><description><![CDATA[HashiCorp Relicensing and Layer5's Partnership]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/announcements/layer5-s-open-source</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/announcements/layer5-s-open-source</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/72bc74d6687454f7700b4af70521f97a/layer5-open-source.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/08/10/2723189/0/en/HashiCorp-adopts-the-Business-Source-License-for-future-releases-of-its-products.html&quot;&gt;HashiCorp announced a change in their source code license&lt;/a&gt; from Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) to the Business Source License (BSL, or BUSL) v1.1, effective in all future releases of HashiCorp’s core products, including Terraform, Vault, Consul, Boundary, Nomad, Waypoint, Packer, and Vagrant.

This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start&quot;&gt;set up&lt;/a&gt; on your local machine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Create a Service Account&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named &lt;code&gt;my-service-account&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Create a ClusterRole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;#x27;s create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt; that has read-only access to Pods and Services:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

with the ClusterRole &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt;. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role-binding&lt;/code&gt; that associates the Service Account &lt;code&gt;my-service-account&lt;/code&gt; with the ClusterRole &lt;code&gt;my-cluster-role&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the &lt;code&gt;Subjects&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;RoleRef&lt;/code&gt; sections, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kubernetes clusters&lt;/a&gt;. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Install Meshery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refer to the official Meshery &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Access MeshMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://playground.meshery.io/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the &amp;quot;Generate Map&amp;quot; button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster&amp;#x27;s architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster&amp;#x27;s lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Changing Meshery Release Channels]]></title><description><![CDATA[Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes being added regularly.

To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; How release channels offer subscription &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release Channels offers a subscription where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery. However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it&amp;#x27;s important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It&amp;#x27;s recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token builtin class-name&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(255, 203, 139)&quot;&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;stable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;stable-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(127, 219, 202)&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;edge-version&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel set stable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt; Switching between Release Channels&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we&amp;#x27;ll cover both methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is Meshconfig?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the &lt;code&gt;~/.meshery/config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  &lt;code&gt;mesheryctl version&lt;/code&gt;. If you don&amp;#x27;t have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl&quot;&gt;Meshery documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create new Meshery config.yaml file &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-language=bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context create [context-name]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;Example: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes &lt;/code&gt;&lt;li&gt; To view the newly created meshery context use &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context view &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;context-name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot; style=&quot;color:rgb(199, 146, 234)&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here&amp;#x27;s how:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system context view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/meshery-version-5dbe26bc558062b5cc58ff22a8e88b49.png&quot; class=&quot;image-center&quot; style=&quot;width:50%&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will show you the currently channels ,&lt;b&gt;stable&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;edge&lt;/b&gt;, along with the version number and other information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;li&gt;Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel switch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;This command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus. To switch the channel to a specific version, replace &lt;b&gt;Version&lt;/b&gt; with the desired version number.&lt;li&gt; To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again: &lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-bash&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;mesheryctl system channel view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward process. You can do it using mesheryctl or by switching between your meshconfig file. Whether you want stable updates or bleeding-edge features, Meshery has a release channel that suits your needs. Just remember to carefully consider your use case and needs before making any changes to ensure that you have the best Meshery experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Internship Experience with Layer5 - Sudhanshu Dasgupta]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sharing my internship and open-source experience with this awesome community Layer5]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/community/internship-experience-with-layer5-sudhanshu-dasgupta</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/community/internship-experience-with-layer5-sudhanshu-dasgupta</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sudhanshu Dasgupta]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jun 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/c0143974ad8216b2572f5f2bd5093633/sudhanshu.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello👋, I&amp;#x27;m Sudhanshu Dasgupta, a driven individual from the quaint city of Katni in Madhya Pradesh, India.

As a newbie to open-source, I was unsure about many things, but Shivam ( an amazing contributor ), welcomed me and suggested I should attend the Meshery Dev meet to learn more.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I picked up some issues and started working on them but soon hit a wall. Then one day, Lee Calcote messaged me and said he had me on his intern&amp;#x27;s list, but noticed I wasn&amp;#x27;t around the community much. So I reached out to Abhishek and Gaurav for help on how to get more involved. They showed me how to contribute and help others, and then I started attending dev calls, helping others, and making new friends.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”After a while, I received a message from Lee and Gaurav saying that I would look good in the MeshMate logo I was surprised. It was one of the best things to happen to me, but also came with a responsibility to help others in the community and guide them on their journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re a MeshMate and have been for some long time now. What does being a MeshMate mean to you? What does it take to be a successful MeshMate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Being a MeshMate is not just an honor, it is also a responsibility towards the community. MeshMates are individuals who are committed to help other members of the community. This includes ensuring that community members have access to resources, are introduced to other members, and understand the vision and goals of the projects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have always loved learning in a community because with a community, we can grow together. Similarly, MeshMates always make sure that their mentees are successful along with the project. It&amp;#x27;s a great feeling to be a part of a community where everyone is working towards the same goal and supporting each other along the way.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I remember introducing Meshery and Meshmap in my college event. It was an incredibly successful event, and I take great pride in being a part of a community that supports such innovative projects. The response from the attendees was overwhelming, and I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the contributors who played a pivotal role in making this project a resounding success. Their collective efforts truly deserve admiration and appreciation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your favorite part of the Layer5 Community? Of being a MeshMate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I joined Layer5 community I got a welcome message with helping instructions so that I can contribute smoothly and I think this shows how much this community cares about their contributors which I like most about Layer5, everyone here is so welcoming and helping.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Being a MeshMate you get exposure in community which is really good for your growth but this is not best part of being a MeshMate, the best part is the feeling you get after helping someone and being little part of their success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the number of people  that join the Layer5 community everyday, how do you deal with the continued influx of newcomers?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Layer5 is big community over 4000+ members on slack and everyday so many people join Layer5 community and connecting with newcomers everyday is really not easy it takes time and your little strength too but as I said earliar, being a MeshMate also comes with responsibility which I enjoy most 😎.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impressively, you’re also a software engineering intern at Layer5. How did this come to be? What are some personal goals for the next year with respect to the Meshery and the Layer5 community?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Truelly I never joined Layer5 with mindset of internship after I joined Layer5 I saw here people learning new things as they are working on projects, making growth in their personality and improving engineering skills which is what I actually want. Layer5 offers internships all the time and these internships are offered to those who make impact in community and contribute consistently. After 2 months of making impact and contributing consistently I got mail with offer of internship.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Layer5 is growing everyday and many people started using Meshery, MeshMap and other projects for their businesses with this growth my personal goal is to work start helping projects in field of Devops and backend and also I like learning and sharing in public so I’ll also try to spread word of what we do here to appreciate everyone&amp;#x27;s effort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve heard of Community Badges, but what are these? How many are there? More importantly, how do I collect the whole set?! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Haha the way you are making impact in community soon you’ll get all Vivek, Badges are signs of contributors&amp;#x27; efforts in their respective fields given by community. There are different badges for different efforts and I have this which represents MeshMate. I would really like to see you getting so many badges Vivek 😉.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Badges are not also easy to take, this requires your efforts and time towards community and its projects. As I said Layer5 community always wants its contributors&amp;#x27; success because with their success it’s layer5&amp;#x27;s success and badges are one of the ways of recognising contributors&amp;#x27; efforts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your most often used emoji? Your preference: movie or book? Morning person or night owl? What have you worked on in the past six months that you’re particularly proud of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;😂 some of my favourite questions, I really like using this 🚀 emoji which represents the feeling of keep doing and keep pushing until it&amp;#x27;s done. I am mostly a night person, as I feel most productive during that time, although I don&amp;#x27;t recommend it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I worked on different projects of Layer5 and I am proud for all of them though my favorite part is getting Meshery and MeshMap support default dark mode so that user will get smooth experience of using Meshery or MeshMap &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cloud native ecosystem moves quickly. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. How do you stay up-to-date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes Cloud native ecosystem is so vast and constantly evolving. I think being part of cloud native community helps me stay up-to-date with its fast moving ecosystem and I’ll also suggest everyone to join community from any platform you like Slack, Twitter or your favorite platform &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As I said Cloud native is so vast so as it’s community too there are so many updated resources available out their on internet by community, which helps me to keep update with Cloud native ecosystem&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewer&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vivek:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What  advice do you have for individuals who are hopeful to become Layer5 contributors, interns, or potentially MeshMates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;interviewee&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yash:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Try to come out of your comfort zone. If you are reading this conversation, you are already out of your comfort zone, which is a really good step. Who I am today is because I came out of my comfort zone, which I would also prefer. Lastly, be more helpful towards the community and, most importantly, be consistent. I wish you success.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/static/forklift.81115a37.svg&quot; height=&quot;100px&quot;/&gt;&lt;p&gt;The open source community at Layer5 is an award winning program and continues to evolve as it grows in number daily. Its projects and activities move at an impressive pace thanks to MeshMates like Yash. Be like Yash. Join the &lt;a href=&quot;/community&quot;&gt;Layer5 Community&lt;/a&gt; and say “hi”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kubernetes NodePorts - Static and Dynamic Assignments]]></title><description><![CDATA[Avoiding Port Collisions with Kubernetes NodePorts Static and Dynamic Assignments]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes provides a Service to offer a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. While it offers a VIP to the clients for access and Kubernetes ensures traffic balancing for the accessing back-end Pods, it has a limitation of routing traffic from outside the cluster. The Kubernetes Service setting of &amp;quot;NodePort&amp;quot; was created to overcome this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting up a mapping to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, a NodePort Service redirects traffic from the outside to the inside of the cluster. When a NodePort Service is created, Kubernetes control plane allocates its corresponding ports in two ways. The first is dynamic, where Kubernetes control plane automatically assigns an unused port at the creation time. The second is static, which assigns a port within the nodeport port range configuration. It is crucial to assign a unique nodePort across the entire cluster while manually assigning nodePort, or it will result in an error if a service of type NodePort already uses that port. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, there is a need to run a NodePort Service on well-known ports so that other components and users inside or outside the cluster can use them. In such cases, users need to reserve the required ports before using them. Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature gate &amp;quot;ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange&amp;quot; that allows users to use a different port allocation strategy for type NodePort Services. Enabling this feature gate will divide the port range for NodePort Services based on a formula that uses nodeport size and determines the size of the static port range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a few examples of different port ranges and their band offset values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;table-3&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Range properties&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;service-node-port-range&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000-32767&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band Offset&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;86&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30085&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30086&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;32767&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;table-3&quot;&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Range properties&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Values&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;service-node-port-range&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000-30015&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Band Offset&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;16&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Static band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;30015&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band start&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Dynamic band end&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;N/A&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;NodePort Services can be useful in many scenarios. For example, consider a user that needs to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients running outside the Kubernetes cluster. The agreed port is 30009, and the user needs to create a Service as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-undefined&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb;background-color:#011627&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;apiVersion: v1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;kind: Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;metadata:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  name: minio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;spec:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  ports:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  - name: api&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    nodePort: 30009&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    port: 9000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    protocol: TCP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    targetPort: 9000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  selector:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;    app: minio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;token-line&quot; style=&quot;color:#d6deeb&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;CodeBlock__LineNo-sc-4qx7vm-1 kjXyGE&quot;&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token plain&quot;&gt;  type: NodePort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the port required for the Minio Service is not reserved and another NodePort (or possibly LoadBalancer) Service is created and dynamically allocated before or concurrently with the Minio Service, the TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that other Service. In this case, creation of the Minio Service will fail due to a node port collision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, using the NodePort Service will help Kubernetes users by allowing traffic to be routed from outside to inside the cluster, providing a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. By enabling the ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange feature gate, users can adopt a different port allocation strategy, reducing the risk of collisions while using a different range of ports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Building amazing open source tools one contributor at-a-time]]></title><description><![CDATA[Layer5 is an award-winning open community of supportive contributors]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/community/building-amazing-open-source-tools-one-contributor-at-a-time</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/community/building-amazing-open-source-tools-one-contributor-at-a-time</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Lee Calcote]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/cc6ab8b14b02269edd534f69a6117c04/4000-layer5-members.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Layer5 open source community has reached a milestone that deserves to be celebrated: we&amp;#x27;re now 4,000 members and growing.

As part of its functionality, Kubernetes offers a feature called &amp;quot;Admission Controllers&amp;quot; that allow administrators to enforce certain policies on resources being created in the cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will be discussing a new feature in Kubernetes called &amp;quot;Validating Admission Policies&amp;quot; which is currently in alpha stage. This feature allows administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster and enforce those rules using admission controllers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are Admission Controllers?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admission controllers are pluggable components in the Kubernetes API server that intercept requests to create, update, or delete resources in the cluster. They allow administrators to enforce certain policies on these requests before they are persisted in the etcd database and acted upon by the Kubernetes control plane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are various types of admission controllers available in Kubernetes, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NamespaceLifecycle&lt;/strong&gt;: This admission controller enforces policies related to namespace creation and deletion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LimitRanger&lt;/strong&gt;: This admission controller enforces resource limits on pods, such as CPU and memory limits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PodSecurityPolicy&lt;/strong&gt;: This admission controller enforces security policies on pods, such as privileged mode, host networking, and volumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Validating Admission Policies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validating admission policies allow administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster. These rules can be defined using a custom resource definition (CRD) called &amp;quot;ValidatingWebhookConfiguration&amp;quot; and are enforced by the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, an administrator may want to enforce a policy that requires all pods in the cluster to have a specific label. They can define this rule using a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration CRD and configure the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller to enforce it. Any request to create a pod that does not have the required label will be rejected by the admission controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validating admission policies also allow administrators to use external webhooks to perform the validation. This can be useful when the validation logic is complex or requires access to external resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validating admission policies is a new feature in Kubernetes that allows administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster. These rules can be enforced using the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller, and external webhooks can also be used for complex validation logic. This feature can be useful for enforcing policies and ensuring compliance in a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Most Innovative Cloud Management Companies]]></title><description><![CDATA[Layer5 stands out as one of the most innovative cloud management companies among 100,000 Texas-based startups, acknowledged for its exceptional performance in company track record, executive leadership, market share, innovation, and ESG rating.]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/company/news/the-most-innovative-cloud-management-companies</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/company/news/the-most-innovative-cloud-management-companies</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Best Startup Texas]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/bc8c3bab97b6d1c1577838cfae767899/best-startup-texas.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Newsstyle__NewsWrapper-sc-12r6uiw-0 DQvaY&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Layer5 is featured as one of the most innovative cloud management companies by Best Startup Texas.

It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: &lt;a href=&quot;/cloud-native-management/meshery&quot;&gt;Meshery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/cloud-native-performance&quot;&gt;Service Mesh Performance&lt;/a&gt;. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of enhancments tracked in this release (38), you need to be aware that there are also a number of features being deprecated (10) in 1.26. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, important deprecations, and removals so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#x27;ll breakdown new K8s features by category, starting with networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Networking in Kubernetes 1.26&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2086&quot;&gt;Service Internal Traffic Policy&lt;/a&gt; [Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When requests are made to a Kubernetes service, they are randomly distributed to all available endpoints. The new enhancement enriches the API of a service to use node-local and topology-aware routing for internal traffic. The new internalTrafficPolicy field has two options: Cluster (default) and Local. The Cluster option works like before and tries distributing requests to all available endpoints. On the other hand, the Local option only sends requests to node-local endpoints and drops the request if there is no available instance on the same node. The Local option is useful for sending metrics or logs to an agent running as a DaemonSet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3070&quot;&gt;Reserve Service IP Ranges for Dynamic and Static IP Allocation&lt;/a&gt; [Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes services are assigned a virtual ClusterIP to be reachable inside the cluster. The ClusterIP is either assigned dynamically from a configured Service IP range, or statically set while creating the service resource. There was no possibility of knowing whether another service in the cluster had already used the static ClusterIP before this new stable enhancement. With this change, the IP range is divided into two; this prevents conflicts between services implementing dynamic IP allocation and static IP assignment. The flag --service-cluster-ip-range, with CIDR notation, is part of the Kubernetes API server configuration and is ready to use with the 1.26 release. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1435&quot;&gt;Support of Mixed Protocols in Services with Type LoadBalancer&lt;/a&gt; [Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes Services that use the LoadBalancer type have only supported a single Layer 4 protocol until now. With this enhancement going from graduating to stable in v1.26, it is possible to define a mix of protocols in the same service definition. In other words, this enhancement allows a LoadBalancer Service to serve different protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP) under the same port (e.g. 443). For example, serving both UDP and TCP requests for a DNS or SIP server on the same port. For instance, you can expose a DNS server with a single load balancer IP for both TCP and UDP requests, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC&quot;&gt;&lt;button class=&quot;CodeBlock__CopyCode-sc-4qx7vm-2 eEbfDY&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/button&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;CodeBlock__Pre-sc-4qx7vm-0 gDUqQC prism-code language-yaml&quot;

[Stable]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kubelet agent has a built-in credential provider mechanism to retrieve credentials for container image registries. It natively supports Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS container image registries for dynamically retrieving their credentials. The new stable enhancement in v1.26 offers a replacement for the in-tree implementations, and creates an API for extensible plugins in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031&quot;&gt;SignedSigning Release Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799&quot;&gt;Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume&lt;/code&gt; has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1981&quot;&gt;Windows Privileged Containers&lt;/a&gt; [Stable] and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3503&quot;&gt;Host Networking&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privileged containers are the ones that have similar access and capabilities to the host processes running on the servers. In Linux environments, they are used heavily in Kubernetes for storage, networking, and management. In this release, support for privileged containers for the Windows environment graduates to stable. Management of processes is heavily different from the operating system standpoint in Linux and Windows. Therefore, privileged containers will also work differently in two environments, but they will ensure the same level of security and operational experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, there is a new alpha-level enhancement in this release to support host networking for Windows pods. Currently, Windows has all the functionality to make containers use the networking namespace of the nodes. The new alpha enhancement enables this functionality from the Kubernetes side, increasing the parity between Linux and Windows containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/33250&quot;&gt;Self-User Attribute and Authentication API&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has no resources to identify and manage users as part of its API. Instead, it uses authenticators to get user attributes from tokens, certificates, OIDC providers, or webhooks. The new alpha feature adds a new API endpoint to see what attributes the current users have. The new API is under authentication.k8s.io with the name SelfSubjectReview, and there is a new corresponding command as well: kubectl auth who-am-i. The new feature will reduce the obscurity of complex authentication and help users debug the authentication stack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scheduling in Kubernetes 1.26&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2268&quot;&gt;Non-Graceful Node Shutdown for StatefulSet Pods&lt;/a&gt; [Beta]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a platform Kubernetes is hardened and has been deploy by thousands and thousands of users. Hardening of Kubernetes makes itself resistant to disasters. The kubelet agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster already uses graceful node shutdown to detect and offboard workloads to other nodes. However, when the shutdown is not detected by the kubelet, the pods of a &lt;code&gt;StatefulSet&lt;/code&gt; are stuck as &lt;code&gt;Terminating&lt;/code&gt; and not transferred to a healthy node. The kubelet on the downed node will not delete its pods from Kubernetes API, and the StatefulSet controller will not create new pods with the same name. This happens due to a conflict in the Kubernetes machinery. With this enhancement moving into beta, though, pods will be forcefully deleted along with their volume attachments and new pods will be migrated (created) on healthy nodes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3521&quot;&gt;Pod Scheduling Readiness&lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, pods are considered ready for scheduling as soon as they are created. However, not every pod requires a node, resource allocation, and the start of all its containers immediately after its creation. The new alpha enhancement adds an API to mark pods with their scheduling status: paused and ready. Pods with the .spec.schedulingGates field will be parked in the scheduler and only be assigned to nodes when they are ready to be scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3515&quot;&gt;kubectl explain to use OpenAPI v3 for &lt;/a&gt; [Alpha]&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use of OpenAPI v3 means supporting rich type information in &lt;code&gt;kubectl explan&lt;/code&gt;. Kubernetes has supported OpenAPI v3 as a beta since version 1.24. This richer representation of the fields in the Kubernetes API, means that users can use the &lt;code&gt;kubectl explain&lt;/code&gt; command to get information that is only detailed in  OpenAPI v3, and not the subset defined OpenAPI v2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Deprecations and Removals&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistent to the Kubernetes API lifecycle is deprecations and removals of APIs in each release. It is strongly suggested to check whether you are using the following APIs and flags before there are breaking changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of the `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group for `FlowSchema` and `PriorityLevelConfiguration` requires a migration to the v1beta2 API version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of the `autoscaling/v2beta2` API version for HorizontalPodAutoscaler requires a migration to the autoscaling/v2 API version.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of legacy and vendor-specific authentication client-go and kubectl for Azure and Google Cloud requires migration to vendor-neutral authentication plugin mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Removal of in-tree CSI integration for OpenStack—namely, the `cinder` volume type—requires a migration to use the CSI driver for OpenStack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some unused options and flags for the kubectl run command are marked as deprecated in the 1.26 release, such as `--grace-period`, `--timeout`, and `--wait`.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Last Kubernetes release of 2022&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes is an ever-evolving platform. For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endevour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal.

One of the key components of Kubernetes is its logging and instrumentation capabilities. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.26 release has a handful of noteworthy changes to its system component logger, &lt;code&gt;klog&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kubernetes System Log&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;System component logs record events happening in K8s clusters. More than metrics or traces, logs are the telemetric signal often found to be most useful for debugging. You can configure K8s log verbosity to see more or less detail. Logs can be as coarse-grained as showing errors within a component, or as fine-grained as showing step-by-step traces of events (like HTTP access logs, pod state changes, controller actions, or scheduler decisions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Klog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kubernetes/klog&quot;&gt;klog&lt;/a&gt; is a Kubernetes logging library that provides an API for developers and system administrators to instrument their applications for logging and tracing. klog generates log messages for the Kubernetes system components. It provides a comprehensive set of features, including log levels, structured logging and logging context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes 1.23 introduced structured logging (in beta) in &lt;code&gt;klog&lt;/code&gt;. Structured logging is a uniform structure in log messages allowing for programmatic extraction of information. Structured logs can be stored and processed with less effort and cost. The code which generates a log message determines whether it uses the traditional unstructured &lt;code&gt;klog&lt;/code&gt; output or structured logging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a dependency to structured logging (gated behind &lt;code&gt;StructuredLogging&lt;/code&gt; feature gate), Kubernetes 1.24 introducted contextual logging (in alpha) in &lt;code&gt;klog&lt;/code&gt;. Contextual logging builds on top of structured logging. It is primarily about how developers use logging calls: code based on that concept is more flexible and supports additional use cases which will be the topic of a future blog post. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Klog Deprecations in Kubernetes 1.26&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes has recently announced that it intends to deprecate certain flags related to Klog in its components. This means that Klog-specific flags, such as &lt;code&gt;--klog-verbosity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--klog-vmodule&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--klog-stderrthreshold&lt;/code&gt; will no longer be supported. This is due to the fact that Klog has been largely superseded by the more comprehensive OpenTelemetry project, which provides a more complete solution for logging and instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes as it moves to OpenTelemetry. This move will ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard logging and instrumentation solution. It will also provide developers and system administrators with a more comprehensive, reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.
A goal of this deprecation is one of unblocking development of alternative logging formats. Why does Kubnernetes need another logging format? One reason is performance. Klog performance is much worse than alternatives, for example 7-8x than JSON format:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;logger&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;time [ns/op]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;bytes[B/op]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;allocations[alloc/op]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Text Infof&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2252&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;248&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Text InfoS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2455&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;280&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;JSON Infof&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1406&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;JSON InfoS&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;319&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;67&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proof of concept implementation of new logging formats were completed to assess the potentional gains of using an alternative format. Results measured on 30s benchmark for passing 2 arguments to format function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;tip&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tip: Logger Performance Comparison&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Klog isn&amp;#x27;t the fastest logger in the West, but Uber&amp;#x27;s open source project &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/uber-go/zap&quot;&gt;zap &lt;/a&gt; appears to hold that title instead. The following performance test benchmark is an examle of one of a number of scenarios in which loggers can be performance analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log a message and 10 fields:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Package&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Time&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Time % to zap&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Objects Allocated&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;zap&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;2900 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+0%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;5 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;zap (sugared)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;3475 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+20%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;10 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;zerolog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;10639 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+267%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;32 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;go-kit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;14434 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+398%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;59 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;logrus&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;17104 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+490%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;81 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;apex/log&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;32424 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+1018%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;66 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;log15&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;33579 ns/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;+1058%&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;76 allocs/op&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Output will always be written to stderr, regardless of the output format. Output redirection is expected to be handled by the component which invokes a Kubernetes component. This can be a POSIX shell or a tool like systemd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deprecation of Klog-specific flags is part of a larger effort to transition Kubernetes to a more modern and comprehensive logging and instrumentation solution. This will provide Kubernetes users with a more reliable, secure and consistent experience when instrumenting and monitoring their applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kubernetes will continue to provide support for Klog-specific flags for the foreseeable future. However, it is recommended that developers and system administrators begin transitioning their applications to the OpenTelemetry framework. This will ensure that their applications are using the industry-standard solution for logging and instrumentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes. It will ensure that Kubernetes users have access to the most reliable and comprehensive solution for logging and instrumentation. It will also help ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard solution and will provide developers and system administrators with a more reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Layer5 at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America]]></title><description><![CDATA[Layer5 projects on stage at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon NA 2022]]></description><link>https://layer5.io/blog/events/layer5-at-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://layer5.io/blog/events/layer5-at-kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Deepesha Burse]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2022 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="https://layer5.io/static/0d800bca99f7acdcae43216137b09813/kubeconNA2022.webp" length="0" type="image/webp"/><content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;Blogstyle__BlogWrapper-sc-di69nl-0 ebZMcE&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detroit welcomes the largest open-cloud and container-based developer events and workshops in the world.
